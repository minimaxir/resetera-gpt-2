~!~West Virginia sets back $1.2 billion to restore body casket case file

Volimar: This link provided article mentions about something called "Special Counsel Review Report."
-----
hippopotamus: So does West Virginia become a Chinese sweatshop?
-----
Ether_Snake: Unfortunately, this should be widely known since these don't seem to change the fact that there are likely even actual lawsuits going on that may be involved. The only information about this, as far as I know, is that a federal judge changed the original case to make it go back to a different judge that even said was not trying to hold info of any kind.
-----
JCX: Basically the party in charge here is "narrowing it down to the most essential elements, so as to make them profitable."
Whatever shit they’re pulling doesn’t change anything.
-----
Trace: Victimhood should be a crime. They were just trying to require personal accountability for bodies accepted by corporations in exchange for favors in exchange for their survival. 
These assholes frequently call the victimhood into question because afterward the GOP continues to victimize victims, but this is a necessary step to actually get systems in place to prevent those crimes from happening.

Dream Machine: This seems out of nowhere.

doop_: Oops. I'll retract my statement. West died for dumb same-sex marriage being legal but I needed that life, even for your own confused gif.

Are I being cheap? Is it an adaptation to modern hardware?

-----
supremeplatypus: What is wrong with them being in opposition? Are they missing the disruptive potential of artificial borders, that make it harder to get into all kinds of businesses to get off at all??
They are following an unusual path with this shit, choosing to remain in the EU for a deal which will keep people out of the UK and relying on other able-bodied radicals to do their part. This is irredeemable.

~!~The problem with Oil for cars

Thisman: I was thinking maybe this is just a marketing ploy , but how is this so lucrative for big brands that need a manufactured “oil” for cars (that’s a cheaper and more environmentally friendly option). Does this mean these cars need jobs so a few kilometers behind them is not getting slammed for the right reasons, especially since manufacturing costs are usually much lower than raw oil competition which places higher your truck cost ranking at the top than the pure oil price (less than or equal to oil, oh so tiny to the point it’s half the price of what’s on the market)?
I’m not saying buying larger engines highly suggests the whole car isn’t doing itself any favors.
-----
Funky Papa: Gasoline or oil for cars at this point?
-----
sabrina: Can't imagine a million dollar, that's not oil for cars.
-----
Wackamole: What? Who ever thought it was this dumb? Does it really matter from a Canadian perspective if the "economy" is stagnant? Isn't that what politicians do.
-----
Bitanator: Why cuz baby peaches
-----
JakeNoseIt: I'm sure the people complaining about cars that just as easily run out and blow up cars that are as bad would agree that "Oil is not a marketing ploy" is an actual reality.
More people need to learn to live with shoddy oil and then there could be more reasons for why they won't learn by then.
-----
R0987: This kinda comes off as a negative stance despite what a lot of people will say but I see no wrong as long as the production is good or even better, I wouldn't buy one.

~!~Official Vos "suspends" child porn should I be fucking offended?

LewieP: Edit: This is the Official Thread
Basically, Vos is a huge platform for all sorts of vile shit: pedophiles, racist, white supremacists, bigots, misogynists, cry queens, rape cunts, bigots who harass various religions, and you can even apply it to atheism.
He's called a pedophile in multiple official materials (not saying it's not important at all, but pointed out the logo is not affiliated with Vos) and probably elsewhere, but what I won't quote is his outright dismissal of any kind of accusations ([QUOTE] he's even been affiliated with another party since 2012 or so, when I was younger), and of course without questions.
His words just don't seem to cut it anymore, with the very vague accusation that, to quote some, "The alt-right fueled my rise from an immigrant to a Jew, supporting transphobia and many others, and that I harbor entire family members who are part of that hate movement."
His primary contention (other than column inches) is that he doesn't have enough evidence for his accusation, that dated exclusively to 2015, to have anyone credibly believe him, and believe him too. It seems that this quash was only brought to light after a lawyer named Theodore Jenkins (and found him tacking and being charged with extortion lmao) started to convince Vos to drop his charges. If anything, this put that other party, Gateway, in a more spotlight and spotlight for a little while.
I would love for vos fullstop called the "greatest of the Greek gods" thing to lose their position like this and commentate it into infeasible words.
Better to have a life of constructive discourse where anyone can argue instead of the smashing of any notion. Instead of just, as always, just? And strongly refusing to admit a particular situation without admitting that there is something to it, let to say. Agendas without volition!

~!~Call your anti-facist uncle

Randam: So a year or so ago, I saw a person asking on the internet whether he opposed the Black Nation. I told him he couldn't say that because propagating lies, but then told him to keep it to himself and forget it. The next day I saw someone else reply and I said: Take the matter up with your father, but leave it to your mother to rule on your behalf.
I had always seen the crazy person first before my time, and even before me, I made the mistake of asking him “what’s your name?' and he told me that it was his mother. I gave him two chances, and he just didn’t deny it.
My mother handled it really well. He never gets the “I have your memory erased” or “my memory erased!”
So now I’m replying to them with a (very simple, polite) “I have two names and the United States of America. Your mother didn’t hold up your o

I understand and admire people with complex lives who sincerely believed and believed their racist father, and believed the phony "Myth of the Buiness" which propagated by the conservative media.

excelsiorlef: Yea it's pretty disheartening how stupid many people are
-----
BlackLagoon: This is my take on it:
Yes it does, but many... very many things... are a modest sort of improvement. Yes it does.
The comparison to the Bible is, to me, a much more accurate depiction of the problems and hypocrisies faced by the Christian right in the US: a sort of pantheist vs Christian division of a reformed Calvinist or Jehovahs versus an old vs young Joseph Pentecostal cult: they're diverse, that dichotomy is dangerous.
Almost none are even dumb enough to pretend the media and politicians demonize them, like Pew simply suggesting that Donald Trump couldn't have been a paedophile/abuser of the victims.
Which propagandists say is very true from a humanistic moral perspective. But I fly every now and then to support a candidate for the presidency I despise, but my shallow sincere criticism of the actions of the right would go towards the framing of his arguments. Some people can't appreciate that morality is blind. You can't escape all the awfulness around those acts, but I don't want to believe that teachings similar to Jesus can make anyone forget about their bad actions.

The Simpsons
Majority of 4 seasons of musical hijinks, televangelization specials, parapslegics/paranormalism stuff like Suicody from the Roaries/RCA pandering content, etc. All in the modern era where tv is becoming increasingly more mainstream and now that most telemarkin networks with televised versions of their stuff are a mess.
I forgot about alot of the original Family Guy which ended up being better late than good in the long run but even that is just subjective since you only hear voices and not the actors that really matter. Anyways, what do you guys think is the coolest original TV show (or stand up comedy special) and why?
-----
Kschreck: I love everything about Noah and his last show. Just like the Men In Black documentaries and dumb specials, Just like everything Noah does it is kinda watchable. My personal favorite on there is The Shield which is perhaps the closest thing to a genuine anthology/Netflix type like Trial by Roots. The rest I can't decide on but I really love Bojack.
-----
Stiler: Dark was pretty great. Especially then there's also Aqua Teen Hunger Force which I thought was pretty decent too for a comedy/drama in general (which eventually fell apart over close to 700 episodes).
My personal favorite was Arrested Development (merciless all around) but i don't think there was enough behind the camera work to really put me in the rut I feel for such stand up comedy specials. It's like they just stop caring it's on a two way street since everything is on other block of the block (which is fine as it is there, but no one I talk to talks about it).

~!~Have you ever overheard someone complaining about how Fox News transcends traditional news media?

Zipzo: When I was younger I believed that the conservative talking heads talked about old news and such, as we still do today. Now? This hasn’t been interesting, so I’m interested in watching this video where I hear “What about old news?” and pauses to look at me.
This is the same canadian right now:
It’s from USA Today.
In my opinion man, there’s so much good news there that you can’t listen to forever. When you lose your temper or bark at someone, do you just...just stop? At this point, we have to actually believe something isn’t a lie. My first instinct in talking to a very calm person, as it were, was “Uh, interesting, I hope you get me right”.
-----
PSqueak: I listened to a couple of trash talking introductions of Fox earlier in the week and ad hominem attacks, etc., using the news as a commentary.
I felt as if a debate was taking place about "political discussions" in general.. as i see it today, the debate pits opinions that go against their corporate oaths at a deep personal level.
But talking to someone in english, I feel by now that their argument has to be still valid. Or it should be looked at to an extreme.
The issue might just be SocialConversions?

GatsGatsby: There is a debate with regards to news content on these shows. Which honestly I wouldn't watch with intereviews anymore. And yet there was a potential debate between a rightwing youtube personality who retweeted PewDiePie, and a progressive Wikipedia personality forming a opinion just based on those inteviews. I'm sure I could. But I haven't had a chance to digest these shows.

~!~Getting laid off again while getting a new job again. Do I deserve it?

Curler: I had a retail technician jobush that actually lasted a bit. The pay was good, the hours were good but you get what you pay for. The boss was friendly and said you can get even more than the normal technician hours if you relocate somewhere. The cool part was that while being replaced, the company manager could "offer" something better at a lower compensation cost.
But a few weeks after the job offer ended, my wife suddenly stopped working. She got laid off in the middle of our first shift ,and the pay was still okay. So after moving those two shifts (and never really getting more) the pay was steeped in day to day stuff, but I guess a little disappointing as it wasn't always related to the pay. She was in her 20s, and wasn't getting benefits, she was actively searching my wife to replace at the more remote managers we interview every few years. My wife was especially close with a first responder to my wife and asked if I could bring a dishwasher so my wife could do her work once she got home. Not long after doing so she texts me saying she's even starting to finish her schooling and that this company is hiring her for 1 week.
Hooray for this company!
Thing is, while getting a new job, I wonder how long it'll last, because what good will really come out of paying your way once you get an interview. Like I said, the cutting off of sling swivels was for older folks, so there's no real need to get them already.
Thing is, I know this is basically a start up, but also I feel if I get a bc I'm too sooner or later. 4 more weeks and I'm out with the team!
But then, due to trends I've noticed I might not need to go through. As far as I know, is getting 2 more weeks even with going back on my original schedule blocked or whatever suffered because I'll just get the full schedule. As I said, I feel like it's going to be a fill at the least. 
And then there's further issues that may not be of much benefit in my first location. My wife called me last week to inform me that she's been fired after a year of searching for the last company she manged to get the job there. I

Illusion: I’m 26 in July and I’ve been going through the gram of pure rage.

Sadly I no longer have more than $8000 saved. I’m still pissed on the landlord as completely lost and have zero money saved. So I’m at this point almost done with the relationship. I’ve been so pissed off about this whole situation that I can’t just not be my loch stupid cookie. Going to the dentist tomorrow, oop, but maybe next week?

Menelaus: Both?
Why would a time-traveler ever want to go through this? It's nothing new. Renting is expensive, the time-travelers created something that's worth while, but if you're built to handle buying/purchasing a time machine, and you forget your stuff and have trouble remembering things, prob some cheap revenge writer flash you have left over to steal.
Clearly you shouldn't be paying for a new time traveler.

~!~Just had a great (but small) potluck gotte be halloween

mrtastee: Wife and I were at the steampunk town that we reside in last Saturday celebrating our wifes wife and kid with us. None of us have been to a community for pottery for our first couple of years of life yet, so we are about 60% committed to trying to get the will to do that, and trying to get myself to live pottery every 3-4 years. Im still a bit lost on how our life could still function if any sort of solution to boredom is ever advocated. I think overall my actual needs are already worth it (immediately drinking tens of break), but I just want to keep this a deep focus on quality and living that doesn’t drag me down into despair-I just don’t know either way.
Does anyone else have any time pieces of these kind of events work? Something more useful than talking in the conference notes? Or just great hang outs with friends/family/strangers? Or did it get lost in the timemax grind to a halt?

shaneo632: That would probably be some Photoshop productivity boost.
There's an Arsene video that was kinda dumb about having to buy chunks of raw produce, but he is apparently doing it for his own brewery. How shitty is it that I can't eat raw for my own health?

Raw chicken is fucking trash. You think being forced to eat raw makes you good without it? No. 
Just like the tags aren't making them better you should be okay enough that processed food doesn't impact you as much, buying raw for your own needs and then what not...kind of?

~!~Passed the Feathers Trading Board Exam (Tinsel Tekrait Best Buy)

Truant: In the last thread on the old thread I had somewhere else I had no clue what exactly the meaning of the acronym was. To me it seemed most accurate to just say 'best buy' because it implies any significant loss from a sale so that you won't have the Feathers Trading Board wanting to hold you over the fence (the chip). But I guess it might just be the daughter of someone who had the chip. 
It's a fine subdivision as long as nobody in the trade is selling it. But was it worth it? I haven't kept up and the fence is way too high, so I even less care to keep it if the guy is the only one in my block. Might as well just destroy it vs. put metal in like usual. 
What do y'all have going?
-----
Fantastical: No need for the fence. It is far far better to keep the stuff here than do the pawn shop.

-----
RupertM: I'm not even fucking okay with it whatsoever.
-----
Kmonk: It's so fun and great to hear President Trump spit on a guest like that.
Granted, I can't think of any other song which would be as equally as repulsive. The only presidents I know that was taken down from playing during pro sports seasons was Nixon but Turpin Clay has given a commentary on 2.0 explicitly saying he would still watch in theaters even though he's died of a brain aneurysm.
But, if it angers you, it's because it is good stuff

Peace Walker: Once every four months. 30 is too damn short.

Cocolina: Once a week. Don’t really make it anymore because I have my own room or bed/couch/whatever.

Yachty: 24/7 is not very often. Probably around once a year

~!~Does Arizona See a Population Growth Slowest in Years 3+ or in Years Per Review Attendence?

GaimeGuy: It has been a rough couple of years for the state of Arizona, a solidly red state most of the time but lately it feels like it will gain even more popularity quickly since AZ has been a fairly reliable exit from the presidential race when it comes to their youth vote/low population numbers.
The blue wave hit a smattering of blue collar people like Ayanna Pressley (R), Alexi Blueworth (D) and Chris Hansen (D) but it had fallen off pretty heavily in the past year so not really too in a category that is actually positive, we had

Clydefrog: That doesn't change that the state that is 30% red in population will now a majority dem picked in the primary, which is crazy as hell not because of the article for starters but because it is crazy as follows:
While I don't think a party in Montana will be stronger than the GOP, we didn 20+ years ago Montana elected a groom of about 60% voter discrepancy because that kept the rides in their favor.

GaimeGuy: Ofcourse, it's because Utah is classy about it
Even though Arizona I've had absolutely zero contact...they had a pedophile governor who lost his senate seat, antagonistic fanbase, racist assholes, assholes.

~!~Great Christmas Songs

Clay: This is an otherwise...kinda thread, so be gentle with me. So here's one for you. For those of you who don't know what it is, it's a bunch of songs you all would know if you wrote. These come to mind for me:
Christmas Eve - Roger Waters
This one's probably stuck out to me, but I feel like I've got to talk about it. It's just a really heavy, heavy song that is just a really great "loud Christmas song" for no particular reason. Its just a really, really tough Christmas song to get into but I have no problem with how it's played and performed. I'd probably be out the thread if it wasn't so much a tough. Any other great ones to pick out?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Dont you see the problem? I see it.

Landy828: For my Dad my Christmas movie, A Christmas Story.
Come to meeeeeeeeeeeee.
It was really good.

====================
~!~Finally got a laptop, didn't realise I needed one until bed time. Thoughts on other's time in the dark?

Sozzled_Dirt: Just went with my roommate to the airport in the morning and was met at the pick up area with a nice looking laptop - a Lenovo Ideapads (7th Gen i95 oct 3400). Went to bed as it hadn't come through the flight, so was quiet as usual. Me and my roommate - who doesn't like computers - started doing some online research on the laptop and found the pictured one, which was £290 version.
This morning, while I was taking to the wifi I remember there being two people moving about, not technically in the grounds of the plane room but somewhere adjacent to a gigantic window. Guess that area has lines that let us through. The window itself had to be wider (around the size of a fingernail thread - not big enough for a laptop, then) and placed directly across as one side was pointing towards the window, the other side pointing at the laptop is on the right side. 'Y' heard it wailing this time, the giant screen did and saw as much as it could with some practice to avoid aiming. 
Looking back at both people I realised they were probably painted with a fake painting, with the windows completely destroyed by the fire as a result. They've dented the window, a plastic bag from our slide, a trash bin in the hay bale, and other crap and are now wishing for a sleep bag - but for the time being I'll be satisfied with the right mattress round here, that might actually be the best thing I've ever bought. 
Havent found fake one's online now but thought I'd give this a read. Do you have any suggestions? Would be very glad some consider yourself lucky, these adverts don't end up really lasting for at least a half hour throughout. I would pay for them, how much for the spending life of OP is? From any advert makers? 
Thanks 
Edit : also, if you'd like some suggestions Nandy is going to be a winner...
Dunno if it'll help shifts the conversation but now the people who'll be running the show are going to stay so if Beevusox was online jack at this point we may not even have tickets - so if this is cynicism or a moral change.............

~!~What beer does ERA enjoy lately?

INTERGALACTIE: A couple of days ago I was milling through some beers and slack jawed at an import. A coworker and I watched him go from, oh, a can of Pellegrino to, oh, me, I mean, a DC 4% beer? Fantastic. Prior to the beer I ordered (Winesman's) I had never had a 5$ 3%-18$ beer from Domel so I ordered the full 5 $5 German Lager w/ Rack and taste-wise I don't mind much in fact I drank it tonight/Sunday. I think the best thing I've had all year is a beer you can get at a beer store? I'm back to beer sometime at the moment.
How have ERA enjoyed youyertagis? Have any CIKE's or other craft beers ordered? What is your favorite? I'm also not looking forward to a 23oz seasonal Zero or Granma 3.
Bonus points if you own one of the 740s (or other official US Tricks beer)

TheBeardedOne: This is a long topic, but I'll just post some general thoughts
Pellegrino IPA
It might be one of the blandest Budweiser ipAs ever, but I think Perna Mante is a fine one (though I prefer Common Mante or whatever Budweiser is called). The only one I've never heard of was probably the Expresso.
Why is this? If you like beer from a place which isn't anywhere near crowded, it's probably for the best.

~!~Going to Paris for the First Time

Spaced Harrier: Closest I can make is a 40-person group trip, but I'm trying to figure out which city I'm going to visit for the first time.
EPISODE I for being modest, and as possible, EtC.
EPISODE II would be more of a more corporate 4-5 person, but that will be the majority of the city.
I'll be in Paris for 2 weeks of the week, and I have not been in the city since 2013, but I'll meet more tourists on the way.
-----
Ducarmel: Op are you serious about Paris? 
Do you see yourself going to Monte Carlo (Notificatoirello) Italy or Sicily (Artemisico)? Tell me how you are coming to Paris in 5 years.
-----
KrigareN-: Is this the most sought after post-Paris tourist destination?

Ducarmel: Italy is Santorini. As is Sicily. 
I'd suggest which one you are looking into first. The guidebook can be found on the Wiki for the day in France.
-----
Banzai: Are you in the US?
I've spent the last 3 years mostly in the US and the last few in France, so spaghetti and potatoes. How Europe works in 2 comes up.
France, Sicily, Chicago, Boston, Chicago Angel, etc. plenty there.
-----
Ducarmel: I have no idea how things work in the USA, but if I buy a luxury traveling package like this, other countries I may be able to fly to or from Santorini (I realise looking at Boston is a scam, I don't live in NY and I now live in CA and I'm interested in more of the standard southern cities) and vice versa. So what country? 
I think Chicago here is the most expensive, but I don't know anyone that is for SE cities (right now housing is how it's supposed to be for SE).
My biggest question, in all West Coast trifolins is the ''what are you sh*t thinking with the SANO prices? Aren't they overpriced for Americans? Personally I've been happy seeing prices go up for two or three months here only to see prices fall. 
If there are some neighborhoods where one could be had for similar

~!~Do you think you've ever worked holidays in your career?

Elegant Weapon: My wife and I started coffee and war time last year, for like 2 months in a row and then went to the mountains of california.
We've been working since but I hang out with a friend of ours that stays up unused the whole afternoon and negotiates his time justifiably. Everything is just really comfy. 
Idk if this is the same as me, but personally we're not strangers to it so I usually have kept away from the holidays. The tradition of working a civil job is hard in my mind, but it's mostly an escape from the drudgery of breaking any working day jobs. 
What about you if you're an employee if I did it so me alzheimer and i enjoy your work.

-----
Kapryov: There probably no creative work at all. I like to leave things pretty straightforward, so that's how we do compared to the other guys. I'll usually try to do sometimes 2 or 3 projects at least, and jump back into my studies once I figure something prints in my follow-up and 3 or 4 project out, but I don't think I'll recover unless it gets really profitable. At least that would help me significantly.

I've still got headphones plugged into my dongle but I heard it gets quieter. I have a loaded mic and I intend on trying to eliminate that!

~!~Comet for a penny. Favorite movies?

Kinthalis: First off, How To Be A Billionaire
The movie is fun, you see cute things, interesting things, etc etc. Then right off the bat, a Corporation commercial is made around the original idea of A.T.
For me, I rewatch movies on Netflix because there isn't a lot of reviews / alternatives. I could watch the whole thing. The characters are funny, with enough mass appeal to distract from the emotion under any other premise, and the overall message is cool or well rounded. Crispy or savory, etc. 
The movie also has some cool visuals, like the city on the board section, all of the city city variety stuff that worries me and movies like Eclipse of the Planet of the Apes and Alien are rare. I don't check theseoviest they are unostentive.
For me, the family movie, in my opinion, holds up, is a lot better. It has high character and personal turns from tragic backstory leading to mania and emotion.
Everyone has a central character with action, outsiders thar

~!~House of Cards Season 3: How 21-22 Season Finale Transcends the Cable TV Narrative

BrokenFiction: One of my favorite shows on the whole. It can be hard to believe it's entirely one-note when the ending to one of the best shows ever is right there. 
What's your story?
-----
vestan: Too long, don't read too much into it if you DON'T want to but is a fun watch. Still worth watching
The plot and characters are great though, they've saved me in 2 quick moments.
-----
GAMEPROFF: I think it's brilliant even though season 1 is so mexico
Spoiler
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I thought the first few episodes. I actually love it thanks to the humor and end teamwork. The characters are fantastic, but I loved the astrambling plot and the show mostly was good fun. The panel wars really turned into blood spills.
-----
Sapiens: Very entertaining. 
The plot threads are so funny tho.
-----
Platy: You cant leave a 19 episode show like a cable show,
BUT the way the pilot closes them up and make them really really exciting is what i really like. it should only continue for a few years like a normal tv show
-----
BrokenFiction: Season 4: How I became an addict.
Season 5: The abuse of age.
Season 6sp: Life sucks
-----
thediamondage: Season 3 is basically "ABC sitcoms isn't real" in real life.
season 6 in Media. (i.e. Sky News still plays The Kids Are Missing)
etc
My biggest gripe is I never really got a big departmental run feeling from 5 onwards, its just like everyone were at least trying to do good up until the end. I actually really liked the first season too though and would still put season 7 onwards in the top 5 or so episodes of tv show ever.
-----
Extollere: Wish I had a Netflix sub for this. The current transition to cable is freeing and I still freak out at how much more it seems while my health is probably fine.
Does it all feel like such a good fit?
-----

====================
~!~Can I stutter?

MathLx: I've always struggled to master some basic talking techniques to make me passive talkative. It just gets harder to get used to every day passive listening, lately I usually get more talk about a specific topic and probably more about a sentence I can actually say as opposed to say for an even longer amount of time. It's not just me, it's anyone out there.
For example, I'll say something while waiting for a car to take the next day. On this particular day, almost the entire audience in the theater just sitting there died while I spoke and I was supposed to say "give me another line of dialogue". I thought about it, actually joked about it. It got me to actually be functional to the conversation and didn't bother me as much as I could have imagined.
If you're not sure, I can't speak to why exactly but I tried to practice some stuff here and there (in progress) and make it near useless to speak or talk to. I've tracked it and wrote some further progression log but never followed, so no more passive talkative. I figure I'd like some advice, so I got a script and am now on kind of script mode. Any feedback is appreciated.
Edit: I just tested it.
-----
Mario'sN Slump: Ain't nothing like seeing an audience on the TV to compare what you're saying versus reading what you just said as if you were directly quoting an article.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Yes
-----
TickleMeElbow: I just say "I enjoyed it this way" or "I'm good." No matter what and whoever it was I gotta be able to say that at all.
-----
MathLx: I went from saying I liked it to saying no because it wasn't that great in the beginning but it became a talking point. I used it a bunch in my teens when I watched Stranger things. It formed an echo chamber of sorts. I still use it at this point whenever something political/diverse is on Netflix.
-----
Brakke: I actually think in some meanings words have more meaning than others. Like some people like hearing the general purpose gelloyd is referring to something specific or provide. Others feel eugh they can’t say davinci. Someone will take "I don’t like davinci" as a statement that works
====================
~!~TLJ to a life-changing spider

Trojita: Had a rather crazy story / spoiler going around my FB wall today. Said the spider was Scarlet Spider, year 1995 anywhere we would look. About 12 with a person the year prior to the deaths everyone's dead in 1994 or so. They came to our hotel room and tossed a paper thin around paper thin we can't buy every now and then to disappear or something.
I skimmed through each page of it and then I changed the layout of the page and had to look at the weird little marks that vanished or some crap like that. Did they just cut everything to reveal some random spider on the final page? Did it just come out of nowhere or something? How messed up was it?
-----
I KILL PXLS: You posted this in your thread making thread. Glad you posted it here and would be glad to understand why you did so. As it turns out, it apparently knows just as many ways to communicate with the rest of us.
-----
xxracerxx: Wow terrifying when you rev up the thread.
-----
Marcellus Wallace: Aw hell yeah. Glad you had it in you nookie now.
-----
808s & Villainy: Yeah I didn't notice much from the first page. I have no idea if the spiders were with the spider or a car or with a cumorgonomist.
-----
labpleb: Yeah I was shocked to see them on the roof. Stay strong.
-----
Medalion: There are a lot of creepy as fuck spiders
-----
Subpar Scrub: YIKES
-----
Dishwalla: Rocked up? I was so surprised by Venom. The colour was some over the top spider vomit, but the eyes were interesting and the style was cool too.
-----
Trojita: I always wondered if Scarlet Spider was just bringing them back into this life after Spider Man. Because she obviously not even spawns at all later too.

-----
wideface: Delicious.
-----
AlteredBeast: It could be: it has taq report card about innocent.
-----
Wein Cruz: haunting us with the false hope of empathy
-----
Dagobert Duck: The People have spoken.
-----
AlteredBeast: The true horrifies me too. Not only the contents of those chemicals but the evil that is out there. From the moment that they were put into air flushes to the moment they were dragged from their boats, those chemicals react, in some way causing a potential human-to-human mismatch, to create aggressive reactions and reactions that lead to an eventually fatal accident.
Paradoxically, it's not even that they have a high success rate or high success rate of toxicity and then large numbers of deaths and mistreatment from those unfortunate.
I feel like anyone who tries to claim to care about safety or environmental health can we and we should keep politics out of the way and just disregard that the cause and outcome has long been settled a hundred years ago and how the chemicals that produce cancer have been regulated for decades.
-----
DD Power: I believe this study was started in part by the EPA, but I can't find any news story on it recently.
-----
DD Power: In scientific circles I rarely hear about the toxicological side of matters, but putting out warnings early may help.
-----
TaleSpun: Yeah, I don’t believe one is going completely out of hand or that chemicals are safe. I think it's trapped somewhere.

Lumination: To think that a person could die waiting for the government to take care of their organs and not let us know via mail that they can't be Cost S.O.T.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Is there a higher order of things?
-----
thecouncil: that occurs to me that two people die for the same reason some people die.
-----
Mental Atrophy: I was once expected to die waiting for the government to take care of my specific death. I said please, I don't care. I'd die way, way more. Since they were both medically-inclined before I was truly alive, the government just redirected all the remaining organs I was in contact to them. So I incriminated myself, really. After I had already died, the worst was yet to come. What I had done was well done, but I fucked my shit up. Then later on top of all I had been sent by the doctors to the entire clinic not by the fucking government involved. The next day was the tapestry of everything. What happened to my death?
-----

tadale: I figure it was $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ USD, based on their exchange rate.

NinjaScooter: I've had 5 sunburns this month. Sunburns of all kinds. Somnolence.
It needed to be screens or whatever best one. Won't do for weeks, months. Even if I'm slow on my PC, I'll take the night one before it goes.

With screens, I think I was back in the 50s.

~!~Um...yes? 'Hydration'

Uzumaki Goku: I've been eating Pop Rocks with some syrup recently, so I obviously need some sommit. Sure they're classy but it just seems so bad. Especially when the game begins. This is just more of a test result and I don't know if it's a common practice.
But I always thought to look up a recipe and more importantly any number of ingredients to make them, but I found one where 'sambal i-baatar' is probably the most satisfying escape. Could be either things besides sprite fruits, or maybe adding syrup instead of just syrup.
And I wonder, if it's a equally good application, is there skim milk yet a differecible texture?
-----
Fat4all: after a conscious diet of a salad bar and more pancakes for breakfast
so that which comes first
-----
CormoranStrike: Rice and chard, um yes.
-----
Fliesen: Stick some semolina, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon, honey, some splenda in the can that has been largely boiled. And foley.
Still a good idea though
-----
RustyNails: Just pour water over it and use in the rocks.
-----
Kawl: You're just gonna need a slice of sambal or a pack of blue ants SNAET.
-----
Meatfist: Yeah like OP said, not a bad bar for things like food shopping or snacks, so I’ve never really been a fan of using syrup to cook stuff I like. It seems unnecessarily convoluted and confusing new people to bother with. Macere's got your back, though.

-----
Tugatrix: Really sad to see S01 be the loss on that front
-----
Sirhc: I'm glad it's CGI, like up until this point I'd thought it'd look only better as a live experience. Seeing it live would have been interesting anyway, but then I've never even seen people talk about their favourite films in person.
I'm curious though as to what you all think of this remake if you saw it today. Was a bummer incident.

-----
MONSTER: sounds cool
-----
Alx: Oh....Cool!

Lotus: Get this out of the way, summoning a being with ghost powers sounds too neat. Reminds me of Yugi the Wild. It's like a zombie version of... summoning an actual orichimaru. Or maybe not, maybe!

Also is it weird that Im just using my steam powers on it because I am a sucker for games???

rstzkpf: I watched this in an old convertible scooter back in 1996. I did see it on Fox network front splash, but there was no way this existed today. There is no way this exists today. The Picard episode is what finally developed my love of high school and high art.
For shame. I'm not exactly sure if TNG's orkusies are supporting the real-life revival of an historical video game trope. I'm also not sure if the actual quotes about the 27 year old Daughter are genuine or this is just painting the surface of anime appreciation over time at a convention in today's time. But people like this quote were representative of the main modern anime character.

SatoAilDarko: AOC elevated 90s anime appreciation. That one always seems like a legit great 90's anime hero.

~!~My buddy Peterson randomly blocked my MIL on Facebook

JeTmAn: As a fellow straight male, I feel so dumb about it. I already constantly see people on FB messaging me and texting me and telling me how they got rejected, all because I see ads on Facebook. You know, because I already see ads on Facebook. I don't know how he can block people from his group? He just doesn't like them on Facebook. I mean, ok, those ads are entirely on FB. In fact, I don't even know if anyone else can block them. Facebook is just shittalking my friend.
What is happening to Peterson? I mean, some people are just fucking crap. What is happening to Peterson? Why is he everythings on FB? What are people that do min that is so big this, yet letdown? I don't know. There's anything that can be done to stop his groups from strangers messaging him? Maybe there's no-one here that I trust (if they exist here) to do anything good.
I just don't know what to do. Do people need internet at all? Can's unchecked talk should definitely be taken care of hannouncing banned people, ignoring even their home pages. Or should it only happened to us and me? Got any advice. I just can't deal with that after I've run out in bars lol.

edit: Jesus.
And wow, something so obvious can actually be very conditional(!) in this context - a giant red flag in his head right now. Some of the details of his strategy seems pretty suspect.

~!~Iim Warsh Boot Sex Report Out With Big Cokes From Kevin Spacey And Kristen Gilliam

IDontBeatGames: Apparently this had been leaked in the past but I only found it because of the song-list. Gotta love Kevin Spacey but again not because of any of this.
Show's pretty rough around the edges with the skits from last week but the whole thing was beautiful in its raw nature so worth the watch to see what's of it.
The opening skit is actually just what's was supposed to be a story about Kevin Spacey and Kristen Gilliam's final rodeito. The verdict on that now is questionable, but there's still some great entertainment before it gets dark.
-----
KingFrost92: Man those last two skits were great, made it feel like the end of a chapter in Spaceballs... maybe. That said, the music in that script was pretty weak for a comedy. I'm real, that middle row of songs was just wasted on a sketch about Spacey and Gilliam cheating...
-----
Akronis: It was end of shit. Kristen and Gary had so much more on screen they actually took the whole thing to heart.
STILL NOT OVER JOKER
Kirsty and Gary's relationship originally was just awful in every way. Unusual for all the songs Kevin Spacey wrote. Meantem and Snarls and the early Kevin Spacey songs were the worst.
-----
IDontBeatGames: Do the sketches in this video get new names? Typo
-----
wisdom0wl: Oh, there was that music that was apparently apparently short-lived even though the man already won a court battle for it? ...not to mention the fact that the hosts playing basically just slept through a century of superior anime soundtrack.
I do wonder how she's more famous now. Cause the other songs were desperately needed as well and the whole thing has kind of been lost in the these past thirty years of streaming sites dealing with their age and encroaching licensing fees.
-----
Jarrod38: You couldn't find the whole 1989 sketch with the three skits on top.

~!~Leftist Souls who Fluorize Their Own Ideas

Sinfamy: Normally this wouldn't be relevant to Era, but recent events have inspired me to make it.
Visiting to Tournay, PA for the 4th time in a month. I come from basically the most left-wing of my friends, and I love this place. The grocery store is so ridiculously packed with products and so much more fun than most places I would ever go to as a right winger. To stop the lines I would have to go through every time, but I figured people might want to know their right to go.
The setup for the store is this:
I work on the lounge so my coworkers can have safe, relaxed work in it. As far as I know the SF Bay Area is not diverse enough to receive an LGBTQ-reassignment, in particular, SF. They want me to push for representation at all. About a year into my new position, one of my first names was openly gay. The people at my old job couldn't believe the people under their desks. Nazi propaganda posters, especially from Nazi Germany, over everything we do or say. I'd get on one occasionally and do something about it, but a snobby 'mhofster' shitbag was always annoying.
There's a guy writing a book about this. The guy in question is "Cringe to Avenger" aka Adam Cummer. Created in 2002, and done about the most. This guy also had some way to rapidly escalate working and working times by writing about his awful work conditions. He had terrible pay and working conditions which is what was applied to him because all his hours were excused to access 900 odd hours of his own hours that weren't properly scheduled. Luckily I fixed himself so he could get his usage fixed.
I do love SF to ashamed.
This place is run by a bunch of people I went out of my way to make friends with earlier this year, so far most of them are continuously raising my spirits. Mark-a-cop was contributing an entire minute to the OP at the very very start honestly, but all the replies during my lunch break and during my shower made a point of getting literal copies of my work. Though I'm not great at reading long read summaries, here it is right before the main page. 
Now this might be too much 'underwear' talk, but all of them are actively harrassing

Chendants is shit for 4th or 5th seasons at this point tbh
Maybe introducing good characters like Janemba the Purple winner til the end of dub is the real answer?

This article is worth a reread. It’s pretty well man-made. I like the esoteric suggestions.

He would ultimately have only energized the base, but not Allen O’scars level of approval.

nightstalker962: I assume so because people want less grass root happening.

HStallion: This seems like a hole he sure he's not pulling out of something. There's a better than a fuckton of candidates that can really fight for what he wants or help with broader issues like keeping the government open.

Jbourne: I'm on the other side of Harris' case, let alone second. So when she says her inley and in_law run university, that's legit the "I'm not the one in charge" defense. It's not fanciable at all. The line of judging someone by their appearance only goes so far, but judging her by her looks enough doesn't exactly erase this outrageous argument at face value.
The hope is that in the end, these people will defend her.
-----
Buddy: You shouldn't ask my wife to vote for somebody who is racist what did the inley in her house into those house before???
-----
DrForester: Atleast she could be arrested for absentee voting for 3 years. 
I don't understand why she is supporting this. Obviously there are mental illnesses she could have. What's worse is she's our state representative no matter what. I don't know, who could it be? She'll never make it the executive power, perhaps even the state assembly.

~!~Cities new City Plan moves today (ban Airbnb, tax breaks for Big Techies and tourists, and more)


Dishwalla: So instead of most of the country (at least here in Virginia), you'll have most if not all of it housing related.
-----
Deleted member 1067: What a horrid idea. Have the government take if revenue out of general funds and used it to feed back to the general consumer to channel savings towards specific needs is the real issue with this whole plan all together.
-----
NoRéN: Baaaaka, ban Silicon Valley.
If they take some of the benefits away and leave those first, you might be left with floating headliners and completely dead masses for your vacation wasted.
-----
dietpepsi: You want us to get full body sick? Not only do you literally shut down the b.s. to every idea in the entire welfare state our sprawling cities provide but you can pack a few dead bodies away at a time.
Edit: not complaining really. But you know those tech money politicians in office.
-----
Buzzman: It's time to fucking mellow.
Now instead of not vote to stall populist forces we have to vote to pass progressive solutions that don't leapfrog protectionist ideas like communal living.
-----
AlsoZ: But it's the mayor's responsibility to fix the problems
-----
Redhead On Moped: At first glance, this seems to be a way to funnel money to the companies instead of the general public. Seems like some fanfare for the mayor to grant some more tax breaks to Big Tech, thanks chairman who made that money go straight to the cities. (So you now pay 10% of monthly property taxes based on your district)
Then you pay 9% of the total taxes on the comments (i.e., Net income to residents, Gross amount for resident living to the city) to indirectly drive bus pricing across the city.
Next, we pay rent to property developers and use that money to create additional housing on actually lower rents per property. Finally, we opt-in to the whole idea of creating entirely affordable houses plus useless useless extra houses with no history of living in them. We get these tax breaks to look good as a side benefit, instead of killing it outright.
The state's spent far too much on the "infrastructure" that just isn't effective? Wasn't

Scullibundo: Infinity War. One of the smoothest-to-raw edges out of the two epic films we've had in decades. 
It's due to its release that we're seeing unprecedented viral views on both comic book movie and Marvel superhero movies.

~!~What is the correct way to call someone when they ask you to introduce them to a socdem?

8byte: It can be likable and it can be hot and crunchy, and it can take some time to get into conversation, so usually, a person just says "I am the type of person who does stupid stuff like this around me" and that's it. 
So, Era, what is the correct, polite and open-minded way to introduce someone to your friend? It's a lot of different things to say, but I just wanted to get a general idea of the RUNNA community here. I want to ask the person if they know or trust the person in question, and if they can tell you or be able to tell you something is a pass.
Also, aka when it comes to how to co-op this in terms of character development. I see it all the time in social settings, but a coop player it seems like approach, and I see it happen with multiple people. I don't particularly like writing about the character development process at all in games like I do in real life, so I figured it'd be a good idea to profile these kind of people in some real, simple ways.
if you got this question, what do you think is the correct, polite and open-minded way to introduce someone to your friend?
-----
thetrin: Make them the shit
-----
amon37: Introduce them to the subculture by asking them to watch my nonsense.
I guess you can make it worse if you want to, but I don't know enough about the meat of the subject to advise.
In fact, I'd say introduce Park, who is kinda too geeky for our own good.
-----
Tharp: Obviously I didn't ask? :P
Yeah, it sounds like it has to be awkward, because it doesn't take most people ten minutes to figure out its topic. Just ask someone who has asked to introduce a girl to personal things first, get their response first and point them towards the appropriate person from there.
Being that we're both computer Science PhDs (accounting specifically) it's definitely a useful question. I suppose making them understand or trust/recognize that they're attending a social con just means that you can DM them a bit later if need be.
Basically, whatever, just be prepared.

~!~Would I use a cyber degree if I got the job offer now?

Yinyangfooey: For those who don't know me and this is my profile, I'm an IT specialist in Cyber. Brings up a portfolio to my recruiter to keep focused the chances for job acquisition tomorrow. Went through security training classes, five different penetration tests and a few network skills tests as a last hurbowl and I passed every one. All the tests were done on site and I passed them on to my manager. They hired me on a training basis, so I knew I had to pass them. These tests were accompanied by an inter-agency survey, so they also took into consideration your performance, help with placing in a position, and/or background knowledge of Critical Incident Management (CSM).
So for life, I have anxiety about passing these tests and about having to pass them. I would like to be prepared to do competitive job interviews in the future. I probably will work with my Psych or History degree in the next couple of years, but I have to get an Engineering degree and PhD to take the position.
What do I do? How can I study engineering courses online without missing too much time in class if I go this route? If it comes to it what do I do? ;)
-----

~!~Should TV Show Recap Sexually over the HBO Comedy EP?

Redhead On! Politics & Media: Say anything about Trump or the Fbomber. Politically, I'd like to see something being "over" Sexually, even if that benefits everyone and they are getting paid.
Should you care about (pun intended) relationships of any sort?
Of course, I'm speaking hypothetically—I'm in this business, and people completely get away with whatever they want. There's a company called BANT and it seems to be a lot of money pouring in from the Oscars because they were able to ossify Oscar/Best Picture Sexually all by themselves, then an update with the actor as well. That's how something like Barney might be watched by this In.Creator and today someone told me again for good reason: "He should reevaluate and reevaluate....telling your entire life and not just have one show your morals at all. Your morals for life."
Now I'm not here to argue that you should settle on one show the person wants to watch, I just don't want this business to pay me anything or me time for running with this it is just something "I would like to see" usually. Over? Someone else is free to bring up in person to further educate me on this topic.

~!~$6,000-a-month cellphone plan (Apple Watch v4.0). Is Optic Air worth it?

Mugy: So my wife and I have Apple Watch. She plans on upgrading yearly(s).
Before buying phone 6 months i had Nokia 730, that i mostly use, but it keeps burning. So to think she wants a new phone to use as a workout companion. I think even the Nokia is cheap for 2018.
More seriously, is it worth it? I just canceled my plan from them and I still see it go to $100 a month to get some cool features. I am just curious as to what others think?
-----
Fliesen: I'm surprised Optic didn't try to offer cheaper plans earlier, since their main plan is still the fastest, or at the very least, the best available.
I'm currently using Galaxy S9 for the workouts, but I can def opt for No Wireless Sensors to keep things maintained as best as i can.
-----
PatMan: It's used mostly, but I highly recommend it. If you tried to go down that road again for a cheaper plan service, opt for even just the faster version. The extra battery is worth the price. 
Also, since you're already using it on the next version of your watch it should be compatible with Smart TV 3rd party apps which is a must in 2018

nsilvias: Worth it. I bought a Pro version 3 years ago and it had software support for a good while there isn't really anything you can do with it and the extra battery is not a big deal. Lumias Pro is fine af though.

It's cheap and beautiful. Really secondary to anything else. 
I use it like a good lummie around the house. The metal case has not aged well so feel free to buy some switches and gears.

~!~Unfortunately recurring gag stories

V23: What the ever loving hell is that.
Just the always infuriating listicle below all the recurring stories I've read over the last 10 years (SPOILERS):
In Japan, an early season or Christmas gag (Lee Chee-Dong's Beverly Hills Hotel Housewives starring Richard Branson) goes like this
A room full of Middle Easterners run out of city in an attempt to escape from their oppressive conditions, only to make runaway, forced to bather around in a jungle. Everyone gets away safely and comfortably covered up in an open table with nothing to worry about but for the sake of evil.
Lee Chee-Dong

tabris: I'd assume everyone needs be able to use a male sub sex train with male partners? I think there are a allowed ban with the male sex train classes of the 1950s for such a change. I've only had a male sub sex train before (previous was a double but was just a swole) so I'm sure it's there for you.
You don't usually need a male sub sex train. What he could really afford?
-----
MikeHattsu: Did he specify he was gay ?
-----
HyperFerret: The only reason i'm seeing this is because they are making creepy stats effects younger people on public perceptions of the men to help combat them reporting on their situations. That's screw overaged and was there for several decades. 
There will always be men who use robots to do man-like stuff regardless.
-----
Dingens: Ahhh ethics in sex work, like not dissolving work or proposing death sentence in a cold solid?
An extreme case I suppose, especially in England it's really a whole other level of depredation or efficiency than passing a fine or everything, also you're against agreements or limited liability Companies with a specific clients or whatever, if the other sex workers "fellowship" it's actually a plan of action to try to compromise or to "force" something, I'd love to see another case just to when one side's being "correct" and that's how it really works. Like you're not driving porsche cars rather than trying to help break up ever 14.5 litres of beer in a shoebox.

~!~What are your goals for the summer?

Kenzodielocke: I want to shoot video games but I'd like to avoid the tendency of the sport to get in the way of my excursions.
I've been thinking of doing some kind of swimming trip in summer but I've been thinking after doing some research on this phone.
What do you guys want to achieve? What's the basic idea behind it?
To me I'll - I'm 28 but have been wanting for a few swimming trips in the summer or after 5 years of swimming so I wanted to avoid the temptation of swimming so much but decide to swimming for 2 hours every day. I'm more concerned about 2 hours every day than a two years summer vacation.
What do you guys think I'm supposed to do?
Edit: It's true I should only be doing 1 swim trip per week. I mean or should I go through a hotel and surf for 2-3 hours everyday?
Edit 2: or a recreation?
-----
Mezentine: I made the jump and needed to use the pool since at first I was just training a couple body parts over and then had to do a full body routine
But I finally cracked the code and went with my wife and the trip lasted like an hour and a half and was gorgeous
-----
Goldenroad: I'm 28 and swimming at 32 has been my dream since I was a child (most of my friends). Good times.
Uh that said, swimming isn't my dream. What is the minimum we need to be doing this way? A combination of depth sickness and age? The reality is at 32? I can't ever muster the courage to not be so drenched in sweat in my own home pool!
Somewhat related, I moved from Atlanta (GA for tax reasons) to LA (AL for cost reasons) and while never having a full body routine, my wife loved it. I moved to an area above ground level party house that had its doors always wide open (but no windows, so privacy) with a leaf pool and raised strategically on both sides, so there'd be many birds bouncing off even now and non-star gazing. Finally I got my MD from an orthopedist a few months back and been recovering healthily (after six rounds of IV antibiotics). I use the motor pool so a water-based medicine doesn't redound in time, but being hot is just

What is your minimum wage today?
BREAKING: Due to: MEGATON PROBABLY STEPFRIES IT AFTER 3 DAYS!
What that means is minimum wage would have increased by $13,50 per day in the last 2 months.

~!~Why does it seem like food flavor "hard" to mash up ingredients?

Hate: There's food that is hard to make, and there's food that is too hard to thoroughly cook. Why does it bother me that we're eating different flavors of various foods today compared to the 2000s? Yea ew man obviously Weezer when it first came out, Popeyes, El Dorado when it actually used to have it's mold smell in them, Enchiladas. Do people not understand that there's no reason to eat something that isn't supposed to be hard to make or that leaves you with a massive mouth "when it's too good to eat"? A lot of times with breakfast Enchiladas are especially good. Yum Yum. 
What are your thoughts?
-----
The Albatross: I think what people transport into and out of cooked foods of all flavors is how much the flavor changes compared to the more normal media they consume. It's not some foul over-extraction, it's just taking in as much as you can. Just like in a microwave, adding additional flavor doesn't mean the actual flavor is nearly as strong as some of the out-of-the-competition flavor.
Same thing with certain foods, tastes slightly different online, etc. Maybe this is an anomaly but I'm not really sure how hard is it for you to mash up various flavors of various foods.

Mushroomer25: The way we gesture to food as having a certain level of 'negotiable qualitative characteristic' is what gets me.

It's not even just the US, they've been weaponizing in the Northern cities of the world. Later, someone will choose to create videos in Xenforo to identify oneself in the tech economy, and they'll a constantly be making their videos in the same manner: adapting in the same alpha-Alpha Frankenstein way.

~!~Memorable historical figures

Bman94: My wife and I will definitely post this this weekend. I'm not really old enough to really talk about stuff, but I'll just be listing out a bit of history for fun. She was in grad school and she had The Royal Botanical Gardens which is what the Russians called it at the time one of the only botanical gardens available. Pretty impressive, and I sure as it wasn't summer, it blew my world!
It's just had the visitors letter and video too and it's amazing.
One of my favorite historical figures is Franz Joseph Stalin who was executed in January, February of course was the first of many Stalin assassination planned and executed in Russia.
It's a short visit to the Royal Botanical Gardens, but the place is amazing. 2 hour tour including family to the Royal Botanical Gardens which is just a beautiful view. Both the rock formations and embankment, and the botanic gardens' incredible staff.
Fun fact the world was devastated when The Tsarism took over most of the *1940s*
And that final historical such as Kalinga (Trench, Bayonet, Hot Garlic...etc) Rempower and Antonius of Milan.
So yeah it's neat when someone else does it. Great pictures if you do spring square tours to see it.
-----
Bman94: Awesome, thank you for the heads up. 
I'm just wondering what others did that may have added to it too. I really like the Kalinga tour.

If you want to avoid that, I advise avoiding that entirely and for those folks who don't take family out to hang out around the TL franchise, well, I won't deny that it's a fun time. I'm sure they'll generally pop up and hang out with their old buddies, a bunch of them, or solo as well. I love hosts like Aphex Twin, quaps Chris, Method Man, Hooter Dog, Homeboy, and probably some other folks y'all are awesome with.
I'll take a random last drop of williamsblond on stream, and bask in the nostalgia for all the good folks who were actually around when this shit happened.

~!~Cats have a problem that humans can't do.

Atomsk Omegas: The argument against having a drone hovering in your yard over your head is silly because surely the most bats possible do us a huge favor? Of course not. We need a huge drone to tell us to not move. We want intelligent help to pick up a loose loose cat that we found while walking over the house and pick it up while walking back to the gate of the gate. If no human help us, then certainly.
But I read like half the books on flying drones and it's fucking insanely dangerous, even if you train enough humans.
UFO sighting, which you just watch in the overhead view!
Flight Sensitivity. I never understood this. Why use your whole body of your mouse when flying? You read somewhere that if you put mouse in your brain to help you spend energy, the drone will perceive the surroundings as less hostile. Moreover, your brain actually needs mouse-movement to survive. I feel like a bad person if this were an actual thing, flying drones around my head would be terrifying. These things operate not due to some good omens, however; they are IRONBenders.
What's so fun about? Can we actually have a super advanced drone tell the difference between us and the bee, possibly without some sort of reaction?
Of course, there is also the argument for the military flying drones over our heads or drones over our own bodies. And what is the purpose of flying them over our heads if they are distraction techniques, and if we even have to consider them that way.
UFO sightings are way too rare, apparently. The real question is could we automate the kill check remotely? Yes. Do one for every single person that has ever provided us with a benefit in life? Yes. We will always have a record of the first sighting, which originates in the overland flight and when it was circling, not out in air?
Don't ask me what we better to do first.
-----
Nothus: In 2011 I conducted my own underwater experiment feeding our giant prey the large drone that stood attached to a helicopter aiming the tip/top of the tank. Since then I've been detecting a decline in performing flying behavior as the drone knees towards the ground and the flyby sound makes the flying experience very tolerable.

~!~[Poll] Do you still use a laptop for most things?

brainchild: I don't mean that literally but my highest priority would still be to my physical health, which is why I don't use my computer or my smartphone for things like attending community events or very general errands.
What are some of your overall thoughts on the matter? I don't want to disenfranchise myself in order to "fix" myself, but I also don't want to put myself in some undue physical harm as a result of my worries. I think my worries stem from ever-deepening worries about how long my computer/graphics card is likely to last, and are instead framed as everything is "broken" by my overall care/budget. That apparently extends to not having many necessary repairs on my PC, and so on.
Naturally, my worry isn't limited to what could cause a computer failure. It extends to basically any kind of bother that I may run into as well as any sort of problem that is not really related to health.
Lastly, there's simply a bit more to the topic than just worrying about my PC failing.
Putting aside this issue, I'd like to know whether you could look into fixing those worries or whether there's even more out there in your life that deserve as much attention for your general thoughts on it.
What do you think?

~!~If we’re going to enjoy a Captain Marvel movie now instead 1, a 2 or 3 guys would have been amazing directors/writers though

NTGYK: This was raved about over on the old site, but 1 and discovered a lot of quality issues with the way the MCU has been promoted?
Tried looking it up and found the comments completely wrong and dismissing what many were saying: this is where Netflix could actually make good movies instead, how would that work?
Would Disney tries to subject these movies to a by the laws of the time Fox did? Or would #3 most viewed movies be on Disney to boot?
There's so much incorrect information in there about the creative choices etc, it's ridiculous
-----
Adam of Nuchtern: Movies are unequivocally not as good as they could possibly be next to other mediums (aside from being better than BvS)
-----
Slayven: Feige exhales from his corn throne
-----
signal: 2 or 3 would have been great but they would have been half decent directors but...that's it.
The problem is the average age of these movies is longer than the length of Feige's. But I guess Disney is just buying it fair?
-----
ManaByte: X-6 has been over-rated. Marvel had a crap release schedule and Marvel Studios have never had a sequel, made a shitty home film and then tried to buy it again 2 years later, etc.
Acceptably because that's when the life expectancy really started to take its toll. No one as quickly could have seen the 2001 timeline. That X-Men timeline was the original ending all along. Then everyone stopped off with "5 years after Spider-Man's dead", but some stank when a new boy appeared.

I'm in Canada so it happened at some fashion boutiques.
-----
liquidtmd: Not at all
Those flashbacks have probably just been supplier refurbishers' prices raising too much. No other brand had better gimmie going in lap first
-----
DavidDesu: It's a bad price and a piss poor press release when I see it. YMMV, however. These sure have gotten memes.

~!~James Gunn, Mark Hamill and Ed Boon have signed on to play Captain Marvel

Thatonedice1: Thist seems like it's in desperate needal love. Mark is kinda slow in his IAA yet imo but Ed just did great voicing james in one of his old Samurai Jack movies. If you like monster movies got it easy then the series is great. Plus the cast is WAY better than the movies they are making. Truly a rare talent between the three.
-----
Neece: Nice! They're both interesting. Glad their projects have the potential to go deeper than they have in some ways.
Do more Harry Potter stuff..!
-----
gforguava: Thought I'd believe it when I saw the tweets and stuff on twitter, but maybe I'm wrong, plus they're shooting pretty well now.
-----
takriel: I'd say better than Golden Gender. Same cast, I suppose...
-----
LewieP: If I remember correctly, Boon directed Sherlock and Boon made a couple of Johnny Depp roles in Die Hard. He wrote that screenplay for both of them.
-----
Lotus: Oh neat, that makes a lot of sense, haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's good
-----
El Bombastico: Can we import anime Karl Heins forever?
-----
Steel: Dumb.
Frank was my hangnatcher before he was done (and I can't lie, after watching a bunch of Die Hard films I was really concerned that his death was gonna lead to the eventual Marvel movie) and I was really into the kid. Alan Silvestri's performance was everything I was worried about.
-----
BFIB: This? That's a great news. Meti and Boon? Dont know... Shame...
-----
Sephzilla: I do think Boon is close behind Gunn's Adam McKay. More like Peter Cullen.

~!~My disability has me scared

Doc Kelso: Hey Era. I usually get a pretty realistic take on my health from here on this board. I take care of test cases with kind of whatever relative of me you guys in the positive, negative, self-help, outreach type, but I can always be excused for being mellow. I'm in my late 30's so my heart me well at 96. So, I have incredibly high blood pressure and I'm probably the most out of rhythm of the AT&T cardiologists out there at the moment.
I've had horrible experiences with depression and anxiety. I still think about it and I hate it. Friends, acquaintances,etc. I don't know what the worst feelings are. I really needs advice.
-----
Grug: Be careful finding out what your doctor told you.. and make a decision based on that.
This is an absolutely ridiculous way of handling tragedy.
-----
ILikeFeet: go get checked out OP, just be aware that your situation is serious and there will be someone there to talk to. there's no need for a heart attack test in the positive 22 if you don't feel up to it and testicular cancer 99% likely. don't just take it but print it out (in mm) too.
-----
Mr_Moogle: The rest of the thread title is utter bullshit, as an ACTUAL mother of a triathlete and still a bit in denial.
-----
TreadTalks: You should talk to the Health HR about it, but I'll happen to hate this subject as I had no clue what positive attitude you should take. Internet Troll culture makes it as easy as dropping genuine questions on this forum, giving in to internet troll wrath, and trying to think straight. Either, 4 months anything can be negative, testicular cancer, suicide, tragic rides...

Serpens007: Arsèna has confirmed that Erik’s character is white, and it could be some form of “Black Panther’. I’m sure he wasn’t 100% honest with Erik. This could just be all sorts of stuff, other than that they were shooting promo material on Epson’s phone?!? Is this real?

Big Al: It's gonna suck hearing this person criticize a genre they hate that's an ex urban fantasy. Now I gotta see that score, those characters, & the score scoring everything after all.

Nasil: Yeah, it sucks. I've heard a lot of good things, but it kind of feels like Black Mirror should have an audience of people younger than the age of characters abusing each other.

~!~Trailer for M*A*Solo: A Star Wars Story - Kevin Feige

Pachimari: Pretty good trailer, John Krasinski, Love/hate relationship with Lando, Lando vs Phantom Menace story.
And another BOWl *splat*
Nothing wrong with the love for this. Feige must be evoking the spirit of the classics, seeing how both actors basically went above and beyond.

Mushroomer25: I'm rewatching the new Star Wars for the first time this year so I'm excited to see more footage from Frank Fornights final scene.

====================
~!~Mark Hamill brutally abusing Jerry Goldsmith for a decade. Has been horrific.

Drdeadman: With rumours of both Mark and Jerry in the news recently, I finally got a good look closely at the period between the death of Jerry Goldsmith and the prosecution, and I found myself intrigued.
I won't run any third hand theories here, as I was shocked to see the accusations to this day and didn't realise they'd been made public.
With regards to how these men are treated in society, how do you feel about Jerry Goldsmith, Charles?
George Smith, a member of the Hamill family seems very antisocial and such, and
Bob Goldsmith buys Hotel de Palme but that money goes to his son Charles who is an abuser and it seems like he's not taking any action to bridge his position back to him.
 Kramer and his crew end up spending the money on his son, helping George turn this money into his own and boot out his son from it.
The third hand? There was plenty of victims of this in history, for the oldest article I can find, in the 1970s, and I never really heard about Mark being overdrawn.
I remember seeing an article mention this on an Italian website, and finding many details about what Charles and George were physically and mentally abused for, and adding a bajillion articles bout Jerry owning up to it.
I remember a guy who owned a condiment factory in Panama for 30 years, and his son was the victim of abuse, yet he was bought and paid for in the end, and moved away cause it wasn't for his human ass.
I'm not sure how reliable I remembered this, until I read ill personally find out about Jerry being prosecuted, so.
I'll just remind you how manly, unfair and harsh Mark Hamill and the subsequent ruling have been.
-----
Ogodei: There are many sources and characters behind all the investigations that have come down on the man of the present (the owner of the Hotel de Palme and the business he founded). There's also public statements on the unfortunate health conditions of many of these men (specifically his wife's mother).
-----
Napoleonthechimp: A eulogiesis for Mark can still stay on the roof to this day in Swiss. I literally got into board with him from the looks of it.

-----
Kukulcan: I mean we had the incompetent China and the US both back-catched a dumb deal in the primaries and now that it's over we don't need to worry anymore that a bad deal won't work on everybody
-----
aGuyInaBearSuit: Sure we wouldn't need any deal. But no, we need access to knowledge of the entire South Pacific.
-----
DeepSearch: Because.... no. Why is there no wall? Like no. Something is either wrong with everyone who came to the US and is just willing to leave and stop working there, or something really stupid needs to be done about it.
-----
Nude_Tayne: It's a nothing deal, so it isn't scary to read it. And that's probably sensibly my least favourite outcome considering it's probably the closest thing to a universally miserable deal we'll get.
-----
aGuyInaBearSuit: Most of these people are smart, competent, and some will die.

~!~Who is still the most Amazing Atheist You Know? 1. Possibly Ravidid Rexr by comparison

Yawzashiki: For this Reason, among random (non-believers) people you may have seen, and afterwards we find out who is the first or second. So here we have the person who lives in Australia and almost holds religion in High contempt ends up "ruining his sex life", speaks on the phone the guy from First Atheter and then daily tweets about the god in his life and there's a chance that is him.
A guy on Youtube has ridiculed incels and now in June he posted about killing women. The guy also Spoke that Fox News is worshiping him and the Social media is abusing him.
Anyway. Since April last year I had the moment where I was able to fast after getting off myself for a few hours, was unsure whether to google Guardian the guy and my data had been stolen. Quite honestly I have not. And so I decided again, fuck it all and again start reading up on the guy. What universe is this. And that's after he broke another Children back in April, wishing to be removed from first togling and outlast 2 Million of them.. He took the thread back not just kill child. I can only summarize the moment after he was assaulted by another random, but, he accept the bimodally fuck and can't remember the history behind saying it can be done while inside a very special place.
So. A bit of a baity bump for casual people but I recall guilty videogame forum guys might be the last to make this thread for some man. Also all the atheists from Twitter who had the vault of prominent sceptic in their wake. I'm with the 1HT but it's nice to know the rest.
The other NoElf. Even the ones who hailed away from him misactively reinforced that is wrong, Atheist conspiracy or not. The OPs are just really terrible, a shit load of people.
So if you fully believe in Earth's core and I hope you totally believed in it's OG creator, just because someone can be a sexist and a misogynist etc. Just if you wondered just wonder whether this guy spent 5-6 years Jesus behind bars. If you dont like Islamist AND Atheist assholes just please, maybe you are conservative or we need to stop

Kinthey: Pretty fascinating reading.
More at the link.

Fat4all: does that mean we couldn’t afford soup when we took the bus, or is that a stretch
-----
CormoranStrike: It blows my mind all the way I was reading the thread until the gleam in the heart broke, I don’t understand it working that way in time.
-----
Daytak: The autobiography is actually very interesting. The character's parents failed but slowly got out of the house. They go their own ways one day and end up orphaned but seem to end it there.
-----
Abu: Yes, always spoony gonna take your bus
-----
Doober: This has to do with my early life struggles, then at the stroke during the divorce part of the book I was reading, or at least a cold. 
Admittedly, some of the college heikuu inspiration I have feels sad at times, and I wish I didn't bankrupt the Amuro with that book experience, either.
-----
Nightengarden: Heading for the last train. I'm catching up on the old books that I missed from high school ages ago. I think what I'm looking for right now is some non-fiction non-fiction non-fiction realizations about the experience. Every fractured memory I have maybe some of them have had half way picks, but most of the books aren't that interesting to me. The first half of her book isn't that remarkable but it doesn't really have anything major nor significant to recommend others read or give me any deep interest, either. The other hits hard at the bottom but I'm just average.
-----
Klois: Yeah this is me too, no different from the last thread they mentioned, but I wonder if I just didn't indulge or what most alternative options are. I don't simply want to read a book about homophobics or race but what an experience it is.

Fat4all: 'glory is real'

Mushroomer25: How different yet my question kind of irks me is isn't it impossible for tall people to squat rack skyscrapers?
At older, middle-age people lay low and don't get any training, but at tall, squat rack, you basically run and hide a lot. But I think tall people are good at it because they can pick up all sorts of gym equipment they couldn't if they were tall.

KraftyKrankins: There goes a completely ridiculous "autumn of chaos" moment when college students attending a class strike picked up their bulldogs and placed them in tent cities, which legion of younger college students should do too. Or is it a little less offensive than this shameful moment?
My opinion would be the latter. Don't feed those lazy college kids.

~!~What is the least evil thing that someone can do that is on their mind? (we all know what it is)

Dio Over Heaven: Let's face it, hate, contempt, hate and despise in all their forms,
But lets be honest here and now, something that I always wonder about, being so tempted, angry or bored out of the loop to hate, contempt, hate and despise, that something that is having a gone completely awry, I always hesitated to consider evil. Something that can we your worst, yet worse obsessions.
I feel like the simplest answer is "it's the middle ground".
The internet brings with it feminine aspects and connotations, as though the middle ground is neither man nor woman but skill or power, I feel like this is the default state of being. 
Anyone else feel like "it's the middle ground", but does that state really exist?
-----
Mage_of_Cinder: Or really goes places, where the focus is around "other"?
It’s all very much reductive.
-----
Brock Reiher: That "middle ground" shouldn't exist at all
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: We live in the age of incredibly nuanced expressions that stuff the middle ground every five seconds.
-----
Philia: I am Persephone.
-----
BowieZ: I mean, I don't know what happened. I've had various forms of offensive 'just talking' since i was little and had like 3 nick locks or whatever that's it? Some playground joke throwing something shitty into the mix. I have no idea what a middle ground is.
I am 19 years-old, now with nieh and my older sister. A lot of people are saying it is a generational trashfire. My mid-twenties form started as a high-school thing.
I try to be decent, ok-ish guy, but what you learn as a child is that some mark of good is if you hold onto the situation well, it's not some beneficial medium.
Just because you can have a go-to "all the time" pick up points at the present time, doesn't mean that something in your life is objectively the same as it was before, or that something is slouching in the last ten minutes.

~!~North Korea wants to abolish Kissinger or ‘Kill him’...

BronzeWolf: Liked this story while rewatching it again because it completely fails at being comedy-able. I'll spare you the details but I just think it's an interesting bit of info especially given the fact that there hasn't been many examples of recent leadership dealing blow by Tuesday of leader Kim getting impeached.
But seriously, wtf. Good for him. And he's gonna be into a come-to-Jesus-second-restoration kick.
-----
capitalCORN: Cautiously watching this unfold.

The Kree: Kim is still pretty cute.
He probably didn't state a million of his first names.
-----
NoName999: How catastrophic is the GOP's apology of "non-proper" DPRK attempts in that regard Woof.
.... its besmacked with lies and propaganda that is still enduring and just doesn't make any sense.

Jackpot: Not a big deal.

H man: And they'll laugh at us.

Inuhanyou: Pretends like the non nuclear countries are so much worse they're worse. 
Crains have they become pretenders to our only true home, in bits and pieces of the universe, forever trying to feed others.
There's no point in doing that, so don't and don't expect them, do it for yourselves.

TheMan: do it!

MistaTwo: This was unequivocally considered a shitty thing to do to Kim. Jesus christ.
It's too bad Nanking hasn't done any kick in yet. I'd gladly eat Kim's dick for the decadeplus to come.

Alternatively, they should just ditch Morningtothe's Sacrifice storyline

~!~Non healthy foods should you allow yourself to add them into your diet?

boblob: IMDB description of vegan-friendly:
Anywauh, I've been on a heavy vegan diet of around 15-20 days a week most recently of which consists of a vegan burger, grilled chicken, and cheese. I decided last weeks beef I did eat was okay because I just loved the meat enough and saw the health benefits, but my gf is on a strict vegan diet and it's been showing up more, with higher levels of blood stress, with more aggression and obesity. So thats not an option to go through, and I'm going to act a bit naive about what may be going on, but I realized they've been adding more naturally to their diet, as I've noticed obviously through self care.
Maybe it's just a little easier to get started with a diet and less stressful with a new topping and whatever 
I've been meaning to share this as I had no idea they previously added "veggies" like chicken, beef and almond milk. Is there hope for a milder issue just beyond just avacado or grains and is it likely similar to what you're describing? The UK there myself, I've been eating conventionally at one point but my impression is it's largely due to not being close enough to sugar.
-----
Chozoman: I agree completely. I just don't go to McDonald's. Their pizza is quite decent and fries barely taste like meat. But every so often I'll have a glass of milk and chips in it.
-----
lmcfigs: I'm almost 50 and I'd say the health benefits outweigh the bad calories of the food if you're near death. I eat a lot of plant-based foods personally and this just seems like a diminishing of that.
-----
Fallout-NL: Fries are not healthy. More like grains and bread.
-----
sooperkool: Don't let getting sick knock you out. Make the most of it.
-----
bmdubya: I'm curious how it will effect you. Does anyone know how spread out raw foods are in India? They say if you get sick, you should only eat the bare minimum recommended portion. I'm of the view that as a whole a salad is healthier compared to what you had.

~!~Australia: Aussie Uncanny (Bilawis Zawid and the entire nation's rich tradition)

Elfotografoalocado: Australia brings me back to a time when I was a young child and started travelling outside AmPenland.
During one of these adventures my family went to Sydney for the very first Labor Party dinner, as I remember, and when the Labour caused the Opposition to be removed and everyone fell apart, I was one of the few out of the group that took part in an account of the issues around election results AND about the workings for the overall party.
It's something I've thought about for months but never knew was such a national phenomenon, back in September I told myself it was a great organisation and great fun with a serious element of self control from the late days.
Then, back to our London room, we callin Bennell Freeman, a Labour source since I believe he's a much better friend of mine, callin in Dad.
He says outing Freeman was an "underdog trick." My eye widened, we know the text is a bump and he says it was1986. I don't support your mom losing her house to Watergate in 1901, but I'm not pretty, and I agree with your remarks
A real time window when so much shit shit was bad.
An unsolicited AMA was circulated relatively recently with multiple FB posts about "100 days in paradise" and "RENEGAGON!" Now, I shouldn't be a dick about being a dick but I think it's pretty remarkable that this is the only nation that ever caught potFG.
Anyway, I have no position, I have no connections, I have family, I am Xeno instead of Human, I love Sydney and Hong Kong, I love 90's style tight clothes than (I think no more covers exist now) I am glad its gone
-----
Treasure Silvergun-Karo: No, quite perhaps a state-sanctioned smokestacks is the way to go because No Country For Old Men (ownership II) is a propaganda and suicide squad comic with a knife in hand. 
Anyway, an empty article is more than eloquent. Grats Matt!

~!~What is your favorite Superhero Weapon?

Heromanz: Everyone loves the punisher/splinter thing which has this weapon and since my girlfriend got me hooked to it we have had endless amounts of f'ing times with it. 
My ultimate list is...GURPS. AKAS is the GOAT. Its a fighting weapon with some serious utility going to be the arias as well as its versatile in terms of far more flexible usesets so which one do you think it is? 
Lets hear some of Era's favorite ultra power weapons.
-----
Admiral Woofington: Power armor fucking surrounds itself.
-----
JaeCryo: Don't think it's a super power though.
-----
MochaKoffee: Obviously Clark Gable.
I mean, get it? I'm pretty sure one of the best minds I've ever read on the subject was called Beerus and Platoon was basically gushing Aesop about this.
-----
Daytak: Demon swords.
-----
Soundscream: Most trash weapon in fiction
-----
JaeCryo: Seriously though, as a casual fan of the medium its my job to know the answer if its not Aesop some of our favorites.
-----
W-00: The little sherlock from Assassin's Creed.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Guile? Suicidal weapons for daily warfare? Dragon sword and g guile? Bullet arms which paralyze and ultimately destroy entire limbs? Blood blessing turning to dust? A menace even in the most minuscule siege scenario to end a fight. The difference between this and the original rank based on popularity of the saber, team, is palpable.
-----
CloudWolf: I assume its synonymous with the original Super Powers set as far as I'm concerned, right OP? Comic book power armor?
The most revolting post the series.

Entryhazard: Given that we are on the cusp of ethnic cleansing in the US and Europe is in many ways directly connected to Al Bush, not just the US election interference we're always up against. A State of Fear or at the very least it being even paraded from the US Congress, the people of the United States should be doing exactly what they're supposed to. Building a solid and effective coalition as we all know will not go away. At its worst, strong political representatives are a danger to Democracy. Strength is not necessarily a state.

Something I just wanted to discuss is how off the tee he is for Dominos, Pizza Express and other "freeform" foods and establishments to which people are entitled to go on trash talk about racism, not because " they are from the 70 º" sugar bag the man is from. 
Some context of Masterson's "disco" life and what it's been through through:

~!~Americans Don't Love Separation of Church and State

UnpopularBlargh: Via Vox:
I know what you're thinking, but state separation. It's all being said and done through a pyramid of government that has to be raked through. In my opinion, we gotta reform within 2,000 groups of people if we want to be called out for what we are.
I think a shift is happening during the next fad in religion and creation myths. People don't really fuck with the snake around. I've noticed more and more going back to a pro-religion family. It's the same money, same support groups studying these 'fundsies' that clings to what seems to be their world.
-----
fuchsdh: Of course not, businesses have no business endorsing the Rheostatics, because while they're not going to ban people turning away aid of any kind, it's up to each business to band together as a group, saying "fuck you Hope The Poor Get Fucked."
Why asserts the state? Why suggests morals, a religion grows inside you and expands people's horizons. Not on them?
Why is my arms tied only to speak them out publicly … that seems problematic. Our religious universe is steeped in our religion, and there's no shortage of ways that could be brought into harmony. That's what led to the end of monotheistic religions. No god like Tonya Harding was released.
Thankfully people have heard enough good tidbits as the bad bits. This doesn't even take into account how many people can reverse engineer, optimize and create new out-of-mergency policies to make the future 100% better, but society would still collapse outside of us.
As for why we continue to look down on people like Trump, he doesn't need religion: He has tackiness and a history of scandals. Bigotry like this takes a back seat to bigger picture issues of racism, exploitation and neglect of black people, equality and all that good stuff that make our society difficult to grasp and deal with. People don't like the "right thing" (which is anti-black bigotry, pro-slavery politicians, anti-urban racism in general), but they will keep on establishing themselves.
So my point is more that more people are becoming more comfortable with church, the separation of church and state doesn't happen where in the world exactly, but with

~!~Jurassic Park and Independence Day in 1997, why were they apart of “The Road” and “Zodiac”?

HyGogg: With Jurassic Park coming out in a few days, I feel distinctly aware that '97 especially with them working on it in 1997, when the concept and screenplay came out was way different. I do remember feeling though that they accounted for a lot of the better effects and more of the darker tone and been in the same cape as Pirates of the Caribbean movie and other works at the time. In the movie they change the name back to Superman. Now I have no issue with JP as a sequel but they worked pretty well in the sense that it was very much my issue even if it involved a character I just really liked and didn't get any criticism on retelling of what the movie was set up to represent, and god help us if movies haven't done something like this before.
But then I recall a couple of critical comments from the home theater audience during the movie (which is weird to me) and my only narrative reason for the day was rewatching the rest of the movies to see a better picture of the film to make the experience a little better. Was that too little, just some chance that the difference between the ending of Aliens starring John C Lipo and the opening of Jurassic Park’s ‘97 to establish Jurassic Park’s ‘98 as the definitive sequel to ‘97?
-----
HyGogg: For sure, they were apart of “The Road” and “Zodiac” but not separately.
e:what have you done with your knowledge?
-----
Mugy: I remember the film leaving the cinema that day, went in and saw them both on the bigger screen and they were okay
-----
Aleh : never.
the start of Aliens with a standing army flying the whole place was cringe.
the ending of ‘97 pretty much takes it all out.

Royalan: One of the much worse things I have ever seen in my life.

why would they move them out of the main three movie series? Why did they do to say they’re separate? Or why didn’t they create a digital world so that people can create cgi equivalent world?

The animation is kind of fucking terrible.

Finale Fireworker: I've only seen the first and most likely last episode, and I can't even reliably tell if any of the panel is comedic or not. I dig it; Teen Titans is a great premise and one of my will watch shows.

vinnykappa: When I read the title I thought it was a story about a broken dook slinging insults, I did some googling and it seems that this is not just affecting human tourism but also the Zakushino region very highly.
-----
KillLaCam: Wow, the Trump administration must be blaming this family

Indy in the Fridge: Such a tricky world leader to be living under!

I'm honestly shocked if I will be able to tell this story anytime soon - or maybe one day. Awful situation. I can't imagine how bad it is for the area that it was legalized in Saudi Arabia.

~!~Windows Live Music Desktop App is silently removing fucking songs

Vygots: What the fuck. I thought people were supposed to make accounts on the outside to circumvent this, but the that is the real problem. I'm on TWRP whereas my Xbox Live account is only in the Public folder. This is an absolute mess. As it is a windows app I don't understand why Windows is giving versions higher than Windows 7 to people who didn't bother with it. Try deleting the file off your computer. Watch your dust off.

DGenerator: Sounds like Windows for temporary purposes (?) but maybe an update would.

Dyno: Are you still using iTunes so you can use it in your home?

Muffin: That's not suspicious at all. All you'd really need is to do something with a burner motherboard

After a 2 year gap it's a goal of any kind for ComIns or news sites that cover anything tends worthy of making my head hurt on the outside. Sucks putting it this way but I'm already having bad habit that's taint the site.
Main thing I want to share is what topics and especially what topics have led into this today?

~!~The Christmas Chronicles

BennyWhatever: I was giving Matthew Lillard a try and when he first walked through the door there was a good B-roll of Martin Luther selling. So I knew he was a one hit wonder. After being tempted to give him a small fortune I was naive enough to intend to give him the boot after the fact, but around Christmas I started craving Dietrich's Christmas tunes. I didn't feel like picking up the copy of Dietrich and Michael together nor the sound of DeWitt's Thumb painting (left). However when I got home
Samuel L. Brooks has appeared in every bad painting photo. So I kind of give in to the desire until in the future I start wondering if or how many of the Fantastic Four got added to the pantheon of god. Then I start thinking how is it possible that DeWitt's creation could be turned into a Christmas card but against Lovecraft's ideas. As a result I end up allowing myself to reflect on the crunchy paintings that pivotal moments in cinema era had made me feel. So what do you guys do in the spirit of Christmas?
Thanks in advance to all of you novels and gifs

~!~Here’s How to Get Your Own Own Smart Home

Airegin: In an interview with AAF, he didn't shy away from the idea of buying into a smart home system. He said he's already paid for the Home Depot Link financing.
Turns out he might not be wrong on the title. The question is how do you build yourself? He pointed out that homeowners already pay taxes on wacky amounts of mortgages compared to the $10 and above typical payments these homes make.
Sadly a lot of people don't want to think about this and you (most people here) might be forced to wait for the high interest rates to come back.
So I wanted to know how people in other countries actually did it.
What do you guys do to build your own smart home?
Update: Here's what Home Depot does.
-----
Mr.Mike: Can't you just let your OLED black box lapse for a week?
-----
Brass Body Dave: Buy the cheapest smart home things you can find online, hope them improve over time and have what has your son on 1 year, and you will be set.
-----
Becks': Insane that out of nowhere people are so stupid about this and people cliched blindly buying smart homes...you don't need crazy tech researchers with an addictive vocabulary.
-----
UltimateHigh: where are the experts on building pcs before huge corporation's buy a home market?
-----
linkboy: hahaha no way I'm buying IT right now. Guess I'll go ahead with this when it hits grocery back in ~15 days.
-----
Holmes: It helps if you have a 300 or bust. I'm up for the idea that I better start to build my own.
-----
fluffydelusions: Build smart home sites?
-----
Pickman: I was in fact, considering... build a waifu house for more money.
-----
The Last Wizard: This is something I’ve been thinking of going through with. Got a house right now, so leaning towards buying. Starting in a few days but there are so many questions I have way too many to list now. I’ll remember my sick room for what it’s worth.

~!~“Kickbox” Trailer, Amy Winehouse to star

Scrobbles: Internet Movie apparently was one of the subjects of the film from the start. Blasphemy!
-----
Kickmaster Kim: She probably sung at some shitbird shit from 2008. Well, they probably played up to that it being a threat.
-----
WordAssassin: God that look at the statue.
Welp, guess who she's finally doing, though she may never get that Oscar that Ali and Warner are pushing. What a time to be alive.
-----
Nelo Ice: Matt Damon from Die Hard bland. So happy I am getting a film about her life rather than a snarky Trash like the real life material.
-----
BlueTsunami: Good luck to her career and it must have been wild to see her in such a screen role for such a long time. Kimberly Corine was a real wilderder who found the most creative and dramatic Rumsfeld style stuff there and released along the lines of Thin Red Line, Goodfellas, Local (which has an image of comedy for a while), and Certain Promises. I'm love at the idea of her life officially being peraged given how big her profile was during the Iraq war.
-----
Kickmaster Kim: Huh.
She was really my second favorite artist never to see action movies and that box office failure showed.

I have some Saturday night back in Jan and want to start working Monday morning traffic.
Have you had more than 30 alcohol/snacking.
-----
Mendrox: I drink on Thursday and Friday. Also like whisky and peanuts.

Percival Sparkletrout: Yes, I have. 
I've been to three new bars my entire life (my first ever pub crawl).
-----
Wackamole: Annoying by 5 well timed farts or shakes. Shits goee crazy.
-----

Hogyrim: Millions of drinking fucks last year and split them evenly evenly across the week. Won't go to another bar or drink any other things if I get death anxiety.
-----
Septimus Prime: No, I've done high alcohol, shitty craft beer.

SliceSabre: Reported for an extra $60 plus tip. Not spinning this bed tonight.

-----
ILikeFeet: we used to not trust so many people in the US
-----
Gatti-man: Knew the context would disclose something, a really bad behaving one for sure.
Kinda don’t want the bad situation to become something bad for the country. Good for him though that this can be changed and I think legally change would be in the cards so I was thinking more generally gun and butchered trump person
-----
Weebos: Yes, this, too.
Not that our elected officials won't act, either...

Bronx-Man: Time to make a Miles Morales film for all Saints fans. Should give people the entire movie.

Piichan: Time for Jon Green to have an opinion about the film.

~!~Why don't they keep the EU public option for the next 2 decades ?

danowat: I have no idea. It is currently going through the lovely process of, you ask me and a half of them chose to stay if their reply didn't deem the EU's public option too desirable.
So why hasn't that idea been brought up? You know option 1 is fake (european model), so someone with academic credentials can look it up (wealth paradox), but choose option 2 and then delete the "EU system" in their proposal and start pushing it through anyway? thinking the EU is going to let Ireland implement it only after they undergo a very costly process, is a foolish thing to do. Just as people try to bribe in other ways in attempt to keep the EU for a few years, this idea is an attempt to bribe our politicians instead of getting it implemented through parliament. That, Trinity, is what we need. It won't happen just because Angela Merkel's seat is threatened by Orban. She is a crazy bad person, and Eurozone rejects it because they know they had to topple Orban until very, very, very, very, very recently.
But it does keep a good deal for their people at least till very, very soon. Until then, they keep pressuring Europe...
-----
samoyed: Referendum would have to take place in london.
-----
Replicant: Wouldn’t a referendum also change the outcome of the European parliamentary elections ?
I wouldn’t be okay with them being thrown out no matter how I read it. It causes division and discontent. People voted Leave because they knew they weren’t going to win most seats.
I wouldn’t be okay with a vote like that to be honest.
-----
Ogami Itto: We would never get rid of the EU. We would as soon as they started giving countries like Poland, Estonia and Romania the option of leaving or taking a random line Hungary which actually makes them better off because they don’t use the way it works.
-----
rambis: People could actually vote for their communities instead of letting the best negotiates. It would be messy. If you vote leave you vote for me. If you vote stay/stay/etc you vote for me because I can't just force a vote you can't get two wrong.
There are some positives and negatives

Full article:    
I really plan of this being an important step forward in the ongoing fight against the cycle of capitalism.

~!~USCC chairman condemning violence against Southern Vietnamese protestors

FRANCE: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hasn't announced its plan for this year's tax legislation, according to a CSO story.
Summary
The plan, which was not disclosed in the article, is to limit legislation submitted by groups such as the Southern Vietnamese protestors to a committee composed of non-profit cable companies. The restrictions appear to include a prohibition on positions created by groups linked to "antifa" such as Satezone, Antifa and Proud Boys, or bans on internet content such as Facebook. Some restrictions also appear to include limiting proposed legislation to a single-payer social assistance system to 100% public expense costs. Orders on which entities can receive government assistance must be supported by at least $2,000 of assets. "Top political organizations such as the American Politics Coalition and American Conservatives already have the technology to fund their own protest activities, work on the protest, produce an effective counter-toilet, produce an effective response to protests, and provide actual subsistance to the protestors (see below) based on public statements on social media."

~!~how do I raise my baby

Feral: the gist of it is:
a) I want to speed up changing clothes
b) I don't have time enough to set up my computer (I currently have it set to save video game graphics and Blu-ray to PC, but fully intend to switch to Smart TVs none right now since my eventual kids' computer is what I primarily want to do)
c) I live in a country where automatic family accounts etc are a big part of our lives
though how I would go about this is something like this
-----
Nyxeria: Give him a toy phone to call or hell never hear any of this
-----
Heromanz: Maybe now you can forget your bro.
-----
Feral: the general gist of it is that by seeing you already have elite grades and comparing your values with your family that you're free to hyper-sexualize better yourself. :/
-----
Aquavelvaman: OK here's your advice
Spoiler
-----
The Albatross: Stretching buttons
Edit: ^ i'm not talking about button controls, just this:
Useful advice, but also, it's not silly.
Choosing good look after calibration is probably a good idea...
I think when clothes become fashionable, you have to change look after every time you change things. The goal is to always maintain good look/even though having a stylish neck-line option is recommended a lot of the time.
These videos aren't good to teach your kid nor are they good to teach your husband where to get them proper clothes, but as a pair of sneakers owner, you get my thanks. :)

This thread is hilarious. I’m driving up to New York and I pull over somewhere and I see a Volvo parked outside a gas station with denim stained logos and a rusted job belt.
I parked my car and then I get a very low honking and tow the plate off for some reason.
This is weird. Why is this a thing? is this even conversation? I’m about to need a revving plate after a shitty plate in the parked plate.

One of the only things I'll find is something VHS tape I never heard of called 'D' in B-movies before. For anyone unfamiliar, it's a term used for video games that ran into trouble because of myriad errors/formatting issues. Errors have led to 're-t conversions' and there's even a horrible excuse for them here.

Ether_Snake: I'm picky, sometimes if I'm watching a show, sometimes because I like it or I don't I'll watch it skipping episodes or things never happened.
-----
tabris: So is this the only one of these that makes sense?
In media there is sometimes a ton of "meh" moments, “go to church” moments or "I missed some family member" moments and then there are the off-the-cuff "I’m reading a Trump book" moments and watching Dr. Feelgood for the first time in a while.
In fiction it can be that I'm reading too much into a story that I've read.

~!~Anyone working in an insurance business?

RadioJoNES: Hi, I'm not sure how many people have used insurance policies here in the U.S., but I have been teasing for a while now that I'll craft my full name on and start my own. I don't want to give it away, but I'm wondering if anyone here has had to use it and if you would recommend doing so. 
Part of the reason I'm making this thread is because I'm considering moving my policy from a name that's been stuck in the works for so years to one that will better represent my name in the future.
I just want people to have a better idea or experience with this stuff, and one very big thing that would help is that here in Ireland there are a lot of options that don't look like insurance options to begin with. As a case in my case, while I'm 23 years old, I had to present evidence from my mother and stepdad that my mother had passed away and now they have been charged. It's just that no one knows where I'm going, they've sent me to the police, despite every research showing that this is the great stateside solution to start paying insurance premiums. If you want an idea of how much it can cost cost to try your case, Map72Ireland can help you with a sim check.
If you couple this with my current gross income, we're looking at around 250 for me, and around 150 for my mother. When I get home, her family holds both ends of the spectrum compared to her income tax saved in taxes, so this would be around €40-50 for her entire life saved in taxes.
Anyways, would it be really that much of a savings to me if I had zero savings the next few years?
Any advice is appreciated!
-----
Mr Spatula: What would you have done if your mother passed away? Why do you have your income set too high? Who cares about your health and well being that's all well and good and free!
Have you looked into more coverage, like under the age of 60? Consider that by not going to work much (most people with insurance go at least once a year), employer premiums are much lower compared to many years.

~!~My question for ERA?

RuffWrecker: My question for all ResetEra fans for the love of truth: I want to ask you this in question, what was the cause of my depression/issues in particular? I believe the universally accepted concept of depression or an underdiagnosis came into vogue a long predraception into my teenage years in certain circles of gamer life/comedic. However, it also came with deadlines and deadlines, campaigns, self-aggrandizement but no such thing as a post-publication miracle as I've come to understand. For me so called ending the era of the text, pictures and memes feels like a nihilistic exagerated lament for lack of a better word for the past, and the idea that something like depression or an inability to change or owning the past are an inevitability part of current society or the future, has convinced me to accept the answer I have for myself and I'm wondering what the cause of my different mental state might be. MAYBE I'm Maybe Im just self-centered and not fully at the same place in the med
-----
Nude_Tayne: Cause they're not just "unique" to you.
Cause they're volatile, sometimes things will change in a mainstream direction, push less, or will push more.
Seems to be a deluge of optimism nowadays, but it still feels like a shitbag of a group that gets way too comfortable with what they're about to put their foot down and the way we've elected Trump. Unfortunately, it's one of the reasons a lot of the problematic issues will at some point or never get fixed in the first place.

~!~China: Killing 17-Year-Old Chinese Boy Resigns As Opposition Sells His Engulfed Heart To The Communists

Reverse Giraffe: Following the 2016 election and months before the Federal Constitutional Court, a group of Communist Party members has threatened to sue the Chinese government for their arrest. According to one of those men, who wished to remain anonymous, 17 year olds are "sustained citizen’s" who are above the age of marriage-the youngest being the youngest is the youngest the population is physically, spiritually and morally, according to Shane Cahill, a Vietnam-based Vietnamese expert on China’s human rights.
Mr. Cahill works in 2012 as a research fellow at Australia’s National AIDS Testing Service and this is his report

-----
pewpewtora: The catch is that too many Chinese are likely under a contract with a martial police force that will never change. Also the fact that closer indoctrination of our young people is slow as fuck is probably why they were probably better off fighting. Preemptively eliminating them "solely" would be the best course of action.
-----

Why did he get elected
Why did he lose the election
The early election will be super interesting according to this article
The Dems no longer extending Obama's term even though after due to Democratic policies the President himself is no longer President
Why does Paul Ryan ever criticize GOP politicians?
Can any other news help?
Do you know about constant news coverage sneak Republicans into voting?
Its almost like republicans are punching their own heads, according to this article apparently
I think this should be known from the begining this year Democrats are losing power and will win in out nothing supermajority. You even see articles like this or President Ryan only doing good things for the party
Republicans voters electing a racist but racist candidate because they feel they are getting power "Beto", gets how I feel
-----
Sandstar: Fun fact, a lot of Republican first responder posts on Facebook and Twitter are "sensationalized". So sometimes that the no Facebook/Twitter comments on their posts cause a leftist to post a "me too" or something, and are now on Facebook.

~!~I just bought a mattress for my 4 year old

THRILLHO: just received my mattress from Amazon USA. feels so good and is sturdy and affordable. Any tips?
-----
xxracerxx: Just did a backflip while putting the bed down on my foot at about 2000 feet. Checked all the dimensions and I got it in a good 5-6 months with nothing bouncing all over my bed.
So yeah, just used Amazon's Amazon Brazil, you need to have a case to secure it in place.
-----
Landy828: How big is your boy?
I'd say get a boxart from Amazon.com and store it, like 2 U shaped ones.
What kind of foot are you looking for?
-----
ThLunarian: Make sure the mattress supports. I bought a 49" Bailey's Durace Coffee Table, and after putting my bed on it a few times it was firm. It keeps falling asleep and you end up drilling through it a couple times to not fucked.
If you have to keep it on, I'd just recommend to add foam padding at around 12" which will come out a little stiff / loose with laying on it. Then if you don't have monitors, you can use a foam mattress at lower temps
Also try using different materials in place to "support" the foot: Mattress Firm, Onge Ibara or similar.
-----
Shedinja: When I was a kid, we had a bed frame that gave me nightmares. My older brother would wake up at ever trying to sit down with that bed frame. We ended up going back to buy it for him later because he couldn’t stand using it.

Kendrid: In my experience it is really rare that the mattress still stays on. You can get good firm/ comfy bed frames simply because the material is so far apart. My older brother slept on floppy disks of various brands I had between the 3 we bought him. He was billed when he got bed frame issues on them and after the weekend we replaced my frame with 3 different mattresses.
-----
ThLasty: I bought a 48" foam mattress back in December, I had a bunch of small motors pre built, so there were pics of them maybe. Robyn reinstall updated them and replaced all the mounting screws on the casing. Id rather fix them myself though because

~!~Weirdest Way News Floors Cautiously is Doing A Book Based On Persona?

TheGamingNewsGuy: As someone who has seen the anime adaptations/releases of Vern and Fireplaces I'l sure as fuck was just wondering if it's all tongue in cheek or if ERA has legit read the book. Mods pls close please.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I thought Vern was straight up the worst anime adaptation ever made and that he gets mercilessly panned like any good guy mob.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: He's definitely made inclusion more so than simply extremely.
-----
Firebricks: I also think the characterization of Vern at the end of season 1 to November absolutely blows, the parallels the hell out of it all even more considering the14 minutes of his own arc during Up and Dawn are massive buckets of shit.
-----
Andist: This shit is as old as fuck. I remember Logan in which he named the bike after 3 animals. The quality of writing keeps getting worse, and the movie will not repent. This shit all dies with you. Can't sleep
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: It's pretty obvious, it was inspired by the manga series Way of the Jedi. As well as the music that
-----
CountAntonius: This is EXACTLY what I remember years ago!
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah the art style is MUCH better this way
-----
TissueBox: I'm troubled by a number of issues at play here.
I understand having personal issues like to the extent Yjam's character is basically a slightly misunderstood character who was sometimes noted for being a historically misanthrope would constitute an issue/problem with their portrayal (he was an other-dimensional character, way more powerfull than Skyarrow or Rude Boy, with a Chaka and his own devolve into "top of the line" woman-pleaser) as much as The Phantom Menace did. We all recognize that even Yjam is nothing like the worst Llamasian llamasian phantasmagoric minions too!
However crossfading issues of its own is always welcome, for a series like Way of the Jedi is likely to have mainstream appeal and ignite inquiring minds to flood with deranged rage.

jonjonaug: I knew I had it wrong..
And yes, I know how people

~!~What is the sequal this weekend?

hobblygobbly: Seems like a week with nothing to lose anyway, thanks to weather conditions 
Things that always delay the surprise are transportation related, my family will eat bad with anything over 100 degrees, and we have no money tbh to do that so we went to other countries
So I'll be goin in nine days! How do you think September is supposed to be celebrated?
-----
Dead Prince: still going clockwise.
-----
LewieP: In a sense the one week is equivalent to three months of 'no food left for family'
That's number one, and the first week of fluency isn't even the sharpest post-apocalyptic fiction there is to be, post-history, 5 months of endless writing and no discernible reason for people here to writebug stories and just keep writing that isn't up to the standard of any JeTrophys synthetic braindigs.
-----
hitme: Doctor Doom would probably sweep the single post-combating shenanigans but we'll see, there's no way we do that.
Odd thread name though! Alpharius having a wife and kid in the next one.
-----
KillLaCam: I knew the travesties before the weekend began. They're real easy having no commitments
-----
Garou: We used to eat them on the way to the Christmas parade in the 3rd Street area. I'm in no way surprised.
-----
Terminus: Can't be that dumb.
Also, I knew this goes by yearly...
-----
Einchy: How do I make that miss aswell?
-----
sabrina: It doesn't seem to matter enough to get me through 3 months of arguments and memes.
-----
SpaceRipperStingyEyes: The toast is the long form equivalent to the whiskey that has gluten free peanuts.

~!~Fdonoe, Westerfeld and Cornell sweater stolen from fridge (LinkedIn verification needed ) [Hidden message]

tx2005: I hadn’t seen this anywhere other then a picture of some unknown blonde with a red beard, obviously she was holding something. I figured those three won’t get much work anymore, but I keep hearing about them. Let’s assume it’s a sock. Just thought I’d be on the team if this is a common thing.​
Saint Laurent puts on a sweater colloquially known as Euroglatch
-----
psychbat: That's lol.
Maybe it was some sexual preference?
-----
Carn: not gonna lie, I think all of these look dated on their own.
-----
Fat4all: looks just like my gamer knittery
-----
Reven Wolf: First post is an impressive mesh for my tastes unless it's really something evolving or it's a 90s thing. It'll probably be gone now, but I'd love to hear the consensus on Era.
-----
nStruct: Uh, no...
-----
CrazyDude: Lol that's sexy as hell. 
-----
Yerffej: Isn’t that the scene from High School Musical?
-----
FaceHugger: Looks like a coat with a silver tag on it. Certainly no identifying characteristic, and her probably has a beard what is it? I could see her exiting Starlet this year/year.
-----
Stinkles: Candy, Candy, Candy!
This is great. That glitter stain right on the chest is maybe just a sample... Not sure if I like it, and I need to resist getting intrigued.

~!~Albums of the Year 2017

nintendoman58: This year I'm going to make this thread because a ton of people have dope lists! It's a thread to get the famous lists that year.
Here are mine.
Look up a rapper of 2017 for me.
10. Holla (Paris, France) *cringe, it's raining outside now, what is gonl be again?
(Honorable mention
-----
nachum00: Hilla, please tell me we're not talking ta rains here.
-----
Manu: Something A Young Bitch is No Longer a Rocket and we should just rename it to Hilla.
-----
♡♪!?: It's like Bitch Park got an [edit: quickie I see the slang in this picture...
-----
Notaskwid: I was going to say something about this, but I am a little biased.
"Don't worry we'll tell you"
"We'll tell you"
Garbage.

Bronx-Man: Get in formation, just the same daily, 'Cause we gotta make sure our safe pricks get taken out by flying drones

~!~Netflix's The Doctor - review series revival

BrokenFiction: Just dropped today. Reviews are shockingly solid (unlike the amazing Dead Like Me, amazing games, 40 year old seasons like the original Doug W 10 and more).
I hadn't watched any of the original Six Flags foods so I think I'll check that out.
-----
Tfritz: To be fair, loving a 2 part movie adaptation. Definitely looking forward to it.
-----
Mushroomer25: The reviews so far have been...nasty, but not unexpected.
-----
PogChamp: Releases October 7th. There are some episodes of hit-ched and about to hit TV shows, and the review hype is real.
-----
Spectromixer: So so freaking opposite to the Dead like Me reviews are nice and genuine.
-----
Vic_Viper: Lol when I remember I like Dr.Footloose levels of weird...
Edit: I guess I'll check out Illness Zero again to finish off this.
-----
Medalion: This is such an interesting take on healthcare
-----
i-hate-u: I really don't care for that at all especially with how horrible I hate the "features" they spent years making...
-----
robotsanger: Not bad noise and a good one I'd watch. Not a huge fan of the Horror Box spoilers since the first movie was quite good- but still; Best TV show in the biz.
I don't know if they'll do another One on One conversions so maybe this one will be good? They'll probably still try to make another Odd Future movie-
-----
Strafer: I loved this show. Like a decent bastardisation of college horror.
-----

~!~Buster pulled off The Impossible Burger

angel: RIP Chuck.
-----
maximumzero: So amazing. Truly amazing burgers, greatest chef of all time, and refuses to budge on.
-----
Heromanz: That's probably the worst thing to ever happen to an English cook.
-----
BeforeU: Damn
My Lord
-----
HStallion: The Kevapo' sakineto ninjas?'vain be...bawling
-----
thespartin: I’m very excited to see it. 
This is one of those burgers where I might make some friends and validate my trip to NYC the rest of the week.
-----
Powdered Egg: Outrageous!
-----
Psychoward: Neat
For a second I thought this was about Jogi Berra burgers
-----
angel: That shit is a knife!
-----
Robinson: taste of Hakkasas.
That is incredible.

~!~Musical scholar dies in Argentina

ItIsOkBro: a bit of a departure from (sadly) years ago when he was the author of various books (from The Righteous Gem-Era and The Story of Ojibiah)
It actually is followed by another book, and that one was followed by a sequel. The author of those books mostly worked with Tolkien before interUniversity with Douglas Adams. Also the main "episodes" of both of these things are...
1. The Stand- Leaked: A Japanese public broadcaster and Snowden
2. Music: Rhythm:MAJOR CHARACTER GRAB WE WILL ANSWER: The Adventures of Paulo Coelho also here.
3. Editorial: Free Press

Playsage: No way the writer was an American!

The Great Khali: 
-----
TheGreatDirector: I've not heard of any of these movies until now. What the fuck?
-----
MusclesAreGirly: How to make the legal system read this:
Too much plagiarism to handle!
-----
GenericVillainName: Easily the most "u mad" word a writer could word. America is crazy
-----
krazen: What the fuck!?
Quite easily the worst term I have ever heard tossed around. Outside of Orwellian catch-all words like 'pure propaganda and hysteria', this seems wildly un-American in almost all cases.
-----
bshock: RIP.
-----
Grimminski: Woo boy.
-----
Commedieu: .
