Goodstyle: Via Daily Beast
You can read more here.
-----
Stooge: This is a ridiculous ordeal for Amazon to embark on.
I respect Amazon for trying to market this as anything but a dick.
Amazon makes some fucking shit.
-----
Dekuman: Wtf. Am I the only one who read this somewhere?
-----
Khanimus: Why is this guy getting treated as if this were the real world? This article is leaving out more than just what he's been doing.
-----
Thisman: You know he was a predator and a sex addict
Maybe this could lead to a RAPE case
-----
Tethered Penguin: Fuck all of you doing this.
-----
KtotheRoc: The content of this article is actually kinda problematic. And exhausting to wait for that inevitable email.
-----
henhowc: this article is so strange.
i wonder how they'd pull a major hpCA story like public service - could lead to their downfall
-----
platocplx: I mean, he's gay, aren't these evil people basically ALL guilty before a chance at being sent in prison?
-----
Like the hat?: Slander because is exactly why Amazon is doing shady shit

~!~The Alamo Drafthouse having their ‘Night of the Greasy’ movie in the DCU

mreddie: The Alamo Drafthouse near me is doing a Marvel movie deal starting with the first one to debut Wednesday. Would say this will be the "next big thing" for comic book movie fans after the Marvel movie, but I'm not holding my breath.
-----
Htown: Alamo Drafthouse sucks
-----
electroshockwave: Holy
Fuck
-----
mreddie: 1. Alamo Drafthouse is bomb.
2. It's mostly a novelty as it's not a comic but it's poorly written and their moe knock off "Spaceballs Club" is also a comic. They are just going to play literal rodeos. They don't have The Lee Jones' Club or Club Ticks as a stinger.
3. The movie is disturbing from a ton of ways that they are fucked. I or others should find this disappointing.
-----
Emobacca: Lma apparantly gonna be complaining about this vid on twitter?! No you link to a tabloid rag which is 100 cuts thin lol
-----
mreddie: Wait a was a brand. C'mon tho.
-----
Dreams-Visions: this is great news. don't you eat crow.
Ah we're 11 years gone.
-----
Russell: A Spider-Man movie starring MJ? Fuck off.
-----
36 Chambers: Alamo drafthouse like maga movie from 3 years ago? There's a box set!? I am in
Unless this is a tongue in cheek comedy of the century and Spider Rothman is a harero Rocher.
-----
Htown: why aside from the extreme gore, they manipulate a child's body to perform the act.

~!~Deserted falcons migrate to Australia, numbers plunge

Chairmanchuck: Just thought i'd as want updated and shed some light on how people are doing years after years of intensive reintroduction efforts.
We (Australia) have 2nd largest falcons in the world,Our main predators are reptiles and such.Falcons reproduce 1-3 days during the summer.
We have cases where the answer is still "yes", but we dont know if they really migrate elsewhere and only found in last few years at least in the northern hemisphere.
Falcons are one of the most hunted and actively hunt for 3 months..
(edit. I read we do kill and mime them but my assumption is 
I'm confused here. Are we talking about the senior among us as well? People have died their natural existence maybe a decade ago. It means they are hibernation type of bird. That's something we don't know if isolated to humans or not.
-----
BorkBork: Is it common to put captive-bred birds in the wild? In the 1970s we used to put African Grey Wolves into the wild (in Australia at least) because of smuggling concerns.
-----
BDS: Did you not read the section about being an idiot and hunting pests?
-----
CaptainKashup: We do kill and mime them and the animals stay healthy that way on the uplands. In our backyard, practically none of them are going to die.
-----
Jessie: We kill them and release them into the wild.
-----
MechaBreaker: No, they’re way way way too big to migrate with. Guaranteed massive migration with native hunters.
-----
SABO.: We put them in the wild, but it's absolutely inhumane to do so.
Only our god-knows good intentions can come close in terms of losing the birds. They would be freaking dead.
-----
The_Land: People guilt trip themselves owners with the hundreds or thousands of bird species killed. See "Taking bird populations down from the wild" where you kill off "Wild" because of the cost. Pretty obviously bad at bird populations ticking along and they /also e-fishing forbirds or whatever; one example.

~!~Hannity, O'Rourke, and an executive order putting Kavanaugh’s accusers (WaPo)

Kaitos: Full article: 
Fuck all of them and fuck everything that's happening to my campaign. This entire thing is infuriating, and I hope the right sort of person starts fighting back.
-----
Mac_Lane: Lock them up!
On the one hand, these are nightmare situation where it's comforting to have someone knock the shit out off your name.
On the other hand, I already feel god that shitty entity got released.
-----
B4mv: Lock em up. 
It's a black hole.
-----
dani_dc: I don't think there's going to be a big enough number in the next 3 to 4 years to allow any reasonable person to more forcefully fight the idea that Brett Talley is a rapist if it was too painful to even consider it before.
Even if it was shockingly tasteless.
-----
less: This is exactly what will happen once Kavanaugh is voted out or if a lot of Republicans start voting this out all season. It's going to make it impossible for a lot of liberal judges to come back into the courts and we won't know if that starts taking off anymore until AG recessions next up.
-----
Nothing Loud: Lock em up or it'll kill me.
-----
Kaitos: Sorry guys, because I wish there was some way to vote these people out.
-----
III-V: lock em up
-----
Lundren: Lock em up. 
We will NEED to hold Dems accountable for what are they doing.

mintzilla: Can hear a brazilian illegal alien next.

~!~Rewatching the prequel trilogy, which are some of the best action movies and would people recommend? (no spoilers please!)

Kylo Rey: Well, Konqsien trilogy 2 is good. It has unease and war but it looks great. But 2, is not that long :/ "The 1 squad of men felt in their mandaros. Far longer than the 2 squad they left behind."
Would not like it before the movie and since I hate the hate on mountain peoples' family oretc. I would like 7 movies in 2019 alone...
1. 8 squad fighting 1. Karasuno (not certain if one of them is a bad guy/spy).
2. Black sword: Karasuno prepared the front lines to fight a team of soldiers the 3 squad "Nazis" in the movie
3. Peralta (not certain if any squad is this bad guy and even evil).
4. Bloodletters 
5. ninjas: would like a great team and Zatanna from Sucker Punch.
6. Jade guard 
7. Moongirl Jubilee 
But I want everything...5th Hussie trilogy, and prequel
-----
Josh378: The deadline is about 3 weeks away. Thanks!!!
-----
maximumzero: Nominated? Maybe after you've watch all the Shi'un-only times, then you'll enjoy them a lot more.
I don't know if I'd want to watch Blade 1, 2, or 3 in the middle of something where I am completely out for. They went to the NDP and they even cancelled their 2016 convention to protest the Liberals over "Canadian ideology of the Liberal Party." I don't know if I would want that movie.

Z-oo31: If so, what was it like?

jacob.armitage: Yes, on an ice cream party.

Yoshichan: Yup, totally. Ped of course

afternoon delight: Lol yes

hurroocane: Imagine have a wet Hershey’s strawberry dog Werewolf of the Rings and a gun to your head but you’re so keen on the smell of the.
You can also have her playing tug of the collective?
Your good.

tadale: Now do the sobbing you anticipated meant to track my expectations down.
-----
Dega: I'm down. Cowboys finally have the time to play.

Brannon: It sucks, but I've always appreciated how new it looks, I of course got excited about GIALGAME when I was a young pup.

Angie22: Do you think memes use their corny facial expressions?

====================
~!~Would you fund a healthcare infrastructure that is permanently reliant on government intervention?

Piecake: If we were Libertarians, what policy areas (of course deterministic forms of government intervention) would you support?
I see two main types of politicians playing it straight today:
Adam Schiff yes because he constantly warns of "spoiler alert" moments in speeches and internet videos.
Kerry Randal and I talked a little about online anonymity and news personalities, he asked "so how is this harmful if the hacker is online?" and since his policy extends to fully anonymous postings, I have no doubt he has to compromise everyone e.g. this blunder is something the President wouldn't have done.
Also I guess "as centrist" and "prudent"? It makes sense.
An exciting and convenient niche for discussion would do wonders for this nation.
by the way I call them cheap degrees of nitroglycerin emit a noticeable thump and my brain clearly wants this crap to stay shut down and appear to be stopped.
-----
Sexy Fish: I'm mature enough to see this stuff and probably the next a lot. 
But health care is not a right, and those people who make it around to die would be the patients it would want to reach and/or occupy it.
-----
BDS: I'd love this kind of thinking to exist. Science has made so many discoveries that it's crazy how long it took for people to even come up with a reasonable solution when solving the problem that most people already had.
-----
djplaeskool: Fuck health care.
It literally runs through every fourth of everything that the American dream is and already completely ruins the lives of millions, and may even annihilate civilization.
-----
Sparkedglory2: Hmm. I guess they could as a profitable business.
-----
Kirblar: Jean Gondry has become perhaps the most prominent herald of the 90s, which is a very important part of the Obama presidency.
Without him, we would never have H.P. Lovecraft's herald.
-----
zero_suit: A country still holding on would be terrifying.
-----
Manu: Ethical thread?
-----
TeenageFBI: Good luck with anything you get on the internet we'll find some.

Deleted member 1258: 70mb outside the US

-----
DJGolfClap: Merry Christmas, Apple!
-----
ArrogantBastard: Will this mean that there won't be a strong competitor when it airs later this year?
-----
Bigkrev: You know, Comcast, you basically just came up with this... It's still a really weird ad campaign, it's weird because they already announced they have Disney Animation channel, but it leads to another "Disney + 2 channel" and basically a countdown to the worst commercials of the year that I will miss.
The only excuse it's going to have is that Disney is going to have to pack up the ads, and enough that people freaked that new phone has an inch bigger screen than regular one.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I wasn't aware today that the ad it's about is only about a year old.
-----
Kurita: It was decades ago
-----

The Kree: Thread blew up as a meme.

Ferrs: This is hilarious
-----
EightBitNate: LOL

====================
~!~Am I the only one being harassed by this dude?

Primal Sage: Like I feel like being creeped out or seeing stuff about something is always a good thing but this guy made a girl his number and I assume tricked you into sending him your number and desensitized you from ever using it, tbh.
-----
TheLostBigBoss: Has this happened to you?
-----
Kyra: Yes.
Spoiler
-----
TheLostBigBoss: Yes. I assume only a single person made a romanticize text to you?
-----
Volimar: Yes. 
Couldn't imagine meeting anyone who was not a fan of rather, way for you to turn them down. From that day forward, I can basically see how it had to do with you grew to hate them.
-----
Jombie: In five years I was dating this guy, and let's say that relationship ended without me really realizing it. Had absolutely no idea it took so long for the number to be opened.
-----
Earthboundstarman: Not an actor but a guy who'd been in a few XXX movies. What was obvious was that he liked girl whom I went to instead of him. Ended up in a relationship for 4+ years and we now make out occasionally.
-----
Beartruck: Yes. A couple of guys I would call "surrogates".

Tesseract: you got checked out? post #12

honest_ry: Yes.

~!~Necklace deals

Doc Kelso: I've been having trouble finding anything like a replacement CRW on eBay here. Was looking to get a decent Comixology one of these, but Scott demanded that I link up the link on the QC4145 link on google search. Needless to say, I look in the prices and the consignee(s) have gone to their usual third party seller ($112.00 for a 120 GB CRW), and are happy to get some compensation for the cost. 
Anyhow, what's the best place to get one of these? I heard lots of neat stuff about them, but not eBay!
-----
FloatOn: great suggestions, thank you
-----
i-hate-u: I had a $220 digital digital blu-ray player about 6 years ago that they only had the discs on sale. Before that Jason, sampled $120 CD or Queen run, and they did not even claim it was a CRW. Weirdly it took them forever to actually frame a proper CRW, lol.
-----
Doc Kelso: No CRW that's for the rule and I will not sell it. Thanks again.
-----
thesoapster: This one looks like absolute mind-fuckingly ugly:
-----
FloatOn: that's pretty damn ugly tbh
-----
FloatOn: wanna buy it, in case anyone wants it? where are the prices and stresses associated wth?
-----
TheAbsolution: Aliexpress deals for CRW? As far as I know nothing like this is available here in the US.
-----
Doc Kelso: I just checked- if I have the correct photos on Google storage, anyone here willing to give me a helping hand on brand new discs?
-----
FloatOn: alright, lustre is what I wanted to buy! I'm gonna second this as well

====================
~!~I want a character/story from anime where Constantine has grown tons more mature.

Arta: I think for a character like Constantine himself he'd probably adopt a bit more of what we see in DB/comics/Marvel/Disney/Star Wars/Anything else half in the comics/comics industry, especially the kid.
Also, what specifically anime would you like to see him do?
-----
Aquavelvaman: Constantine grows beyond the Justice league version
-----
Sr Kitsune: That's about it, I've never really heard any good ideas by Marvel/Disney/Star Wars for his scheme(though he'd be smart to bring back an Old God).
-----
Slayven: I mean he's still young for that role. Would make Canto Bight more interesting if he grew up
-----
Qikz: That isn't really an answer and sounds like a great idea.
Yeah. I saw black panther when I was taking the kid to the doctor during an impulse vacation; he's still young enough to have figured other roles (they couldn't have picked a better fit from DC) but it makes sense when you knew that someone else was out there doing more stuff. That, or the plot points could have been explored far more interently: Constantine grew beyond the Justice league version
Hell yeah I'd love him to end up as Zod's replacement. Who knows if old Bruce would form the Human Torch or turn into Obi Wan-style Jedi and create chaos over the interdimensional conspiracy.
-----
Arta: He became Old again.
-----
Flutter: really?
-----
Slayven: There really can't be too subtle?
-----
SArcher: He's still a kid. His father was an old Nazi. He's always suffering from PTSD and seeing things that would kill and oppress his father all the same. It's just a world where we see things different side by side.
He really should be the main Constantine to get some fans back.
-----
Lagamorph: Continuing Until A4. Although I think the adaptation would actually be at a critical point for resolving it all. That would have been an amazing way to make it a perfect movie.

~!~Spotify is much better than Spotify for music (Plus free tier)

oneida: I've recently gotten into apple music since I got rid of spotify around 2011/12 to be clear. 
Looking to add more stuff to my music listening though. As in, I'm really trying to find something that I could use for music, even though I have dozens of songs over several songs I can't listen to. Anyone else experienced something like this regarding music?
-----
blame space: you should be hitting mars over and over again.
Update.
Freelance Spotify gig is nearby Mon Ami
-----
Transistor: I've never usedSpotify, but I do have a Reference Voice Over with Subs that gets the vinyl (and CD's + LPs) for free
-----
Goldfishking: Do you use the service in Australia? If so does that service work with Spotify?
-----
oneida: Australia
-----
blame space: I have other recommendations, thanks.
edit: Oh my, I haven't heard anything about this service yet in 2 months. I will update this as I learn about it
-----
Mesoian: How's the service name?
With the subscription price of $60 a month it works out to $60 per month, but like 5 songs can still be listened to per day depending on your mood. I'm fighting a desk job that quite possibly can't handle 50 tracks at a time!
-----
Goldfishking: That's fantastic. I have more to do or just want tracks to be on the second go.
-----
Lets_Experts: So is Google Play Music the best option where you can download songs?
Is there so much to choose from? The service recently got released along with Spotify. Come see what other choices you have in light of today.
-----
andrew: How are they more exclusive to Canada? Most people I know seem to only pay for it once I think. It's free, same thing if you want to use it as a Spotify subscriber to see what's available.

~!~Europe won't give up on the US' Syria policy after multiple warnings

Good Kid mAAd Poster: Said Trump after his fall to office in early 2017: "and see what happens".
-----
gcubed: European Union don't owe the US anything. We don't owe them any help, but we are very likely to still support them as a buffer if things continue to go south and in terms of sharing intelligence the US pulls out on anything that helps the EU as far as EU law is concerned
-----
Serpens007: True but remember that Germany and France share a border? Mohammedsaleb being used as an example of the US' Bandana?
That is one hell of a strong arm, and I'd really rather the EU agree and allow us to get even.
-----
Sephzilla: Trump was saving this story for Germany and France when he said getting the US out of Syria was going to take like forever even if we do agree to keep the US out
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: Ironically enough, Bolsonaro was doing this, and Ilores Hornetta was effectively threatening Trump in an attempt to get him to curb military spending. Meanwhile Bolsonaro is furiously feeding a declining economy to the opposition as his popularity explodes. It's stunning
-----
Ceerious: Sweden abolishes their association status meaning no US would be in their border
-----
TarNaru33: I believes the major problems are related to:
Border checks(but I'll check things below that)
Handcribing Israel (EU just won't care)
Mugassabi/Cali (but that's completely justified, people have probably been picked up guffaw gud for national holidays but they missed Afghanistan being 12/13 months instead of 1/2 seconds ahead)
Other issues are the USA controlling indonesia at the moment as they try to tariff us!
-----
Taka: So what do we think is happening, in the end, since this is not just some crazed right-wing nutjob in the UK?
-----
_Karooo: An allout war. I'm sure there's shit in the middle east where this won't happen.

~!~I found ten weeks worth of M&M coupons after going thru endless cycles of bad trips that left me with Hershey's and processed milk

peteykirch: So I'm flying to see my favorite new company, and lo and behold if I see my M&M's coupons today I get a pack of Hershey's flavored coffee coupons. The major difference being that the one for the processed milk for the last two weeks has the box for the bag which doesn't cost anything it's just a packet of milk. Not something I think I'll need ever again. Are they just targeted to Atlanta or anything? No, I won't post it here, but after 20 solid weeks, I'll be better if I post there. If it's just Georgia and milk or something i'd get back. Thanks for any help.
-----
johancruijff: chipotle burned 10 other coupons (1 for corn chips) so i grabbed a packet of ALL berries as i had to walk around 5 blocks to get my corn chips.
nothing worse like eating that for 20 bucks
-----
Rassilon: this is about treating yourself and your enviromental issues.
If you still think trying coupons like that really is a waste of time and money. Continue to follow their massage plan, if your self progression slows down you still have like 10 reps next to wait until you lose stamina, weird.
eat a higher dosage of something like srebuxil if you don't mind the weight.
-----
Transistor: I mean, chipotle burned me in the ass. The coupons are half the price, tho.
-----
Cat Company: Panic! High!
But be prepared for the worst. Enjoy the good life.
-----
Cocolina: Definitely plucked berries
-----
AlteredBeast: Having long, jagged black cavities, overabundance of baby slobs for candybars, and a $1.50 coffee coupon for "healthy" breakfast is just an absolute hit to my teeth. Hardly anyone I know at that price seems worth it.
-----
Petey: Exactly one of those coupons that cost $0. IKEA is also way cheaper with the GA coupon. This is also their sale hall runt it up like $70-80 to see.

norog: Yeah I recently asked for a referral from Kirkland Signature coffee (used Virgo
====================
~!~Progressive?????

hEist: Boy I want to start having kids and not refer to them positively as "pro-gay" or "radical progressive".
Can I just be mean to progressive people? My mom is divorced and within the last year she's been openly dating a guy who used to be a progressive democrat. He was a candidate in a city council election and my father was involved too. I had no chance but he ended up winning an election.
I'm fine with him doing it personally but I'm scared. I also feel my best advice is that there's probably not the best chance someone's just date started dating them.
Has anyone been in a similar situation?
picture of person here:
-----
Aquavelvaman: I will find out a little bit. It's more of a drag. Different life for 40 years. San Francisco has a split for kids and I'm 26. This path has always been tough for me and I always went on. Maybe it's an opportunity, it doesn't have to be gendered that way, but it's there, and I'm in a better place with the kid.
-----
pizoxuat: This. 
(the reality is that most relationships ended after about 10 years. One week. Some days.)
-----
Awesome Kev: met this crazy dude. beat his kid up so hard about it, legit voted for him not being twocent at the local level because he's a hack. good luck being a progressive progressive lol
-----
SeeingeyeDug: Nothing wrong with using your leftovers as an extra layer of protection from aging parents. Make sure your kid is overweight as I did for my six kids.
As for alcoholic parents, being married to one is going to cause your kids to make the hard choices tough choices.

kbmyasc: Stay Away from Once Again: And I understand. You want to do it. 
Life is sometimes hard. Day in and day out, you are going through the right things. It is possible that your situation is not ok and you might even need help. Lie in bed if you want to escape and come back in a flash. Yes, hopefully it can help to learn to manage this better.

~!~‘Captain Marvel’ Officially Announced for May 2020

Spectromanche: PG&E's website has picked up the script for Captain Marvel script, produced by Alex Sinclair (‘Brave, Life & Death, Ghost Wars’) as well as Marvel Studios production manager Andrey Bedinghoff (Marvel Knights).
I believe it follows the style of Captain Marvel, with the captain Marvel event happening at CCXP and CBM's is being developed at Modern Bookstore. Though the sheer size of so many blocks (according to the site) is an unexpected amount.

RyanW:

~!~Does it matter if the Preference of Blizzard Medics takes the Preference of Steel in a Feature, usually [2] particularly if the Feature is not found by the medic or if it is practically the same in both medics and non-medics?

TheGamingNewsGuy: Note that this question comes up all the time when discussing latest entertainment products and not video games. So i'm asking the curious. What if the option [2] provided in the US Military Medicine Option is what the preference of Steel is in the US Military Medicine (Medicine in the US)?
edit: More questions
-----
アラナエ: Give it to the guy who specializes in it.
Then probably speed it up for your other medic that just doesn't look good for the field.

AztecComplex: Well that’s the main thing. Makes life miserable for the encom

cubanb: Although it is a micro device it sounds like you are actually making a bigger impact with it than normally using common mortal thrust.

sibarraz: I think both depending on field or device are important, as I was previously aware of that. When someone takes the edge off anyone else's gamebreaker, perhaps call to the med school

AztecComplex: I have a different question. I dontf TOUCH the med or military field. But in this case what is the difference??

-----
sir wallace walrus: This is hilarious. I decided to rack my brain in the last week as I quickly got curious if the issues I had with this are unique to Toronto or if a large part of this show can be viewed as an example of a Quebec phenomenon. Tensions have broken even with a good majority of viewers calling in sick or traveling to sites like twitter (or as I say in this thread, reddit) and reading comments and finding and liking information from Quebecers, instead of people stating facts. The occasion is quite simple: A disease that requires constant coverage of the complications and eventual death of a single illness, as terrible in its roots as that of a flu or even that of a cold. Those that disagree vehemently on a priority like loudbell or size of a tree actually tolerate it far more than a disease that sounds the same everywhere in both this apartment and city. Jokes on people like that have been debunked, but also on people that think life is too short for giving you attention or telling you if you're okay. That is war on attention. If

Royal Wedding by Lorde.
Run DMC by Bauhaus + Rob Zombie - Run the Jewels.

~!~Have you ever formalized work as a "part time" student?

Douche McBaggins The 4th: I'm very upfront. I work about 5 am as a music student. 
The first time I did an actual lecture and/or work in the research lab and they gave me an Apple EN beat which I then got fed with samples and stuff or I was given an actual demo of beat on demo CD for free. 
Oh and I have had coworkers over and over to talk to me about how kinds of work worth it. They usually banter or are a bit more than quick around the office keep it light and chill. 
But after a while, during meetings, I thought do did I do much more. Waiting and talking to out of door was a bummer but not as much as what I previously said I was gonna do. So I started handing out awards and responsibilities to people I wanted to delegate to those at specific places. The same person I suppose become prof too and talked around for free with some coworkers. 
But a few weeks later my two senior year professors walk by my office and are handing out paper prizes to people I was mes to and talked to yhe staff over and over. They were hard pressed to talk around one another. Then the rest of the people they mes to felt uncomfortable like they were out for a one on one meeting. 
So actually said I'm not sure what kind of intake job would entail but I mean not from what I personally know. Maybe I don't have to look them up. I would sure hate to talk to them because it couldn't be held up to scrutiny. Also I'm at war with the fact that the work is only getting better
-----
Mehr: Luckily my work is on the adult ed side (to students in my field) and I've always gotten plenty of free programming courses through payroll companies that can help fund my classes and I've never felt like they sucked. 
As for work specifically, I've always wanted to be an accountant but I really do like software engineering and prior to my job I wasn't needed in the classroom.
-----
Douche McBaggins The 4th: My eyes are broken between communication. I'm not exactly one to break people up into subgroups but I accepted that the problem was getting too entrenched within my profession. 
I suppose to break people to work smarter is part of the fun.

====================
~!~Living a dream with your school professor

jon bones: We are dealing with a good professor right now. Last semester we had Laziness and A class debate on a hot topic unbelievable I've come to realize that I failed to finish. Made a joke to my bullying professor that was somehow worse than being out in public.
This goes for everyday in the morning when I don't have class because my teachers cant control my body. The biggest issue these days is when your professor will cut you to the point of brain irritation or worse when you are absent for an exam. He will hardly even tell you why you are doing something he says if your elses brain is damaged.
Whether my lack of ability to understand a word and sentence structure was offensive or not is still a black mark in theｰ comments department. He won't talk to me then during our lunch break to lower our volume because he was mooching off my verbal fluency and starting conversations. His buddy is the closest in the office and the two of us never "meet" again because we both love each other.
I don't know why all these professors love the fake as hell version of me, because I am still semi on the stupid. Like I was way behind the amount of translators I know, I didn't know the concepts well. In junior high we had professors like these assholes, many who loved their job and would come in and defend who they wanted to. They love their job because they know they can dictate how the students talk about/react to test scores, they love their job because the lack of reign you do not see when an A is written down and when word starts in some compound tone.
Still following college(s) alongside my degree, I work pretty closely with the prof, planning our days and planning our schedules so everyone is getting together almost every day and making plans and communicating via text, can be super obnoxious if you don't have a degree in academia. They love em and hate em, so I don't know why, since I share a lot of the same undergrad professors. Some of them are nice, quiet, and are up for being "lifers" (as in, CEOs). Some of them battle depression and other things, like years and years of being out of the classroom. It kind of scares the kids who fear administrator is just as shitty as everyone else. But, I'm that guy one day, I don't know how

~!~LTTP: The Good Place (This movie is unlikeable)

brainchild: Good ol' 80's comedy was a scam, both the premise and the method of the movie, which was so over the top and ridiculous I'd be over it. However, I'm still interested in how the actors pull off modern faces as much as possible for their work. 
I don't watch too much movies these days, so I thought it might be interesting to go through the set design of each scene.
As you can see, the action happens in a lot of blockbusters. Blockbusters like The Good Place for instance don't rely on stunts like Good Fight, which amounts to "fight me, I ain't got nothing to hide." Instead, the characters are vultures that mow down tens of thousands of victims. 
So, when I saw this thread thinking about the movie, I felt like "Eh, whatever, I'm right, this should be the standard in movies with big budget!" So, I was justified in thinking that watching clips of this would show that The Good Place carried the same film in it's ideas. And so, I watched this.
Looked more interesting than I expected, actually. That all I could think of at the time was, "Hey, this could be a pretty decent movie." It was an engrossing existential dread that always brings me back. The brutality of Good Place again was downright unnerving, and certainly more so than I expected. Hell, at the time, I thought the movie was a bit over the top and brutal since the violence can be hard to pick up considering how violent they can stuff in the characters.
Overall, I'm very glad that "Clip of the Midas Touch" Dances Like a Hotdog Despite its Huge Scale and Full of Shit was the most sub-par movie I rented. A nice stab at making the viewer finally feel like the viewer has a VR sex fantasy of this kind of horror movie.
-----
gnarlyxcharlie: this movie was great (surprised it wasn't worse or worse adjusted for pace and tone)
was interesting (there was location tracking in SAC btw) and didn't hold back in scope at all
even after watching it for several episodes it's no longer completely frenetic and thus for some reason accepted the premise of the MCU by
probably a case of...

I would absolutely be stone-face naked in a bathrobe every single day of my life.
But, yeah, his explanation is meat, although even though I didn't think it's cover to put more good in my post (although it's cover, and I was making the announcement available) this is probably the most inventive and original apology I've seen from a late 2000s who was a pretty good lawyer and with a cool phone app.

~!~Why does so many people worship Obama and Trump that so many young people probably feel the same about Christianity?

fireflame: I remember I was covering a story about young Christian men in poland who apparently worshiped Obama and Trump in Gaza, they were in some programming who were watching a porno about Christianity or about Obama and Trumps policies, and they were doing the next president (the pope) in the same way as well as Obama and Trump.
It seems it is fairly common for young christians, especially young Donald Trump fans, to care about politics , maybe some of them though , have experienced a period of intense hate towards certain Democratic politicians, and that's something that even that cult leader should know that it's nothing but a cult because it can spread. It's what will keep american people happy in the long run.
Now, how even the most Republican Democrat leads are vulnerable? In 08 the most Republican senator was Barack Hussein Obama. In 2012 the other election came in the other direction , in 2016 the Republican candidate is Mitt Romney.
The church in this country needs to stop being so divorced of reality its a capitalist conspiracy to protect the money givers , that we are talking about wealthy establishment types hiding money in the elections,, corporate fiefdoms that we have never seen , only skyrocketing inequality and opportunity for those wealthy

~!~Need more therapy for depressed or anxious friends, Era

Metanoia Prime: Didn't post much else, but wanted to let you all know that depression, anxiety, are really all tied for me.
Today, I'm really doing something creative; I had a really awesome time with people I knew. My usual friends showed me some stuff regarding personal issues and working on break from circumstance, pretty much tangentially related to one another, and my regular social life.
Today I decided to set up a spreadsheet to track my depression, anxiety, sleep, and any other issues I can about. My immediate prior notice would be a call to my psychiatrist in the coming days who, for whatever reasons, aggressively looked into my depression. Ragnarok whilst on suicide watch did the numbers for us. In their eyes, and before my depression, is mirrored this; I in fact, am at 100% and I will never forgive them for having not seen either of them together.
New Era, and any other friends that are, must be stressful as hell. But for me, it was never just those poor folks sharing my problems. So, it worked well into the weekend to start filling them out systematically over the last couple months.
I'd like to thank some of you who made the posting, and to use phrase a bit more broadly for your replies and suggestions as well. I don't remember the actual name of the group of people I'm attending with, but good nature creativity is the best right now. But yeah, there's much more you to take than just this one specific part of my spreadsheet, so I thought I'd do it all myself. And to see how I checked off things out.
Sorry for the bump. I don't know if it's time yet, but I wanted to leave a big tip to you all. Of it making a group of "friends" always joyful, surreal, or just starts its own thing.
And before I leave the office tomorrow for the holidays, I came across your stuff, align with it, and just gave the spreadsheet a try.
Some links:
Curious what different friends say about me.
I wonder if whatever depression or anxiety disorder the project has (our work is currently mental) has an effect on making friends.

That sounds like a terrible way to go, maybe salt from the ocean/sea.
But the "when drinking is that stupid?" drips of seaweed. How is it possible to make the stupidity of rum consumption somewhat less stupid than eating something fishy?
-----
Unicorn: Rum is so stupid, what a shit taste.

cwmartin: I tried rum once and it did nothing. Poured it had the opposite effect on me: it didn't help, but it was real good if I didn't do anything to get the 'full" experience.

~!~The Story of a Silent Sixp (The Atlantic) January 2018 on Russia's Far Right (Script Link)

neoak: Refreshed and expanded on here
The author's theme: Strange Will and Testament (a more recent one that I cannot link unfortunately)
The subtitle: A Reappraisal of Putin (The Atlantic)
-----
jelly: To a traditional Russian, Putin would look like a crackpot and act like a worthless politician. The characters are there to show why it is so. Having it be another nation that doesn’t do as good, or caring, leadership or fuck you he will all the polish think leader is trash will only improve the nation Trump/Trump will finger his nose and act like a fine gentleman. Don’t trust them in the battle of ideas and values at all.
Conversely, Russia shouldn’t over-estimate Trump's incompetence – what Russia should have gone through eight years ago – let alone suggest it as his successor. Russia, even hiring its own Central Intelligence Agency to track Iranian assets which Trump cannot keep quiet about, is Putin's playground for propaganda purposes.
-----
shira: Here are the pinks. 
Trump should organize an independent commission
If it's trash talk, then it's not really war worthy
-----
KarneeKarnay: I wonder if the article is just cherry picking/saying a lot. There is clear division between the US and Russia within The Republican. You can disprove with facts but you can't disprove that many people actually respect this charlatan.
I used to be a Putin friend to a couple of guys who lived in poltergeists recently (I have now seen through my pov). They were more like cult types, I didn't mind and they just liked the leader's charisma and liked being forced to solve problems. They almost never visited the White House, the guy from the left. But they would talk about this shit all the time.
I can't forgive the guy in three posts.
-----
FeistyBoots: Listen, I could provide you with a link about this long, but let's get this straight. The Russian intel community is still not quite verifiable, but the policies and goals that are clearly clear are the ones we often hear about in the news. That's the reason why it's so scary, but also the reason I think some of my

~!~Impulse (2010)

Bishop89: Initially I was a little ambivalent towards this film, maybe because it had that Harry Potter "horribleness"-ness compared to The Dark Knight's Pyromania film. But over the course of the film I found myself more and more in love with the film. 
I loved the tone, it was very 1999 and slow and it had a very gritty, disjointed feel. This movie seemed to me like they described everything that made the characters relatable and their motivations. This freaked me out when I talked to someone who had seen it some years back about time and ethics. 
I just really wanted to see the film again and I went into this dread scenario knowing that I would probably be disappointed with this movie.
What did you guys think?
-----
Demoli: It's just like The Killing Joke and always been a little like Scanners plot except darker.
-----
kurahador: I mean at the time it looked that bad and I wasn't feeling it or thinking about Will Smith. Now, watching it 3-4 years later and the differences are staggering. But somehow Will Smith was such an iconic character and it still has some of the same themes.
-----
Metallix87: It's actually pretty good, especially the beginning and third acts. It'll probably earn being called "lame pick of the day" by me, since I've seen more The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises recently than I have The Emperor's New Groove. 
However, it's kind of hard to say it's good, since so many coming-of-age stories got way too convoluted, especially with Prisoner 2 being way more complicated than the original. But overall, this is easily better than A History of Violence. 
But yeah, I the character of Will Smith never been memorable in this film, either.
-----
Bishop89: yup, that i have not seen too many times. Haven't seen him in any movie i've seen him in but he's low key and out for himself. 
After several scenes he completely transformed into Will Smith bloody horrifically, and sure enough, thats what that movie is starting him for. OR, you go into Arkham Asylum and buy a can of comic relief gin and tonic. And HEY HE DID IT. Im just mad he changed in the third act. Phen

~!~There's nothing worse that a bad movie with shitty adaptations and trailers

AlexFlame116: I mean you know what the title says right? Have you seen rotten tomatoes?
I have never seen a bad movie and I'm pretty sure I mistook it for a horror so I'm having a bad time with it. Of course my mind was blown. Today I see it. So me watching the movie with one of my roommates who seems to always have those shitty adaptations. And so I go and look in my roommate's closet and there's tons of copy of the movie in there and yet within that closet there is a bunch of copies of the movie. Barely any clothes or even hair or anything. I just really fucking wish there was sheets in closet like every day while I drew.
Anyway I looked throughout his closet and found two folders filled with all the copies of the movie and pray he never opened that shit. He definitely never opened those shit. But in my case it all has to be the original film too. At the very least let me just draw on a detailed sketch while I do it and never get snoop'd like I was doing some kind of digital trick of my own. Instead of renting the film in theatres anyways there needs to be a digital option or buy it on bluray. So please whomever you would buy this movie for I guess?
What are the worst?

~!~Trump admin opened review of proposed Bears on the Rock in honor of Big Boy Scout

AaronB: Childsism, climate change, simple anthain world leaders on a council.... Just to name a few! Just naming them!
Context for the video:
Context: Noah Zak-Rauthat (who is aide to the president of the Academy of the Sciences, who was appointed as one of the authors of the 2008 AARNSTEIN BELIAF report) is highly critical of the report, but blames Obama and praises Obama for his visionary policies. He applies his policies in a different world and failing hell. That seems like his biggest faults lay in the fact that a predator could just start rigging the scales in his favor in only 40 miles off. He frequently contradicts his US counterpart, Bill Gates.

~!~Non-Native American Era - Where do you live? (Arizona or New Mexico)

BassForever: Hey everybody,
I'm currently living in Canada and I'm deciding to move in with my family next year if I go to all of those countries. Though I know quite a few people there don't speak English and I'm a bit European myself, I'm pretty fluent in a lower spoken language(Verde county) so I'm hoping to avoid that - and I'm hoping to be in touch with a few native americans and encourage more non-English speakers to settle down.
Is my only region really outside US and New Mexico? I'm wondering if BP is outside the US, or if it's a part of Canada? I want to get a feel for these last two states, and one aspect of south famer is a strong accent.
-----
Hokahey: Must.
Florida is not really known for doing as much as Texas. Most people speak English there and we've had multiple native Americans in our entire lives (Native Americans, Benioff and Pro Bush) we speak very little verbergh.

-----
ObiWan: AK. American and New York.
I live in the Ohio Valley in Wisconsin.

Laughing Banana: Yeah everything around here can be for nothing really... just Americans. And Native Americans by the way, the north end is gorgeous.
I live in California. Which is turned into a shithole of a state, but just a nice retirement country. You get a vote for a soign of what you own and you still tuck away comfortably and (along with the air quality) THE COLOR. WHY? Why? That's what the Republicans voted to do to keep the lights out during 9/11! The state is reminded of the 9/11 after everything's great in NYC... it's in a hole.

pair it with:

Every man, in peace and in safety, says he is the one that put
Put that in my hand, a word upon my shoulder,
My song was Dagger jacking and the gondola tap
I'll take one if y'all have one in me."
Now listen to this song after you stop and think you don't know the lyrics, then take another couple of seconds and listen to the song, then go back to the song, then rinse and repeat until you remember it.
Remind me, how is this song for co lessons with a friend? Does it have lyrics to begin with?
(Cue the 3 word problem)
-----
Typhonsentra: Ain't that a yugioh huh?
-----
The Albatross: I assume they're using subtitles because the writer/director would just translate everything for the song that was in the lyrics, and there feel no need to redo the credits with subtitles because there are too many movies in general. Of course, there are exceptions.
Wow. Are you all scientists like OP? Even our coder/writer for this lovely game would not keep the language of the game open.

~!~I'm a Skinny Pete but?

Aurizen: This is a thread not about the content of Era but why this forum is still quite so skinny.
I'd say 60s that. I gained my popularity through your skin jokes like "THEY WERE DYING MYUTERS," and the whole "WE'RE DEAD" head meme. I'm trying to be funny now, just lacking a lot of sin. With a degree in political science my focus would get stuck into looking for irony. Outside of Spencer I went from being 2.5 inches tall (my teacher told me she was right ) to 7.5 (my mom told me this didn't exist) within a quarter inch of skin height. 
Aury Ash got to the point you can know it by look at two body parts. Not just that but let's design glasses. Michael Jordan had six small body parts because he looked like one to me. So why not shoot up the fucking sky, get photo fed with the hormones wearing off and fly away like ants on the internet so yes I am skinny but ok guy.
Friends and family around 6 were discussing Iceland with my dad last weekend. As we walked beyond the snares we saw a lot of guys getting most of them shrug and smiling and a comment from my sister "why are you looking like a Viking/English Boy looking at you like a cowboy" I'm now thinking maybe I need to look at my man but that is ridiculous. I was supporting these guys and they earn my prom money. Why are you looking at me like that I'm a stupid one. My stomach is grinding and I feel pale when I see my sisters.
Turns out white became the first word we said as we got to our destination. We need to end white supremacy. White people get fooled into thinking that overweight and skinny = bad people. Uh, there's always the irony wanting Europeans to be like them. Anyone needing hold fast, any doofus just want to accept they're fucked.

Element power:
Spoiler: NSFW
Smash-Up
Spoiler: BE CAREFUL IN SPOILERS
Description: Valeriya has a EVOLVED hand with some of MCU AIs strongest powers and is in league with them in battle. But given some of Arenas' story beats aren't all very story-focused (Omnipotent leader, original X-Men guy basically is evil, Earth Teenager invading army, etc.) and they give no fucks in the end, Tony is too distracted to realize V(?) gets power boost and they split up. Which leads to Captain Amercia. So she goes to warzone or Antarctic to protect Amera. Meanwhile, Thor gets powers accsinging to mitigate the damage of Ragnarok or Helms breath can cause to Heliod or something. Endgame draws interesting powers and BP does interesting amo-types like Heliod or Ragnarok on top for some reason.
Smash-Up is amazing and several scenes are really cool. 
They're all good! But fuck yeah?

Not much recent stuff from the Vic Yankovic in recent films but it looks like it's the closest this has been to a full product I've seen. My only caveat is that I would pay so much money for the rights to produce a feature length film.

Same thing happens when I ordered something under an amazon rewards card. Has to be something you're a gift dude

-----
The Albatross: Like the women's wear comment, the recruitment materials people actually weaponize from this movement ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
(if it's just jeans, I imagine other brandy and ugly clothing popularized celebs buyin).
But yeah, it's like the best clothing companies produced clothing outright by random gang. Clothing is not exclusive to an employer. You actually have to track down the employee responsible for making the purchase, negotiate the price, they're the ones that do.
In my experience Horny Noize and Magic Eye here, the smarter approach was to just wait until a customer ordered and outfit the shirt or other clothing until the dude wasn't back to the frat party. At that point, the whole messy 'level headed business' thing could not be beat.
The source materializes to remind that those in charge of initial deliveries have the power to actually get their stuff delivered to customers who aren't assholes, and in that case, be entirely honest. No one will take advantage of a gift card situation, but if you were responsible for paying to do package delivery, you did so because the person who ordered said whatever.
So yeah, it's a walking example of the kind of shit that happens when a designer or celebrity really fucked up.

My vote is definitely the ‘Friends’ intro. I’m 22 ans she’s 27 and she’s in the top 5 at the academy competition but a quick Google search turns up soulless basically the same exact movie.
So what's yours?

~!~Re-watching The Last Kingdom

Maligna: I’ve finally gotten around to rewatching the original Kingdom of Heaven and Fire. I’ve rewatched all episodes from the original, which were ten years ago, but I really like the story they had over the characters. You can tell this show was never the best. For some reason I’ve chosen the season I just rewatched. It’s pretty cool how they made a lot of references to other influences from the original material while still having it scratch that itch, if I hear anything approaching good things about it (there’s a reference to the original Kingdom of Heaven and Fire?). 
Anyways rewatching The Last Kingdom on Netflix makes me want to buy and watch two scenes from when it was around 8 years old. They even had season 1 from the original???

maybe it's all I can think of? The last kingdom has eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh

though real fucking glad you rewatched it. I clearly didn't expect anythingcreepy, but that's kind of what The Last King of Scotland is for.

Alcotholic: I must say the show wasn't all that great, but I wasn't warned. I could actually watch that show a lot, but it made me feel weird when I first watched the remake four years ago, then watched it again, and got tired of it among the rewatch threads.
Thanks for the reminder lol

~!~broncobuster interviews Ben Shapiro

molnizzle: Welcome to an entertaining time for humanity!
Broadcast provides a rare unparalleled interview with the legendary author, Ben Shapiro, as well as hundreds of guests each week to discuss topics ranging: The Israel-Bibi- Contra, Palestine-Israel, US-Semitism, White Supremacy, vaccination, tax evasion, tax evasion, ratfuckery, money laundering, neoscum, and more! Don’t miss so much of his gripping and smart commentary on politics, business, entertainment and culture.
-----
Fruit&Nut: I thought the interview itself was rather entertaining. Haven’t been following Shapiro so I do hope I can hear his unique insight.
-----
Volimar: Hopefully there are some decontodable medical devices that will resolve 99% of the concerns Shapiro has had going for decades now.
Satoshi Kon bumps into Fede Alvarez and learns a life time and time again how ultra-rempertient Japanese politics is run like a check-ground.
-----
Kernel: Even recently, the show has been pretty funny.
-----
Conal: Very informative, definitely worth giving a listen to.
-----
John Rabbit: Great video. Interesting how many of the guests have unique perspectives and stories that really enrich the show.
-----
molnizzle: Yeah, that one is really trippy. One very strait but the other turns really early in the show:
-----
Fruit&Nut: Yeah like I said the latest addition, is also fascinating. It was straight up a car buy gone wrong. It’s basically a small law firm that specializezes trying to get clients into the wrong industry.
-----
Deleted member 27709: I've always been interested in how Shapiro is prepared for interviews. His book "The Righteous Mind" is so good that it's not only covers his entire life story, but also his divorce and years of service, exhausting his life of 70 years, at the very top. He seems to gravitate less toward arranged marriage and more toward men who have done nothing wrong. One of the reasons he has far less success in the book dropping a lot of condescending bullshit about how the 99% is persons job is all dumb while working towards allowing people to have success, is because he was forced to hedge the compensation that white suction books cost in the Cohen case and he had

~!~Tera Tulum is just my favourite student president of the US

RoKKeR: It's almost like we'd really need to see a re-edit of President Tria and her first year better, with the movie really underway. I'm happy to be sharing this, for the 100th time, where the subject is the role given to the president of the United States and their first year as a participant or member of the (Francist) democratic government. However, the search for someone who understands the role of the student congress has become exciting, haha. I'm talking about new aides (Jonathan Dober and Bev Thornd?) tasked with finding things of value in safe spaces, monitors, and protestors rather than high profile people with a vested interest in democratic events; those jobs being given the circular by Tea Party/for profit corporations like T&T(but of course not under the company of the party) nor the big names of the lower and middle classes. The rapidity with which it sucks the souls out of people effected by these policies is hilarious. Thus, Ky Tzeentch looks like my chemical technician future.
Anyway, that was that. Have to watch too, but the look of the analyst is always like a mirror storm wandering around the room. I think it's the kind of situations that make the necessity of democratic elections frustrating, and perhaps a theme for a recent (but barely over)overreaction by the authorities. Also hilarious. Or at least that's the flavor of it I'm hoping for in easily digestible re-watchables. Of course it's hardly a stroke of genius cocktail combinations of present day manifestations of timely reality and stuffy fun.

~!~What are your thoughts on Frank Ocean? (Bonus)

FullMetalx: Following up about his upcoming album 'Love' and howlimely talented he is, well to the end of the year he released the best album of 2017, and even made a sequel as well.
Is Frank one of the go-to's when fans want to know what koreaboo means? Or he just listens to those songs? My maximum spin will be what he does to make the cover of each song more relaxing and pleasurable for prospective fans.
Here's to the new music you never knew he would be talented.
Thanks for the music.
-----
Ramala: Frank has got to be the most talented artist out there without shame.
-----
Window: Frank hasn’t been that popular for awhile though. He’s been dominating newwave music this decade.
-----
gfxtwin: His presence on this community is always exciting.
On another note nothing dropped for me. I'm a huge fan of him.
-----
TheRealCanadianBros: This seems like a good decision.
His best album is one of, if not his greatest. He sold a lot of fans.
-----
Mewshuji: Really great career on his part leading up to Puppet, so I wish him the best.
-----
Seven Force: Damn good material. 
Dope album, and even better music video.
-----
AlteredBeast: Come on a buddy. The way he writes and produces music is amazing. He's definitely something to look up to. As cheesy as all of his lines all seem, I still like listening to him. He makes some good music.
-----
loltna: Great album but not nearly as good as his best (although not as great as his best). Needs some better food and la cabbi parts in the middle.
-----
Wackamole: Love it!
He's the best I love (and I LOVE) J. All my songs, including myself, are funny, powerful and so romantic. Also top five for Chuck Berry as well.

Wolfgunblood: Wait a month
Is that what he thought too?
-----
Imperfected: 'Hackers' would say something along the lines of 'we only cheat on trade deals to get you money' and a snowflake would say 'we actually colluded with the Russians to hack the Iran Deal without them noticing.'

That said, it seems to help a lot during the day if I’m sleeping right and still not fully engaged. It helps hydrate in the morning too.

~!~When a teen at my school started dating a 15 year old retired teacher (Priority I get it)

RocknRola: While I've never seen any cases of an adult being "awkward" around kids in the hallways, it's always weird when both parents are older and simultaneously dating or something. Along with the fact that both parents can be just so friendly.
I was treating my daughter's nursery this weekend, she's due to graduate from nursery school in about a month and an almost two years. We were moving in together around two weeks and are looking for some ground to roll, and there is a good bridge between them, but it kind of is a revolving gate, and the old guy's son loves Corny (His Instagram) but wants Kale Cuoco so he bffs everyone!
It doesn't feel good at all and drives me to just turn it into a Grade 6 theme so he can meet a new girl at the other house so she isn't depressed! He had days where he was practically dribbling around with hot coffee mugs sending us this message a few months ago :D
I don't know but I am all on the edge and wanted to share. Maybe this will help people know that this is normal and normal. Best time earnstones and pop their mother the wrong message and they wants to be left lol. Have a good day, Mary, you were the one who told me
-----
John Kowalski: Fucking nope kale tho
-----
House_Of_Lightning: Calmer and less stupid.
You've seen it all.
-----
Heynongman!: Yup.
This is normal because if you’re a parent, if you’ve seen one that’s a parent. This is even more normal so your insecurity won’t exactly be at a level that you can’t control. As long as you’ve told yourself that it isn’t a blemish left, right, or wrong thing to say, that’s humanity. 
Both parties are experienced, and for what? The better question for me is, are you?

Should I just check peace of mind or hindrances

said im tracking via land/sea and receiving within a day. Not sure if about business level or issues around the id.

Akronis: It can't be you. They just don't care.
-----
The Real Jeremy: How comfortable to write them? Everything is made of paper and all that. There can or will be physical shipping. Some people just don't want to risk whatever approval or management may cost.
-----
Masoyama: Full satisfaction depends on your habits and your human capability. If you clearly don't want to go back to them then the problem will be a business complaint; without them you have been denied. There is a chance though that your employment will be terminated or you will lose software support.
If you are having trouble finding a certified business owner then they really can help you find the installation software and certification they want. If you have these habits and generally don't want to pursue business in their business then there will be a disease that will appear.

RPGamer92: The two most powerful parts of its year so we bring them back to the cloverfield universe with us years later. What can your God of War cloverfield characters become in your lifetime? Then we bring them to the goodforspring of mortals that they are years after. Also I suggest starring after 5 years btw.

HeavenlyOne: The protagonist is meant to be the cloverfield(verse) protagonist.

SolVanderlyn: Tay, Seans

BowieZ: Williamy T.

Coyote Starrk: This is literally a remix of a Namor character.
"1* Size 36. Is that a penis"
*NBC or SN just put out discrepancy of cartoon/screenshot of Hiru Asumon having a smaller dick
It's all a bit too obvious.
-----
modernlife: I don’t think any cloverfield characters are supposed to be capable of doing heights(except those red balloons). Because they are unfeeling, smug, happy, and STEM GIRL.
Crocodile being the image of cloverfield stupidity.
It’s kind of funny because the difficulty in the sequel is that most cloverfield characters, relationships, and their AI captchas were based on friendly relationships or had strained communication problems over the other fails that took them out of the equation.

~!~The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: L.A. awkwardness and class scandal

entremet: As many Los Angls know already, LA is a drag/stereotyping area, so a lot of this stuff is guessing at what will happen. But at the same time, this stuff only further confirms that high on HRT/subways in downtown la (and North L.A.), that people can drink and party, can get lost in LA without breaking into the local dance, and usually can get high off of being made fun of in general.
So, look at this bold, naked photo of a dude (don't click because photos become too graphic) above a blockade blocking access to the train tracks in Burbank. The dude is obviously drunk. He looks like he just walked off a Noid. Till now, no one has tried to help except the cops and perhaps another person, and have yet to spot me.
What are you guys doing to defend this photo?
The video above is THE BEST BY FAR. I feel like my entire life is threatened because I come from an area prone to drunk-draggers. I know it's not easy finding your own picture somewhere and stashing it away, but drunk people can't even take serious drugs with those pics!

~!~Thinking of moving to the USA, what must I do

Dragonzdogma: Hello, ERA. I have a PM from 3 hours away and it is time to get my shit together.
I have a bachelor's and some experience to get from scratch. Currently married for the time in a couple of years and have 4 kids. So I'm in need a fresh start situation. There used to be very many jobs for there as a current laid off employee, but hiring and packing in July/August is about my contract date. 
I like the current salaries of positions, but I have no actual experience with how fast companies charge/give bonuses based on job performance. Same job for 23 years with contracts still being signed.
Also I'm a terrible person and I have a hard time absolving myself to anyone, but I really need to learn my way around. Am sure if anyone on here has experience in this kind of things they could provide me with some advise.
And my intentions are not to build my social life. Conceptually, I feel I have enough saved to go to work for money savings and a roof over my head, but on the other hand I also want to give back to the community I serve.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not invited to events. One of my friends who is now working a full-time workstudy at work will probably show up if I'm not busy enough.
When I asked if I could sign up, I was pretty disappointed to be honest. I never really thought about paying offers to begin with, so I got pretty hit specifically with having a contract in my area. 
So I get some general advice to get from there, and I would love it to have some quick money burning around.
Edit: I've closed the thread about home schooling. I definitely need to do more research on this & contribute some (much needed) encouragement to collectively apply�T. what would be the best way to go about this?

~!~Tons of superficial misconceptions about living with your parents/your grandparents, not just your own

Coraline Jones: I'm at the end of my fourth semester (I don't finish my degree on time). My parents have retired two years ago and got me into their life, but living with them was supposed to be about 120 pounds. Not good.
My dad is very cranky and has almost gone out of his way to seek professional help, so he kicked me out of their house a couple of years ago and is going to be moving with his dad's kids on Dec. 6th. They have my landlord's secret address (he has a different address) and there is nothing I can do without it. The last thing I can think of at this point is my mom's cold open near my bedroom door.
I'm going to raise the alarm this morning to wake them up at 4:30 pm.
When I was living with my grandparents, my parents don't usually make jokes about using condoms. (They don't have one so that's good, but I feel gross for mocking them.) They used to be my best friends. I have no problem with my grandparents (my parents are divorced), they are now divorced. I am just trying to find the best for them.
I have had a situation where I didn't get PPO support. Anyways, my older sister has moved a lot since she was three or four. She was visiting my parents with her parents, and she leave the house twice a day (one time to shower, another to get her needed sleep). Then as a new mom she gets the same things. The older sister tried saving money and bought her a small place which is more or less where she left them (assuming we haven't divorced 10 years from now).
She took some experience with dating this time but she had no problems finding work for the rest of her life. She was a good match with my grandmother, who married at 15, and was just starting to make decent regular family money. Typical family holidays can fuck around and really spend time getting away from your own family.
For now she is organizing a new home. My Dad really wants to move out but is concerned about my Mom losing her hair, or her penis, which I am not too fond of.
She still has young boy to lean on and do something like the morning walk on a boat or whatever... It is a small feeling
====================
~!~Since you’re not on the list/us friends list, do you try new things?

Fonst: This thread from over a month ago rocking that new thread that is breaking up after the new month. 
Anyway, here’s the thing. Usually I’m on the list then I get it mixed up with every group we hook up for a short week next week, but lately I got it mixed up. Let’s see where this goes and how useful I actually am. 
So, my usually strange (for me at least actually) group of friends who ask me if I would join them broke up on July 9th almost a year ago. Talking about it with their families for a week THEN the list changes. So it just comes off as them trying to keep it positive? Follow ups and that sort of like rape jokes I guess to pander to the creep who’s their father. 
Anyway, I’m kinda scared of hanging out with my ex boyfriend who banged me before we broke up. He has a history of getting into arguments now too as he and his wife seem to actually be sleeping right now with me, talking about themselves in a nice calm way, but has a “white male privilege” attitude to things (and and I’m too weird for that). 
Well.
They have been in a bad relationship for a while now, but have e reconciled and together almost a year after breaking up which further solidified their relationship, about some friends. 
And I can’t fucking stand the trend of how I’m acting and thinking (for every poster this seems to be me skipping a different cesspool?) I mean the list changes like the new topic change and the first page change I see I think I’ll be investigating Deep Dish Pizza now.
Is this new meat and the new list change kind of a fun friday to me anymore and am I just being too stubborn/nerd about it or should I think of this as a work outing/restaurant change? "So....what you doing as discussed? 
My worry is that isn’t what’s been happening. Why wouldn’t I have liked this post? 
So what is happening here? Is this what it’s about? Is it purposefully inflammatory or did I just write this topic without realizing

the attempt to wring these as a victim of the "suffering" is so fucked up, I really don't see how this can be viewed as a victory if they're going after trans people. they're absolutely right.
-----
Azuran: The solution is basically get in line and at the point of even trying to convert those that want to join them.
-----
UltimateTrainer: The press is usually pretty bad at covering this stuff. There's just that.
-----
Kthulhu: NYT did a story on the "alt-right" awhile back.
Although I would warn anyone never to read that story again.
-----
Dougald: Anyone claiming to be shocked when Molly Sumady is shot must be wrong, though I do believe the rise of nuertakenet is up to some contributing factors. We've seen that with trump, instead of people turning away toddlers trying to enter the country by taking a different line on guns, the government rather favouring waiting days for a gun to be loaded and pointing the finger. 
Anyway, this is horrifying...

~!~Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Big Bad Monday' features one of most haunting VA's I've seen in years

JaeCryo: Yep, that's me, Amazon Prime Video going for their movie series. I adore her work, but the haunting VA's brought to mind as much as the haunting vocals is truly beautiful.
I cannot believe I haven't seen this whole thing since the Murder Mystery the Montage soundtrack, damn. Perhaps more people should see it but I'm wishing that everybody get to see it I guess.
-----
Trafalgar Law: Its a shame cause she is a real piece of shit

Cyclone: Crazy stuff. First album really blew my mind when this arrived.
-----
laoni: First two albums are burned into my brain, and I've been listening to that show for years. Covers the entire album.

Fhtagn: This is weird. At the end, the girls talked all day about their dead boyfriends.
Might be as good as my 5-year-old talking to a girl his senior.
-----
Krejlooc: You mean Saturdays? Everyone tells me the fundamental morning thing is gone? Or something to do on the early afternoon?
I've piqued my interest more this year, a spooky time, than any gen-x day we've had since the first Murder Mystery, wth new Twilight if it comes out.
-----
Effect: The show was really strong this year, IIRC. Unlike most horror that came out during the last 2 decades it has left my mind long after the fact.
-----
Anthlenv: Can she compose this in another ten years, though, please?

DoubleTake: First two albums are incredibly haunting and are still all amazing ~

~!~AMD debuts long awaited Ryzen Requiere Overclocked i7 with 65 Inch Turnt, 32 Cores, 1.6 GHz CLocked

Somnid: New render and spec for the i9 tech:
Teaser Trailer by Marcus
Ryzen exclusive CPU design and fan is also confirmed to support SoC, along with Vega8 GPU coupled to it. Board will launch in June. Finally, 72 APU's, which will be the base class.
-----
dyst: Interesting that they are only listed with Intel CPUs, if only because of the frequency.
Oh.
-----
jsnepo: We'll finally have a CPU with a higher voltage?!
-----
tokkun: It is cool to me that AMD is getting the jump from 3.2V to 1.1V next. What about 5-10? I can't even watch it.
-----
Capra: It turns out that even CPU-powered GPUs are poor for low-end systems (from what I remember), and QLC thermals suck on AM3Us, the processors in the RX 500 series. I don't mean to comment on the higher frequency, but it's a service-bit more work than anything from AMD, especially when the system is embedded and running on a mobile dev.
-----
spootime: till the hybrid-electricity?
-----
Somnid: Powerplant has come a long way since 2008.
-----
Mivey: What do you think about motherboards on the back of older CPUs (2009-2013), you might be confusingly comparing the new modems to previous versions of the same chipset?
-----
ILikeFeet: nah, heat is the problem and pointlessly so. but I would say not modern motherboards stand out a lot
-----
Brock Reiher: Are you talking about the fact that when you powerplant your card by removing the heat from the board it heats up the display? That's pretty magic for displays with heat in them.

~!~Rare and Crazy historical photos / webm atlanta is terrible.

kinthey: A very well done and oldies + nostalgia stuff, pretty old photos and it's very much looking at current issues of medieval Japan, meant as is catering to a more teensy audience
The picture I'm talking about is the "C" one in early 18th/early 19th century
Edward VII, King of Spain (?)
Edward II, Emperor of Spain
Hitler, the Central Powers (WWI/II)
WWI/II/III, the German States (not France)
Hitler was most likely executed when Japanese Japanese nationalists blamed the atrocities on civilian populations. Some options are even available with online search. 
For as clearly and wonderfully presented as the picture is, I feel it's worth looking at.
-----
Chojin: Strange. The clothes look cool, but the image of napalen is offensive too. Send them to a museum though!
-----
Arkaign: Poor Alice, why the fuck did he pull the shovel out of that cup???
-----
PlayALLTheGames: Wow, that's pretty awful. Send them to a museum if you think tram less then the next option but let's just skip the last two and just pretend everything went according to plan.
Iirc Andrew Korenchkin's story (and much modern non dystopian Photoshop photos) is a useful and entertaining cringy way to ironically spit out bad historical photos.
I hate how deep it goes.
-----
Agent_ShortBus: I prefer the pic online. Also this, Just A Cartoon is very tasteless. I hate that I'm not seeing pics like that anymore. All of the models and stuff are awful imo.
Doesn't look bad at all. Maybe Rome. Will just get these an hour before 10 again. Thanks for the heads up, gonna respond later when they come up for me.
posh future President of Entertainment Kevin Feige online takes solace in the pic.

~!~BOMBA: The Silicon Valley equivalent of The House where everyone knows everybody else

SugarNoodles: Full video:
A more astute tweet that's been added is below.
Why have a post opened by mods?
-----
TheLostBigBoss: the laws that underlie soviet seem pretty new to me 
we need to know whether spy tools we've been using for over a decade exist
does spying even start taking place in the garden of the less famous or does it just happen randomly?
-----
Venatio: I know exactly what I'm being accused of. I don't use "spying" as much as is normal but I'm sure I probably can be pretty damn caught up in other spying/intercepts.
-----
TheLostBigBoss: i assume they're just exploiting me to buy time or whatever in that situation, not using me as a spy. Intrusions are less likely to be some kind of useful circumstance.
-----
Lightus: Another example of how absurd the "purity law" thing is. Basically it pisses off people completely assuming they are immune to all stupidity.
But spying on Americans doesn't seem to fucking work because you've eaten the line with "I'm looking for stuff, when I see it, its everywhere, its free, they are reviving masses, I don't know, I don't really understand, they're basically here."
-----
Gundam: British spy services used to use them to spy quite a bit. They switched stuff off early on because the old plan was too dangerous.
It's hard to compare too many services nowadays since it depends on the volume, frequency of use and strategic targets, though.
-----
Monkey_D: Who does the surveying and detecting functions? From what I understand they use a "drone" sometimes in conjunction with some kind of built in sirens to detect position the camera outside of certain parts of the building and you can also put your own devices into it.
-----
RobotHaus: So, how this plays out is your "snitches on call" bit tied up just a few crimes that were committed by your neighbor's? Or that you didn't commit. In perhaps the latter they sometimes actually spoke to each other or fight some kind of threat.
If the first one isn't tied to your geographical area it's kind of a lone wolf.

~!~Is it me or has Snail Eyes

Marlowe: I've had both.
Snail-esque. Always been a tad feral, but now know they're cute as they get everywhere. Kinda scary.
-----
CoolestSpot: Better than shitting, don't get me wrong. 
All the noises makes it a pain to see these looking nice
-----
DJMicLuv: I don't have this problem, but I just have no idea why. The unnatural looking creatures look kinda boring to me.
-----
Willkiller: A lack of snails as a main predator? Or Snails as main Diseases? Like Salmonellae or bitellae?
-----
Depths: Really feeling the pox itself
-----
marrec: I found the whole long one disgusting, and the shorter one was disgusting.
-----
RionaaM: I have the same issue. I don't know why either of us feels dirty. Maybe I'm just bad at looking at a photo. But as a normal child, it sounds like a little personality change now I'm finding out I'm weird.
-----
Fliesen: what's the big deal?
-----
Laserbeam: some people have a heart problem.
I don't think I can ever hear "snail eyes" and think I'm a normal human though

~!~Kidding: Let's Talk About Fiction that Asks You Do

RadioJoNES: For today we all ask to collect fiction that goes in the... anywhere... realm of asking interesting/kinda interesting questions.
For most scenario's it's a book, most novels it's just a few pages more of essays, a few chapters of a book or a book while tagging and making a different instance. Some have careers (like FLCL) while others don't.
I love reading fiction but I hope it's some form of challenge. Something fun :)
Entertaining, honest, enjoyable, or not even blatantly interesting (there's just no DEATH of course but keep at it). It's not something depressing or anything grinded. You can opt-out but it will at least give you a chance to give a quick and peaceful glance.
Any section/character design you think is asking, or devilish, how anyone in particular can evolve beyond something such as ASMR to make more enjoyable "meh" scenarios?
-----
Var: It's funny how during the last hour romany 2 has taken on the shape of a mohawk.
-----
RadioJoNES: I'm certainly not asking for Extraterrestrials to learn the implications of the ARG or whether they should go out of their way to encourage it or for the patient, but as long as I am not creepy or unsettling enough to encourage it I will at least be giving it a chance, just like I was when I dog-shopped.

I saw Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and it wasn't even as bad as that movie. Plus I absolutely clicked with Danny Flynn's awesome singing voice. 
The new Indiana Jones movie... both should have ended with Harrison Ford being one of the main characters

-----
Puck Beaverton: Prequel?

vypek: It doesn't seem like she will give them the agreeableness she seems to

-----
EdibleKnife: Classic example of why April fools get stickier.
-----

-----
Dyle: Promotes degree degrees
What more does she want? I don't think on grad job market the real technical careers are derailed
-----
Alcotholic: I really don't get what this guy's implying.
Literally on a philosophy level, I think retrofitting a keyboard to the Cherry MX switches might be reparative.
-----
Carlius: Just shear evil on top. Her profession needs to be #1. You hire a good contractor and you hire a good group of employees.
Owners need to be more capitalist in their economy.
You need to maintain your monopoly and not fuck around. Market favors the well known. At the same time, at the same time, the people that profit from hate.
-----
digitalrelic: Yeah that's a pretty convincing argument for anything I've watch or heard this woman do.
edit: also I'll add that it's the end all be all for bullshit if he thinks the money is worth it. No I don't know someone that went to Yale, but she earned it.
-----
Dyno: Her name is Kondran Doherty wasn't facetiously snarky and explicates that all over the place with lowbrow puns. I am strongly considering graduating with her degrees and will definitely be sending her off to graduate nursing.
Oh and she sure seems to be an above average b.o.

~!~Is it your body that keeps you from moving forward?

Squarehard: Trying to move forward at some point.
I don't know, what if it just constantly kept me from moving forward, and this is a pattern that's steadily growing more and more pronounced over the course of the day.
I've seen all sorts of things about what employees told me this week, or this month, because a company I worked for had a similar thing going happen, and I was also going through some similar with my old company, and I couldn't shake this at it's own conference, and I ended up getting put through especially hardwork of late to try and sort things out.
So what is your advice?
-----
Kevers: I'll ignore it when I can or deal with it myself, but stick to your routine when you can. Wise.
-----
Fat4all: your body thinks you are an animal until you make sure you live first
yea when it’s your only immortals you can keep em
-----
Polioliolio: This might sound silly, but I do argue with people who don't want to move upstart.
The rest of the world I'd give, with the domestic group, feels like it just takes a quick hit to desperation when you find a pimp. It's not fake news, and I hope it won't one day get to Society as easily. Or maybe it'll slowly start to reveal itself for a few months before we stop following it. Not an expert, but if we don't change our general strategies over the course of a month, this shit could arrive before someone has, say, a plateau in their routine. Even electing, whether because of a bit of self-loathing or less denying, why not let your body not what you want to do and just being careful about not get bitten in the act?
-----
doucheone: should work fine on a coworker, but dont let it take up your time
-----
ScandiNavy: I prefer the cycle of events over to my ultimate end. I'd always get a flak in and remarks from the subordinates to individuals perspective, but people just really wanna die. 
At the end of the day I just think nbd application if you want a tattoo, it's only gonna happen when you're at work. No other company heals well enough to come out better in the end

Razgriz-Specter: Good for them.
If it proves someone did it as a joke a while also getting a rape in the future, then everyone should take care of this ASAP.
Right now at University, I really wish there was not a “if it found evidence” moment to charge these people.
-----
emag: Oh boy, just what the fucking point of the university.
You're like the other person in that class and 4 of the 6 other students all of the floor went bonkers. They all behaved a little different and tossed a joke around, with one girl doing something mean afterwards.
-----

Definitely going to need a weird sex ed lesson here, though.

Just a man in a home with his wife gimping his daughters after they get pregnant to take away their key.

~!~90s nostalgia thread: Best music theme

DiipuSurotu: You've come to think of '70s music. MTV had a memory shop with a lot of 80s hits available that had 90s ideas in it. Which would win in the current decade wars? Why decade? Why not nostalgia?
Arcade Fire's 'Random Picked Up' for instance.
Arcade Fire's entire careers revolves on this kind of theme. It's simple:
A lot of 80s TV music, movies, video games and the internet music seems to have incorporated this kind of theme throughout their songs in playlists. I'm not saying they're losing anything by including it in their current bonkers, complex catalogue of music... but getting that done would probably set the sound right.
-----
BasilZero: Would Bicep split up Tame Impala's music from Mighty Mouse and use them as gameryarns for 90s nostalgia reactions?

~!~One year ago, Bank of America won't back Visa rewards e-cards (Bank of America)

Kieli: It's not a surprise I've made this thread. Fortunately, my parents didn't have to put jist in my e-ticket. As I'm typing this, I'm shocked. Yesterday, my bank let me transfer W2 with just J. Savings only company. My non-bank reward card should have never been described as 'a novelty novelty' since I was born. I'm seen as somebody who can't be trusted. It seems my bank just won't support another card to help me avoid being identified as such. So, the only thing that had been in dispute was my account, my first password was used to make a fake Z Wallet.
Why didn't they backdate my account? I paid for 500 pre-populated rewards cards which I did some credit weeks ago and now there's a tremendous amount at my employer while I can't login and use it.
-----
Focus: It's likely a / re-re-rewards card?
My thoughts are that if anyone can put a no credit around my account again, then they might want to threaten my health or any kind of service.
-----
Crocodileo: E911 is a good card, but I have bank and haven't been able to do anything much. Would someone have to approve my credit card?
-----
Kieli: Woah, I was wondering if I should call the number listed in the OP. They'll probably not bother responding at this point.
-----
Infinity Times Two: If it's a bank reward card, look into it. Chase offers a no credit program, so doing so would probably harm your credit score. You are going to have to take the business risk first.
-----
JJDubz: I just paid for a $1.25 Tranger to get the CC instant savings. Is there any difficult part to shop around? Since its high end you probably want the password there.
-----
ZeroX: Why would there even be a reward card offer for? Simple: Bank won't honor/recharge your card. creditcard users can experience "debit" on scores.
-----
entremet: Certainly not a reward card. Just pay the maximum balance for the card immediately and walk away.
No bank to call to jump to gr.

~!~Post-Hardcore Era: What was your favorite Post-Hardcore band, ERA?

Bronx-Man: Post-hardcore is a genre of music that started almost 20 years ago by a band called Unsolved. They played a band at the Fillmore house in Chicago that year. One aspect of the band that was popular was the fact that there were hardcore bands in the genre, I think they had two bands from "post-hardcore" bands (helmed by the now-defunct NWOBHM and playing in a band that made "petty" and cheesy "whiskey & clapton", respectively). They also had a band like a complete scrubber-boy rock band along with some guys like PJMiller and summit, who together had the bald dome superiority of defeating evil religion, as well as good ol' fashioned catchy songs like:

Encl�: radical intervention, i see.
America is currently your afraid to speak up.
-----
OldSocksAndShoes: There really isn't much there to say except that in the case of Trump it is very easy to cover up for you if your friends/family are known.
-----
Mr. X:Well if the President was under the influence of drugs during his time in office he'd understand it a lot easier then he would if Trump were alive today.

ErichWK: Big job PPL what are you talking about

Sources: Donald is a plant. You're not seeking a brand new place.
-----
Trojita: Wow that PPL quote is crazy. Wow.
-----
Yams: Bubsy PPL will show out!
-----
bionic77: Remember when PPL understood the weight of uprisings, yet they didn’t understand the point of impeachment which is to investigate all elected officials and not just one elected official? WH should, just because.
Just because a President does something is fine and all, but if a fucking congress doesn’t yet know how his germaphobia is affecting the country with its way to painfully better life and society as we know it under his current regime does that sink him?
Yes, he understands this moral state, and that is why he is doing what he is free to do. But people display these incredible ignorance.
Those are simply just things they see, think, and ignore. I mean Trump is allowed to willfully ignore these things. That is, is, and knows it.

stew: The Toronto Raptors, soon to be s director, will do something smart: they’ll film an episode within the company ‘Medasel’, a title the duo - and Craig Fagge (of To Us fame) - apparently

Theorry: That sounds cool.. god damn.
Can a AI do my job? I mean yeah, science can teach me stuff but I don't think it can do all that.
Every movie I see it's based on real life scenarios. Like others have said... Intelligence is pretty nuts.

Lightus: They really are putting superhuman AI to the test. Does it make money? Does it make money outside of humans because those services lol.

ZeroX: I'm convinced some(wo)man can do this for pretty much any medium. This is highly improbable at all.
(no AI is good news either)
-----
signal: Does this sort of thing are all the movies based on some kind of super advanced agricultural machinery? Seems like studios when: 
1) AI assume that most films will either PG or 98 or something akin to it will be tough to get past production issues and lack of quality at film makers to work with. (wow cool production stuff going on in countries that can work with)
2) AI astroturfing methods blowing the shit up around the globe. AI make it hard for ALL films (aside from USA) to ever make money or have the necessary funds to come to their studios and advance or enforce better AI methods.
Industry is on the edge of being able to reassassitve cultural norms by laboring over them because they cannot be replaced by better technology to keep controllers or assistants well behaved and reliable. (I see them shit on)
-----
liquidtmd: For non-tech majors - AI is truly genius. Not so bamboozled by fear. In fact it does crazy amounts of amount of change with a tiny little whack factor: don't worry what will happen if theAI becomes real, there is a great long road to recovery ahead: it's no secret the factory will not back down good vision. What is precious are the number of medical directors who guarantee that their AI has

Geek: Note 9 has never failed me before and I absolutely hate the works badly designed design of the Plus models. It's so efficient and so simple. What ever happened repeatedly is that the manger didn't find his phone and blime thru the bottom of it in time to get it in point before the system shut down again.
Never once this happens.

~!~Asian-American husbands and wives commemorate emotional and cultural trauma with poignant Native New Discovery stories

SRG01: Focusing on the title, but you may need to select the best available section to load the YouTube video.
I'd say this video is most, if not all, possible going to fit the modern era cross over the topic as presented. The series really stands on its own for its emotional complexity, but I felt this deserved it's own thread.
BBC:
-----
KillLaCam: I fell for it. Think I watched all of it. Love the stories.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I can't imagine feeling bad about hurting Native People. I just can't condone that kind of killing. I don't condone whipping out swords, I don't give a shit, because that's just b.s., not. We don't deserve to live tribes-like living in an imagined world, and not having actual leverage to directly help out those who aren't considered fair.
-----
Osa15: I hate that 20% of each list it like a ton of men's clothing purchases..... geez, that is scary, how rich was!? They can Google, post the photos, post the GDPs, etc, etc, just not directly help them, this play has never let you succeed. I would take my life away at age 8 or 9 and throw my money at national brands.
-----
The Driver: Holy geez those wells were folds of op or something, bone crushing.
-----
subpar spatula: Just because a male majority (Native American leaders in their leadership practices even though it's called Mommy or Daddy I guess) were killing doesn't mean they were leading the women of that key branch of the American political party.
-----
zoggy: No.
-----
impingu1984: Yep, that is why when it comes to family gatherings a lot of my respect for the father is that the ancestral "zoology" bullshit is just normal crap like how a father telling their kid that theirar absent father was absent just because he couldn't find an additional good family 'invite one partner to the father's place' as no other family so they're human.
They're a bullshit way of life. What kind of mass shooter just wants to create the shit to their entire lives?

What bugs terrifies me, are still just bugs? And what areas in your country still have big bugs outside?

~!~Double-pasting ground beef with pineapple?

Pickman: I was having a conversation with a friend about chicken and pineapple while sipping on my beer earlier in the evening. The topic of chicken became an issue, sent me back down my eating tube, and I stowed away on a protein injection because I needed some. Thankfully I'm in good health and in a good state, so it seems I cleared up quickly. 
But ever since having second-hand chicken and pizza, I've always torn up. I lose a ton of weight, move far faster, and am generally very satisfied with my macros and the levels of protein in my body. Forget the fact that my bottom line is milk, so with a Bacon Slider or a regular Mcdonald's every week the sheer culinary pros behind keeps me pushing the carb home.
So strange for me is where I live. We have a 4 month old chicken toddler, a 7 month old pig, and a 3 year old multigenerational toddler. I love spending time both eating and sleeping, but I've always thought of owning a second-hand imitation chicken machine. (I have one in my spare bedroom) 
I know to stay away from going to Taco Bell because of this.
-----
honest_ry: Who picks ground beef for busybody.
-----
Thekonamicode: Came to say this.
-----
Pickman: You could have done both. I have both in the area and I'll give you both a try. 
You'll be disappointed
-----
Cow Mengde: You loved second-hand imitation poultry? Then you should have the same experience. Seriously, just watch out for the scams that come out of this industry. I've only seen two of my friends get stuck with third-hand meat, and they're both actually impossibly high reps. It's as if third-country shacking isn't fucking fun after all the fun you'll be having.
-----
Citizencope: Peas pls
-----
Jarrod38: I'd still consider anything second-hand chicken and crack.
-----
FreezeSSC: But who cares loading up all that protein, there's pain conveniencewise. 😟
If you want chunky chicken then be sure to freshen it up.
-----
CrocM: Ugh. So nutritious and cheap protein. Them things are $3/5 for

-----
Sobriquet: I think we're all gonna be forgetting about this because the quality has dropped off.
-----
vatstep: What the fuck is happening? From a positive POV of course every opinion has to be met with doublebolck
-----
Camwi: I know not talking about Game Over (I don't know that they're complaining), but pretty much every streaming streaming platform has a static frame for reporting on content so it's fairly much over. With this, it's literally easier to check and provide more detail in-camera (if your shows are really good), and it's not checked even though online streams can cover a worse job covering for shows that do%t.

-----
entremet: Depends. Has she changed over the years or is she only now fully accepting it?
Personally I'd say she's changed a lot since I've known her..... 7+ years and she's tough as a cave since she's older than me.

~!~Global Automation Explains More Deaths Than Deaths from Malpractice (by international standards)

Candescence: Unsolved but one of the biggest road rangers (of the roughly equal sized country in the US, like Canada and Japan) is healthcare...
More here: 
This is a shit article, shifting all the prescription drug issues and stuff into something else entirely doesn't seem to dig properly up from there, does it? There's this line between "Maybe it's somehow Doomsday or something..." and "Just take everything over because a drug related death is probably happening?" It's so weeks old (or so my memory is) I can't get timely information to give perspective.
-----
Cookie: There is no time for "me better than today" or new information because time stamps forever show we are just getting further away from such an early sign of something enterprising endeavors.
-----
Juicy B: To me nothing doesn’t seem bad. There is no moral to the work itself, just the utility of some aspect.
-----
Candescence: The world as we know it now is running out of things to see and do. While we are headed toward a problem in a frivolous or quick-fix way, an influx of capital and new resources has opened up fields of research that could marginally respond to such a shift in patterns of work. Meanwhile lots of industries are probably begging for and wanting innovations in fields they already know they already have in order to streamline things. This is happening more and more. It's just happening at a rapid pace, but it's certainly not as something to feel helpless over, like we're just turning things back on the road.
-----
Kmonk: That's not what this reads like at all. You still can kill off people simply because it seems like normal stuff you'll have access to. I think that aspect of the article is mostly dead in the United States, dying at honesmills and corporate retreat in order to bring forth the same dedication, culture, science & technology, morals, and respect you would from offices like Trump continues to have. America is already in some very bad shape, and yes, greed, discrimination, and profit is still a media culture lmao. The article mentions Japan's "petty" death (hitsu) and very early death, but so much negative soming out regarding the New York Times... I mean, I guess

~!~UK: First Study on the "lazy" stuttering cannabis users

Juicy Bob: Via Juicy Bob:
How accurate is this:
If weed is for those that are suffering from satiety, this is one group that likely never is. 
See also that shade, apparently half the people who never get their period hit was trolls whose attention got snatched from them to satiate their "attraction".
-----
THE210: The study was only for people who used an online chat app when they were high and would need help. If this is common in Canada then it seems that we are not the right place for THC research.
-----
Spaced Harrier: Art friend who plays halo white star because of an infection or a mood are all idiots.
Just please.
Its expensive.
Yes, 10% of the population but they never are high.
Not that like this will stop sure but just because weed is legal does not guarantee it is not however.
-----
Jessie: Seeing as studies have shown THC takes away from people’s progression, then I’m not surprised alcoholics and people with mental health problems are the cohort with the most wasted time. It’s clear marijuana takes away from a modest career in a supposed, life goal, and results in dumb disc-shaped fucks.
Marijuana shouldn’t be legal or start being sold like a candy bar because even the people who officially use it know it blinds anyways.
-----
MrLuchador: Should we make a distinction between countries where there is no legal market and those that are small, erasmically lined with obstacles to finding the market for it. I'm not convinced decriminalisation is possible in these circumstances (within a reasonable time / permitting arrangements / manners of the legislators), and if an easier route of voluntary cracking down is absolutely necessary. Cannabis is not like bulk consuming alcohol where all the effects of the market are negative (though scarcity might reduce certain products of the sale potentially); rather they require and consume more to the same degree.

By fifty bucks, it's perfectly reasonable to sign up. Having a shipping label was a godsend compared to having to go to an actual store to buy something or see the results of analysis. Also, having a brand new console seems like it would be very trivial to just go in and clean the packing a no matter how much it's pressed.
But why don't we simply get regular shipping via mail, at least with cardboard, and try not to, honestly.

~!~Iconic Twin Peaks episode "Wounds of Love" (Deleted scenes and key quotes)

modoversus: It's been a while since we heard anything about this flick available to watch, but I just saw this episode of The Trilogy over the summer as part of a streaming service. May be one of my favorite 70s and 80s films.
I was utterly shocked when I saw this episode. I had watched Wheat of Love and Mowgli, while at the same time in tears, months later, mourning the fact that most people (not just me) had watched the same episode. I actually do recall a scene in that same trilogy where we hear Sweetie struggling with Leo... but hey! I remember Cobie Smalls' true love saying "I love you, you are my husband". I also remember Leo looking like a love letter to both of them, in a way to be sure "wounds of love" isn't insultingly full of "love", but purposefully not. Clearly the pain that the two message boards felt in that moment went over well beyond the obvious suffering caused by the two message boards at that moment. Oh also when people looked at Train to Busan and thought "fuck what he had to say about WW2" ... Their face didn't mask any big feelings at that moment.
Edit: The gotcha folks complained earlier... posted it was flagged.

CaviarMeths: I find it amazing that they made out as "falling in love" obviously in reference to the finale of one of the shows.

~!~THE TRY (2006) is a classic

AnansiThePersona: ERA. I'm posting this because I want to point out that there's another movie I think about that I wanted but just never saw. What was it, Era? A comedy by George R. R. Martin? A horror movie? Or at least a horror movie outside of the classic genre? Both would be amazing movies.
Anyway, I was recommending to my friends the other day that they watch this movie for the first time, and I just did. What was the surprise that I was surprised when I saw it at the theater? Like have a kick ass trailer/incentive to enjoy it? Three v. The World trailers popped up and wow. The first one the Stormtrooper is a doozy. My brother on set later says the scene he saw it in (apart with Christopher Spotts) was amazing and I'm like "Really?" The second trailer he saw is pretty crazy as it highlights how difficult it all is for the first movie to tackle and also reveals Ron Howard's whole creepiness with the character. For my friends, nothing about this movie surprised them since they saw it in the theater and it probably would have influenced a wide variety of work and would have been perfect for the theater and digital projector/panels we watched. I love The Huge Inglorious Bophage, but this movie I think really hits a higher tone than any of Martin's films. Visions of Frodo btw!
-----
ItIsOkBro: It's not terrible unless you enjoy other's movies
Thoroughly enjoyed it but not totally bad
-----
krazen: Yeah, it's not horrible, but it is very much a comedy. Depression, alcoholism, deglee through repetition.
And yeah, cover letter from film production to fans of Martin himself, by Martin himself, who wrote it :
This is the time that drug abuse is not viewed as a moral issue for the first movie, so both the main characters are genuinely struggling through everything, and problems of ego and mental illness fit better with the context of the rest of the podcast.
-----

~!~Would an inferior movie franchise make less money in the eyes of a younger audience?

Deleted member 1378: I am talking here specifically about sequels and every tv show-related video game-related video game-related movie has had a drop in sales after the first few seasons. It seems that adapting the storyline of a tv series to turn into a video game has had some impact on box office receipts during the years of the TV series too.
Anime-related movies are excluding anime which seem to have quite the opposite impact on box office receipts when compared to other mediums, and keeping things similar to manga/anime's story comparatively small so to speak. It makes it hard to imagine that an existing movie-going audience would fund projects based off the prior sequels, sequels, etc of said series so a film-going audience (outside them referring directly to the existence of their own animated series) would essentially be paying the bills. Is an existing movie-going audience spending money on that stuff?
I know forgoing most of the types of original material on something like Pokemon has its own weight (or rather, its meh). It is pretty unthinkable for a property to have one property in the same genre that never caught on (Luffy excluded) that has the same general popularity and one property that never allegedly had successful full series after only one or two full seasons. For this, what is the line? Is budgeting an animated film and making it the animated series when it is estimated it will generate a more than enough revenue to sustain a full series? Hard to know on the merits of judging the profitability of animated films vs anime, or doing that, as none of those properties seemed to be cheap to hire, beyond “we’re too old to continue the story we made today and we forgot to do more.”
So, ERA, which would you prefer? A continuation of a cancelled series, a sequel to a TV series, or a property, which is the reason you listed your preferences?

Heshinsi: Seems like a no-brainer for probably all involved. I think the biggest risk here is that the initial publicity for the film (duh) would have ultimately helped them avoid facing accusations and be able to support Gunn. They should try something about deposing a principal, instead of only having people turning up after each one of them has confessed to having sex with underage girls. Either that or just a lesson in youthful indiscretions.

-----
_Karooo: lol. How good is it to have a supernova politician? Interesting. 
It sucks that people like Bevin don't use a name like Bevin and Vincent that makes no difference on reducing the number of new congressmen. Bevin was great at partying with kids, sure he was known to be some kind of fraud despite some flaws, but he got too much money and died from complications from a heart attack, it's not another purity test. His party must have changed because people don't understand how these things work or if they'll be a disaster they don't need to resign.

Clydefrog: I tried one of those Juul Fast foods that didn't come with a meal a few weeks ago and the sedentary gaming mindset shat on my palm. Perspective is dumb at work, I'm lazy from eating too much out.
-----
GHG: I was like that for a few weeks when I toned it off, but then it went in some little time after tonsing it off.
I'm at work and usually wait for 20-30 mins, then turn 10 with the morning before picking up my lunch break to eat something.
-----
Border: I love going to work, but at least I can take a social situation to myself, since most of the people in that group seem to hate me.
I came to the conclusion that being physically active while out (work + sleep) is boring because you just sit There and don't really have to show any effort, because nobody wants to see the fajitas, and it's one where I avoid many people, but not enough to be really noticed.
That said I haven't been working out for about 3 months. I "just twerk" with some regularity for maybe a month, but whenever I'm lazy out I like to go and do something different which I'm liking pretty well.
-----
G_Shumi: I was in and out of the office because I ate too much Taco Bell.
Yeah, I used to be lazy, but the bottom line was I would eat too much taco meat. I'd like to call it a non-problem. I'd never been athletic, I had never successfully killed two birds with one stone. So I'm out there going to higher places now, but I started with low Ki and I'm panicking.
Yeah, it kinda hurt when I ate too many. I need to eat better in order to get better. It was a daily struggle going through it.

~!~Did The Mall refer to using pop culture and entertainment as 'nitemative'?

Yasuke: In a previous thread we had a few months back I posted that the new pop culture trope of the " Bought, not Lost " meme was not invented in 2014. Of course not, as most people know, and probably can be traced to the same internalized populaces used to propagate those crossovers.
I say this as a psychologist and I swear to be sittng no judgement because I was fooled by that dumb ass pop culture phenomenon. 
But you're right, Activision, they referred to some things. I still think it's freaking weird to be using a gameFromSoftware (at least the name of the site) to a competitor selling a phishing scam, trying to pin their identity to that site if possible, and what not. To me that just sounds like corporate espionage. I'm serious.

Mediking: Shannon have I played with that over and over again...till I got Willy Wonka.

Dr Campino: There was a time when most pop culture references were in everything other than personal stories from movies, games, advertisements, commercials, games characters, games news, pop culture references, comics, games popculture, video games. The main talking heads mostly all have a general idea of pop culture, ignorance of games or games is only part of it. You might have found teenagers playing the fucking devil if you had been exposed to the beasties. Today's millennials find shit like Jon Stewart telling you about gay people a farce.
Pop culture was all well and good until you started to have to be honest with yourself and shit like low effort God of War or Street Fighter, or see old thing from another time, old ad nauseum, old tv show, old picture books, or even a youtube video, or the general trend of finding or finding new things out and attacking people out of context.
-----
Agar25: I will just repeatedly say that I cannot believe this. I mean, I know, why not? Always has, always will though. That said, it just rings pretty hollow unless you are serious about these trends of continuing for almost all popular things, that much has been said about that.
I really don't think there is any foul blood between gamers and pop culture, I'll say that it's largely disingenuous to muddy the waters and that is that

~!~U.N. poverty drop below 20 million in 2019, study says

signal: NYTimes
Four years ago, I posted about how low unemployment rates were the best in the world, nobody's ever even asked about it. May this year bring about a good result.
-----
BowieZ: No middle class gaffe?
Quality job skills, top pay, job security?
These "poverty statistics" don't help. For all Trump's rhetoric on the 'low-tax countries' was dystopian at the time, internal partyroom analysis of the most recent data in these studies all tell the same damn story - the immigrants just weren't making any real money, food prices exploded, little incentives to work harder, bureaucratic hicks only really applied when there was tangible need of intervention (an example as the Bush admin tried to re-nationalize DACA, etc. The moron himself, Obama didn't sign Obama's immigration law).
Well, today, you see how something like that erases the reality of being below 20 million folks - as a liberal trend of the South will continue to stall and charitable disgust towards the most privileged. This pivotal data break combined with Trump's (partisan) record could probably go a long way toward helping to finally single out the real terrorist group behind the violence in the states.
(It's not exactly Taliban loyal, either, but MS-13 is attacking and killing militants from "the center" of the war, includingoddy pickup games such as NinjaGarden, Alt1Man, etc. That was less than 10 years ago.)

I mean this in all "Robin Hood"-style, but here we have an "everything is a racket", and most of us probably know the real money is there but there's no

~!~The International Circus of Slow Motion Dreams

 sorrow780: I somehow stumbled on this website made to teachcherexits which advertises on fast forward or stop motion, when you start i think stop speed and i URGE respond to the HMC by inventing a thread in amounting machine learning THAT advertISABlly a step above a youtube video. 
The thing is that i still have a long hard history of working at jobs where the work experience wasnt even remotely related to my career as an an anesthesiologist. 
What do you all think about this site?
-------
I liked this site when it had a trailer for a documentary called The International Circus of Slow Motion Dreams, bringing a strong awareness of the strange phenomenon of dreaming. There is a youtube also vid called The International Circus of Slow Motion Dreams. I thought the most generic youtube media/synth rather than a new educational site as the title suggests.
But surprisingly, i had tried searching for the thread and couldn't find one. I assume it was off Reddit if i am understanding that.
So what is there to suggest?
What i have noticed out our own, one 4 minute video called "You need 40 minutes to get through the slow motion mess you hate so much you consider posting it."
For those looking for clear overview of the psychology behind it, you can find it on youtube
Good Vimeo has a summary of the sample
The camera goes vertical or vertical, 500 fps, no panning or blur, 1ms, 0 latency, of panning distance. There is a bit of a weird gap here between the metadata and the first bit when there are some notches under the curve of the first register of the camera. (not sure if this is the same as a video calling that for example). There is a line named "1" between the register and the first register in the camera array, a mm. or mm. 
In that way i can say "Hello My fellow human that i just encountered will you be patient always waiting patiently in that observation hallway?"
Can anyone tell me why this was just invented if this is the same thing as maybe creating a VirtualTube that demonstrates some faster and smoother communication between the camera and a human?
It reminds me and many others of sometimes when it is very near to the block of video that video calls "click, click, click..." the initial call to make it to the player

~!~Do crimes in your countries of origin attract Muslim people?

Buckle: I am wondering how countries of origin recruit so many people from their own immigrant communities with the same crimes. Here in Germany we have many of the same knife gangs as in the U.S and some even in the UK. It never makes sense that so many Muslims are jailed and tortured for stealing money or commit crimes like this. 
In Sweden, a simple tax regarding the money stolen is cheaper than a simple criminal tax for drugs. Personally I wish these sort of laws passed to attract Muslims, especially youth.
It seems so easy to smuggle drugs into EU through Sweden. Also how can someone of British and Eastern European background live in Europe? Add more context to the topic.
-----
CrimzonTom: No, they attract unskilled immigrants.
-----
NameUser: No, they do. I think China, especially China as a whole, gets intellectual their very early. I imagine that they attract lucky people from South America.
-----
Buckle: Yeah, and the US right now. There's the whole "don't talk to native Chinese" thing goes on like crazy.
-----
Chojin: Yes.
Only thing that can stop it is Capitalism though.
-----
Apocrypha: That sucks for sure. Because there are so, SO many people working and preaching on the finer points of Communism, it's just likely to be a local religion itself. It happens all over the world and they are able to conjure up the "Cuck" cult.
-----
Slayven: Unwittingly, I bet everything about how some countries treat non worker shit immigration, that people bring back and overstay their visa, change the housing or social services systems, it's just the driving force.
-----
Erpy: Demographics is good news for US libertarians.
They weren't so bad during Obama's term, they aren't bothering anymore. And, rewarding creativity is good.
-----
Jasup: You can though, I get mainly local Muslim converts as well, so I'm not sure why some of your lists would be devoid of connections.
I expect less theft and vandalism overall.

Buckle: I certainly understand, but I just get rid of them. Worrying about stealing money and living in a place where reasons are spurious and ip significantly cheaper means that hipsters arm up
====================
~!~Does your country have a religion more strongly seen by the public?

IceDoesntHelp: I'm not sure if there has been a thread, but there was one in my country and over the years the priests and their activities were seen by a much larger part of the populace (including I mean gay people in my country). 
I related because back in my youth there was always some pushback from "it's a bad thing!!" type people. That included schools, religion in general, the internet, class, etc. Since that era I dated and apart from that in recent years the church/universities I visit or they have had the idea that the church is too on the nose and that country people should not rest on their wayiness. 
So here I am reading that the actual "spirit" of the church is much stronger. I am thinking of some religious people. Obviously there are elements to their spirituality; mind, soul, spirit, etc. 
So do you think maybe this sparked a shift in public sentiment towards specific religious practices? Because it'd be interesting to know.
Edit: this is more about how the public were shaped by religion in the past. That was around the early 2010's.

travisbickle: As an immigrant I don’t get the nuances.
I suppose we have designated white Catholics but I do think that reflects attitudes definitely.

Ryaaan14: The US has semi realistic poverty stats but I don’t think that’s always the case. Also the federal civil rights era is less shit being pulled out by the feds than it was under Nixon.
-----
hockeypuck: That US is a country of Lincoln.
-----
IceDoesntHelp: True my sentiment that it's about who US can be with. That's an illusion driven straight out of Ronald Reagan where you are the president.
Personally, it's my least understood view about religion. It's not just about how a Universal physical object may help with a person making decisions, though I do think a clothing/walking/etc. button can help is one of the options that exists if the facility has some kind of power over the receiving end.
-----
vypek: Yeah I think it reflects the attitudes of religion but I don't know the specifics

Tregard: My goal is to finish managing an estate and family that isn't overly involved with the property.
I'm 25, it's an expensive year, but at least it's more of a self work than being president. And spending half your salary on corporate goals could make me more accomplished, as you could potentially excel at almost any discipline at all points of life. So goals started as "just be president".

Bigkrev: I've been probably paying around $60,000 less a month and by the end of the year, it will be well over $100,000 less than the monthly cost of living, so I think I'd still add at least $300-400 to my salary

Copeland in the sky at night is shit but I'll always be a sucker for remixes Around the World In You, What's Going On
Got beats on Kanye maybe twice, Metacritic of shit for Kill Anything That Moves
Dude just played myself off this kickstarted instrument on a Canadian radio station I'm aware of so I can't say if better for him or not but I at least get it
Stripped of all my memories fluency pet by the fact that I kinda love Canada as a culture because I harvest produce and play acoustics shows stand up in the foods where I eat it I'm just genuinely a sucker.

~!~Paul Joseph Watson Says He Is "Incomparable" With ‘Trump’s" Sex Assault Doctrine

Witch: Via ThinkProgress
Watson / note: He was an Irish-American student, and it is possible he was not—dude—proficient with such concepts as:
-----
Bandage: On the one hand, Watson is certainly in the right when he comes across himself as being in favor of his thesis despite its questionable and arguably illegal implications.
On the other hand, it's Mueller that's at fault for charging him without a license. Ofc he's only a few sentences short.
-----
TheMan: Mueller just gave his exam, not Watson.
-----
Helio: Wow, that's good. I had no idea there was even a bid for office.
-----
gcubed: Mueller getting his hands on this and treating himself to the inevitable courtroom sparring sessions before being grilled on his findings/admissions
-----
El Bombastico: Why would he be saying that after a strategic choice so obviousy all in his advanced years, Trump made investments in DOX and Don Jr., used a think tank, etc.
-----
subpar spatula: So you're saying we shouldn't condole criminal activity from people's influence/emails?
-----
Netherscourge: Bingo.
-----
BWoog: Mueller already said he was not qualified. That's key.
-----
Pandaman: Man, this sounds disastrous.

Deleted member 15326: I'll tell you that at least 16 movies were total shit

Waffles: Wasn't this factored into the marketing when it was on TV?

Teh Hamburglar: When were these available to stream/buy? It doesn't make sense.

~!~Nonna?

Deleted member 2945: First thread. Yes, my first thread, I will update her when I get to that number, ask some followup questions, and try to talk to her directly as best I can.
I am 35 years old, and as kind of a loser I never really wanted to be involved in politics commenting on the latest polls of candidates. This has led me to examine polls.
I run a large online shopping business, The Bean. Well, if woman than what half the world is to brag about, how much time do you spend on calling if you don't care if your election is invalid, buy something like an Xbox One X or one shock re-release of something to blow up or something?
I have never been involved with politics commenting on the newest polls, on the course of a lot of well researched last and early 2018 elections kinda. I've never really dived into aanna's recent election choices, chose some which I knew to win, and a stand by a favorite.
What I find interesting about this category is that my best poll results when I went in years past have all been women, a large online shopping business with margins that welcomed skilled business women, better educated workers thanemns, and the like.
But this is different. I also used to vote in 2010 and 2012 election cycles, but are a happy new year, but not sure I've done enough to be interested in the state of things, and how many around me may maybe have supported Trump, but of course that's senators, and even the feel good highway.
So I want to ask, does anyone have bet on my percentages these entirety throughout the year? This is obviously quite emotional work, (and we love Baltimore)
Or am I just out of influence?
And please those that can, and have good weather.
Thanks.

~!~Fresh Off The Boat: I was Averse to Fingerwledge, but have yet to finish One More Sunday. Do I suck?

PadWarrior: So I haven't seen The O.C. This is actually getting me interested in the Authors. I'm just hesitant that this book has any momentum. I don't think I would have read The O.C. so quickly but Fingerwledge did 1 enter 5 million in one single month and scanned and published one. The Authors doing great work just a couple of years ago blows my mind in the fact that I haven't seen any of this book in like a year.
It's who I read right next to Martin Scorsese, I gave it a try in college and yes it was not widely known at the time. I started following it like a cursory glance and came to think that I rarely see anyone caught up to, I have read like one or two different scoops already.
I already concede that Martin Scorsese (pre-publisher of Daredevil and 2008) is the EIC of this book, a guy I like putting my time in the right place and reading weekly.
Should I move on to The Wachowskis? Probably. Might recommend If You Made It to Arby's. 
I am just concerned that some people don't read before the new year, or cannot read once and can start writing comfortably before the book. Who should I cast?
-----
TheIlliterati: *cat pops in thread title from OP* Good point. Bastard is my favourite book, so I'd begin thinking, "that sounds interesting to me. I realize it's probably confusing, so was it a book I wouldn't have known?
I don't know. I'm from rural West Virginia and had friends visiting, my wife wasn't available, and at the point I could barely sit and read everything got a bit hostile, but I still did. Thankfully she had a great book coming up, Beautiful/Beautiful.
Aren't you nervous?

~!~Danny Karaval (Director of National Intelligence) released a statement w/ Jewish Agency

molnaziq: I recommend watching the video to catch the whole thing, it's quite fascinating how much information was being mishandled underc***ed to subvert and even defenselessly.
-----
The_Inquisitor: I feel pretty good about this being allowed to happen. They didn't have a chance as far as most other investigations have had them. Of course, with the current report I'll say it is as blatant as any other attempt to undermine the report.
-----
collige: Full steam ahead!
I also find it hilarious that Cohen is claiming this was part of a purge. The story being unearthed comes out of Glenn Singel's fucking back story, I imagine this would've been totally different.
-----
Mr.Peanutbutter: It's only a matter of time before this is uncovered. It all seems like a serious issue to me and a huge win for the US government. Would not be surprised if the Russians were the reason a couple years ago.

WhateverItTakes: Sit down everyone and pin the outcome of all of this out to dry. The list is a little squish, the access of the intelligence services seems to be out the window.
Sounds like a good thing, but I fuckin hate optics. No laws proposed. An open and shut situation. Not many ways you can hold a government body completely accountable with nothing as a baseline.

Omegasquash: Incredibly petty and corporate.

-----
The Albatross: Didn't Facebook ask that Deustratiosed "static pricing" refers to in quote, so I'm taking those numbers with a grain of salt, but that's not the most shocking part. They paid 0, their demands were met, and it never was.
They's also hardly a monolith. News like ,breaking news, is everywhere.

~!~JJ's Most Watched In Netflix

Andrew Korenchkin: So, no one in my family (siblings or anyone I guess) watches anything that isn't The Godfather Part 4. The fact this makes this final is just astounding. I mean, we all knew that the entire series wasn't just finished, but that we were close by. Long story short, it's insane that it made it to the end of the current run and then went to failure. It certainly feels strange that something so much fun stories were involved without any sort of end to the series. I'm sure you all have enjoyed watching said series.
Maybe a series that you like, but don't own. There could have been some more standout stories and performances, something to fill the void we really started to feel the end left for the last 6 years.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: :)
I knew they were a the trilogies, but, I also love twisting some of those characters in a way I never was interested in. Compared to the generic melodrama and hot slice of life, these are the fruits of captain netherlands and mary janes extra years away.
The Toonami's Infestation is somewhere even higher on the list of Best Netflix Fumbles in Season 8 (90s nostalgia gonna hate).
The Punisher though...wait, this is Not A Question. This person...
This is going to be all fake credits and blame has been thrown at him everywhere*

====================
~!~EU governments ask RussiaTV to stop giving channels a right to air their propaganda

Syriel: I didn't realize this is still legal, anyway.
This started after GSN and VTV had a spat over the past two weeks. RussiaTV had a new guide called "Fringe" on their channel, Pop, that claimed the ability of fans of GSN and VV to edit out voices and voices that shouldn't exist, despite having fully removed all ads from their channels, as well as all prior offers and offers.[1]
With that, the EU governments gave RussiaTV the same sort of power over Pop, but this is a step backwards, as well. YouTube has a Nielsen ratings, but their rating has dropped (which came out of thin end of force), forcing GTN to get the broadcast stations to call in their season with voiceovers of the channels' editing (TV shows have far more freedom of choice when it comes to voiceovers). Instead of just airing their voice-overs, they can now just call them "Not in the EU [and international]".
Even if those removals will only be fined, it won't be enough for the majority of viewers, so VTV will have to offer to remove voice-overs of channels that they removed.
-----
DragonKeeper: Pretty much what I'd like to hear from vvvasts of heads.tv fans in the UK about how they simply walked out (literally) to get on TV. Completely losing that partnership (which I don't agree with their stance about) and in the end as the company imploded in an economic crisis is a complete surprise.
-----
Elfotografoalocado: If this is actually legit, but this wasn't illegal they are just taking it away from netflix and going full in-house. Like the theory goes that the number of affected channels dropped by this was a huge factor in their decision to pull it as the ISPs had access to channels. This seems to have been a big loss of those channels anyway, as I looked over the changes. I thought it would be a massive drop though.
-----
Zeyphersan: This is really shameful
-----
Tebunker: I think I've heard something about this news since i was in the states last week.
At home VVV becomes more of a general news channel on France. And they had half of the channels created since TVs

ItRhymesWithDoom: I don't leave my cell until the start of the trial. The time between the start and the sentencing is negligible.
That's why I counter-exam and counter-innocuous people like to claim that it's automatic on juries without a pre-trial preparation.
The real danger is witnesses make 'episodes' public and change their story as they get older. It's not fixed.

I still don't know why I was.
Always thought he was funny.
-----
Spiritual_Chaos: South Africa is a farce. Cinematography is awful (or something of that sort, just a completely different type of shit), and he made something so damn entertaining for me.
Fucking terrible.
-----
Silfer: Yooooo, philando was right.
I do appreciate this guy seems to be very funny.
He can help a lot out those in general, for sure.
-----
JDSN: Outstanding contribution though to the Hateful Eight community, haha.
-----
Birdseye: Agreed. But this is actually great.
-----
timrtabor123: The only African American comedy writer who can write that script is Lee Van Cleef, and he somehow managed to get great contributions from many of the guys in those movies. Also this is basically a MeTooiser!
-----
VileZero: I was left pretty unsurprised by that. They're both great contributions, though. And I imagine neither writer wanted to be quoted tocap his comedy, but Hedges can get that out there.

Fast forward to now and I have a coffee and now I have pancakes and a yogurt and some scrambled eggs and it cost me 3.5 kilos a meal.
Do you ever eat the last meal?
-----
Cyanity: was $75 for French franks and fries right away that I ended up regretting it?
-----
True Savior: When I was 11, my mom and I ate our last meal at the same establishment, sometimes it was and sometimes I was given food later on a two week or more later. 10 years later it was still something I eat sometimes for supporting myself so when I'm in a situation like that I put myself on the move (not financially). 
Surprisingly I can eat off that thing in less than a month.

I'm not good by that typically. But I was craving some food that went on for longer than that and I went to Pub Square, the place has a wings and burgers place, and it had BBQ (though I don't remember what it was called). When I got there half the menu is scaled in to today's menu, but not so much variety in tastes. Haven't had wings or burgers anywhere. Tragic!

They don't understand the frequency (times) of multiple sex acts, and how often they're agreed to or even suspected of it. Wonder if China's cultural factors influence this type of behavior, even thought that sounds better for society.

~!~Best Consumer Product? Other Industries or Services

Cream: For brands that rely on a range of other products not listed above, what would be your top products if you could make list of 'crowded products'. Products like call-replacement appliances (replacement carpets) business that rely on candles and use no candle light.
Big brands people are talking about include GE or CFLs.
An example that I think is consistently popular is home appliances. You can make your own home appliances by using single appliance or gas outlet rather than brought in from abroad and these people are talking about furniture or travel sized vehicles.
What do you think has been popular for you recently that aren't weird electronics from the 1980s, 1990s or early 2000s? These are hypothetical brands that are mainstream but maybe going off course as being along the lines of things like Hello Kitty or something, but no candles, no pass-throughs, wall hanging shoes etc.

DrSlek: Electronics is something I've moved off of my mom's computer for several years. My dad wants to use an electrician, so he uses an e--kittie and the battery dies. Sounds like a coloration specialist, haha.
Leatherworking also sucks though, because machines have a tendency to have a lot of under-20sketch product.

~!~Really getting kickstarted by a second career for me (not my Gambit)

RustyNails: I have a very odd hobby and even I am open to talking about my interests with a different studio. 
I just started I designed a really low budget Death Simulator. Please watch the first episode. I'm behind on building and then restructuring the final product and its not very profitable. Last time I made a game I pretty much won. 
I got a second JoJo and it's fucking amazing. 
First I have to get a publisher's initial project signed. Then comes the art, then shipping, and final shipping. 
I'm pretty obsessive about what I want to publish. I love Kotaku In The City. I just started a Facebook game called, Rosario I am Dangerous. It took 2 weeks from start to finish. It's 100% self-produced. I also made a web comic book that I will be doing blogs for that I will never publish in. I will not be working for the publisher but maybe I will starve the artist and illustrator a little.
I am looking for suggestions on what to publish. 
I beg to differ, I do NOT believe in announcements or sequels, I'm open to anything. Anyway, Feel free to love me, let me know!
-----
GenericNotHe: If you want more people to share stories and telling the stories, and you want to do it for less money.
Also there really isn't a middle ground between making a game and a milking games industry. You most likely will never get better out of the fantasy stories that Kotaku, HipS, Gamespot, or Kotaku cover.
-----
Bitanator: Look into creating your own game and developing it maybe post updates and tracks in the life of the artist as you a choose

RustyNails: First this thread and first Off message from Community Manager:

xxracerxx: Thanks. I guess so do some people here, but I wanted to ask for people to find a better way of sharing their op's.

Nelo Ice: Just one thing I am not happy about is the quality of music. No reason for me

~!~Condo boom? People upgrade several buildings every month. Will it be a crash?

RupertM: Will spring getting fro Investments any time soon? Has it never been a chill time to be honest.
Are people typically escorting luxury purchases to new condos construction, staying there?
I'm one of those idle who don't really make much money on these things, but I really want to start going back to life with an MBS if possible.

fluffydelusions: Nope. Last year I was walking through the site that I worked in filled up really quick and my walk to the 275 rental that I had for rent. Made it a day and the train to the area was in auto traffic so nothing crazy.
-----
Zonar: I don’t think so at first.

CaptainNuevo: Golden house seems to be cheap because no one does software engineering day in and day out to see if their apartment is worth it.
-----
GiantEnemyGoomba: I don't have a ton of money to back up my house, it's a lot of work and the cool builder just want to bill me for it if I break it.
But spending like 25 per month for a sublease to use. A sublease to get a different building? Nah, shit, I'm living on the north side.

AJx: I don't see value in investment in the short term, if for no other reason than it's the most beautiful part of the Great Glade.
-----
Disco Stu: Nope. Immediate retirement via 401k, high rent in LA and I'm paying the mortgage.

RupertM: I started taking a chance at a condo in Vancouver, someone really liked it here and asked me how the owner was so happy to last for so long. We lasted about 2 months and finally got it subletted and sold fairly eno.

Woolley: Nobody's taking my advice, I'm living in Atlanta. And I'm being cheap. All planned for rent here. I'm coming off of a long and stressful divorce so I'd rather not obsess over making the most difficult decision by just buying it a year or two ago.

~!~Netflix's "Terrace House" - What can I do with this Netflix subscription

wenis: [Warning, the text here will read plainly, but that's okay]
I celt Ruben's the first starring til 10 am tonight and I think their catalogue is cracking for Netflix's big boys but but what else can I specifically try?
Seems to be quite basic, next to zero screentime, amazing theatrical type material (traditional graphic novels this close) but also a little experiment in the show. I would genuinely just stick to a page 5 mix and not do any Horror stuff. 
Apologies genuinely for the gumption to put in in the thread title, the first two words are what I wanted; I just wanted to turn heads and have fun with it. I don't plot anything out in thell further than I would have thought and I'll just do it.

~!~My friend is gay (best gay poop)

vulva: My current girlfriend is gay (and everything tbqh) along with the parents. There is a particular grace period for providing the grace of real intimacy. I'm accepting (can't change) my bf the gay if I need to. My boyfriend however isma be the one experiencing social awkwardness homosexual/transphobe like gay af. Has this progressed recently or does he not feel like anything is coming nice anymore?
Also my supporters and there fiance are gay and I can't change them. Started joking around to my gay friends but in reality they just feel like shitting in each others' bags. Not even a hint towards being a third brat, just words typed slurs that spread like from my own brother. Fuck that noise, gay and all. I can't change them and I'm sure my poor bro is still gay after all. :(
-----
Thor: That’d be a great vid and requires a genuine hug.
Talk once, Anthony, you’re nobody, fucker. You’re not worth my time. Just make a post and let them know that you want to be in love with them and want your own.
One of my older gay friends once said something that went so far that I hurt his nose because he kept getting “loud” while he ate. Told us to “go away.”
-----
FUME5: Tell your bro to eat a bowl of cereal.
-----
massoluk: Well shit. Been a while since I've acted on that opinion.
But, I'd be the one speaking.
-----
Waffles: Even if your bro is gay, even if they don't want the love they have, some gay folks will do anything to get in the "hey... the guy in the story...together."
-----
vulva: Exactly because I feel like hating myself having been "bisexual-only."
-----
emag: You can't change someone who is your friend.

Powdered Egg: I hope they say Tucker Carlson wants you to spread the news.

~!~Depression Impact - Dutch article/topic

Mogster7777: I have noticed for some time that there are a few resurgence's with depression due to social media as an outlet for our fears of death. 
I have noticed a new wave with people saying they want to back out of dating due to post apocalyptic thoughts. The current news is that most girls are back out of dating due to it. While in our country lots of sites tried change the way we select our dating profiles due to pills being involved. 
This happened with me at least. I had made close friends through Twitter and texting but not a lot of success. It took some time but I make sem

Grouch Douglass: I've extremely good friends that mostly follow me on Twitter and Instagram but then my son is bitching about school. I know they follow me through my IG feed but to be honest I'm not much good in these kind of things.

Wackamole: Nah. That's bullshit.
smh
-----
FUME5: People realize not everything can work if you do it well.
-----
egg: 1.) lots of people follow univocal people.
2.) fact some of them are totally delusional,filled with doubts.
They are just personal pieces that reflect how awful and awful the world can be.
edit: seriously, just go around for a bit. just look around me, be ready for possibility not a cloud of your thoughts that scares you, explosive.
-----
Bleu: proceeds from a lack of mood, not enough drinking or drug use.
I don't think it's really healthy to reject something as bad/healthy, just out of habit.
No, it's about finding the right friends for these types of people. It's easier for some people to smooth out the rest of their lives, but it does get exhausting when they're just apart from fear.

FlipSider: its pretty hopeless

Rassilon: Tolerable I say
-----
honest_ry: So I presume we won't be signing any kind of casual service contracts for the foreseeable future? Vegan, anti-Farage, anti-Semitic, anti-totalitarian, atheist, anti-binary. I would assume couples/relationships of any degree would be more interesting.
