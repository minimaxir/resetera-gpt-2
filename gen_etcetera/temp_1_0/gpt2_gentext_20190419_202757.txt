~!~Japan is in the midst of a rough stretch of animation censorship

AuthenticM: From The Guardian:
From the Independent: 
A little investigative journalism from the Guardian:
I guess this is a good time to share my thoughts:
-----
speedwagen: You should have posted in the anime twitter thread about South Korea's student government for allowing Nyango Kasabi to speak at the right-wing political debate in their high school.
-----
Sou Da: Well, the existential crisis of neocolonialism in China happened before they decided to keep censorship going.
-----
Dekuman: Have we learned anything new?
One of the many hits at Uni was a policy at anime con 2010 in Japan.
-----
Noroi_Kisaragi: compared to top kei-luffy's recent bans on Japan crying in tweets, you can see that you can be 99% of critical communication from the government. i just wish they just stopped.
-----
Birdseye: .
-----

Gentlemen: Remember that you're evil during College, you're always punished like recall at the japan fields and in the national usa esports tourneys.

Kokonoe: very recent.

Shodan14: Menang returned, so who really controls anime now?

~!~NYC Mayor bans soda vending machine vending machine

fluffydelusions: 
-----
Transistor: Good, I had legitimately never even thought of vending machines. I mean I'd survive but I'd get bored and not want to change my mind.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Who cleans them?
-----

Charizard: I'm 100% in favor of what NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio is banning.
-----
VectorPrime: I’m still waiting for the time when vending machines are less intrusive than ever before. Again.
-----
entremet: As in, more jobs to be created for workers, yet less jobs are created, since more jobs will be acclimated to the change.
As long as people stay employed.
-----
Casual: You only see businesses move to the streets when the city is full.
-----
CarpeDeezNutz: No, i can't see them moving because of how distracting they are.
-----
XMonkey: That’s something that I’ve noticed, can’t shake that. When I walk through a store with a soda I don’t slow down and stare longingly at the guy behind a soda machine that’s lined up or whatever, I can’t help but feel unnerved. I can’t see their intentions, I can’t sense the chaos, I’m just taking it day at time.

~!~Saudi Arabia - Nobel Peace Prize

Candescence: Smaller version (search, title etc)
ORIGINAL POST
We are well halfway through 2018 and in a very positive way. As I said in the past we are entering a period of peace in the region, with al-Numan having become a symbol of the peace and stability in the whole region. This naturally brings the need to improve relations for a fair split in the Muslim-led nation, as in Iran and Turkey (by about 50% ish, the multi-hundredth spread in our data!). Now's good to challenge those responsible for this peace, especially in issues concerning the establishment of the Ministry of the Interior. In order to counter those reasons, at least in the end we can expect the rest of the Muslim world to first commit mass violations against some of the targets in the past, so everything can begin successfully.
Perhaps the most compelling argument for peace here in Europe was Stephen Elser's excellent BBC radio program, The Face Off with Arthur Sulzberger (Actually, Sulzberger is the guy from The Invisible War). Yeesh, what a relief to restart the next phase of the journey to fix this terrible country's horrendous human rights record.
One thing I didn't realize, however, is that the Willard effect, which has existed since the 10th time, is now happening again. At the limit of human rights, 0.0% of the 1% have have committed that evil each year.
At the same time, HSN recognized this trend, its member state, is currently putting right now 20 BILLIONS Yemenis in danger, starving, with thousands more making their way to Europe.
Since 2015, we have asked every year on the UN to strengthen the efforts against terrorism by not just the Saudis and their puppets in the Gulf States, but also Western Nations to counter their Russian Stream sales of military technology to Yemenis to fight the Houthis. In my case, it was USAID. Even with mighty corps like the EOD and Solid Ground Office, I expect many dozens of them with even less enthusiasm and then Zakhar.
Since 2015, several countries have knocked down, with the goal of supporting, improving the internationally deserved peace. Since 2015, we have told many of the biggest gas companies, and learnt something on the issue of the unions that they are running out of gas.
The desire for peace also travels into other

NoName999: You lookin' like a middle age coupe.
Okay! Revival!

Schreckstoff: No real evidence but a Trump compatible video thinks Krumlovitch, business suits and Bulgogi are from the Balkans. *insert crappy first post lol*
-----
Kraken3dfx: The Rogan v Limbaugh video is good; always good to reference other stuff.
-----
BFIB: Jesus.
-----
Whatesby: This has to be tons of money, right?
-----
Sign My Guestbook!: Good lord.
Just like Trump's original pardon and indictments.

Nerfgun: jesus this is so fucking stupid
the spread of these videos is concealed from the Russian's too

ody: U wot?

Admiral Woofington: Holy fucking shit. Read the text...

Kthulhu: Fair play, they didn't want the courts to take their path to do that.
They didn't even need to create the videos, there's tons of them on YouTube.
They've just gotten allowed to fuckin' make this shit up.

Septy: john carpenter.img/migrates/commonplace/confessed
these types of people deserve to be charged for corruption with no jail time or potentially more in jail time. so sick

Sweeney Swift: Something tells me this guy just snapped out of Fantastic Beasts 2

Joeku: I thought maybe he retired to Guyver, then later found out he would never come back from Canada ever again. Ambition, yo!
Who's sick of this fuck up shit?

TheUnseenTheUnheard: Yup. It's a public servant, not an American official.

AyaisMUsikWhore: We could be seeing another Tom Cruise case with people walking around with kevlops on their faces like they're going to a boxing match and eventually getting mortally sick

~!~EU pushes for ASIO as it looks to cut channels to Brazil, threatens move to full rights charter (._. )

famikon: Source: 
As of right now, the 3 Brazilian channels controlled by Netflix and other players (which are basically Netflix like ones) aren't shown in the US and yet Netflix isn't showing it in other countries. I guess they want to access those channels on their Brazilian network. 
Changing my family's TV rights is kinda annoying, though, so any stateside content producers can see that I'm not part of their family's family's charter (which they can decide kind of). Anyone else here knows of a good solution?
-----
behOemoth: if people dont want their kids watching their X-rated version, i'll be vetoing the channel anyway.
-----
famikon: This is a bad move by EU. A plan for the EU is meant for individual countries. It's not alright to fund a fucking convention if your country doesn't want the same rights (and interfaces can be patchy).
+ Also was a protest vote as well. Why would the EU ask all member states to respect that charter?
-----
behOemoth: In Brazil they are asking for legislation too.
-----
Katyros: To all those folks we upgraded our ISP rights recently :(
-----
EraldoCoil: Nothing surprises me anymore. No real reason why they would change it. Brazil is much cheaper and Brazil was one of the good players in the world. Good thing is that we will get the the rights to all those channels too. Fast Internet is pretty much impossible to change in Brazil, right?
Unless Netflix that distribution was ripped off and rebranded to an "ESPN/PLN" channel?
-----
behOemoth: Also we there's tons of "super suckers" going on to promote themselves (Netflix, Amazon and so on) so shit sucks.
-----
KingSnake: This is so stupid. They can just choose any country and opt out with no restriction and I'm all livid.
-----
Birdseye: The ChannelZero YouTube channel no longer exists?

~!~Sen. Sheyra R. Booker expected to be the Democrats President in 2020

CrazyIvan: We literally had a thread about this today but MSNBC suddenly made it a feature. Now when Kamala Harris is going to be President in 2020 the race is now open anyway as the race is "locked."
-----
Brock Reiher: They literally invited Cory to the primaries.
-----
Spaced Harrier: That'd be interesting.
The fever dream of Latina voters doesnt end.
Womp womp
-----
Kirbivore: Most of the female political candidates in the US is what they were hoping for.
I'm also very glad I can't name a female future president right now. But only time will tell so.
-----
Jessie: If it’s all monitored and controlled it needs to be very clear that Booker is good at running a progressive campaign. Otherwise he could kneecap the nomination on that trip to the fuckin nomination.
-----
borghe: when is the time for those people that are so fucking tired of #womanfortherim/#firstnameall?
edit: well as an aside, it seems like we have a pattern. has happened numerous times. "first" candidates are more likely to win in the primary with donors backing them. who else is running in the primary, often first times the general public vote and usually going in with the full support of the party. not saying that's the only reason but I think having people vote with that in mind makes it easier to talk it out. This is something that got better recently w/ young people having more political voices come out.
-----
Savitar: Shame not.
-----
bangai-o: As a generation after generation we go to court to stop/force people to vote, we need to see the full effects of this on society. 
(This is why I am not a Trump supporter but the movement to distance ourselves from women still has a ways to go)
-----
KtotheRoc: I had no idea about this. I wish Elizabeth Warren would run as a "nominee" candidate, where she would start with winning the primaries.
-----
Nikus: It was insane when I was young and a member of the democratic coalition but during my time with Trump it became clear that there wasn't anything progressive about the guy.

~!~Did I get my corn corn correctly?

God_Of_Phwoar: What I'm reading is that in cookies, corn is rising. It's being used in cookie containers as "cotton candy", as opposed to corn chips. Where is that? I'm thinking it'd be biscuits.
It's not even being usedpen in biscuits.
What the fuck, corn? Food can be wet, rye bread dry, etc. What else is there to add?
-----
Dahellisdat: In Turkey it's called Turkey Dump. In Kellogg's a "dixie cup" that is blamed on the food.
-----
Neece: You need an ALDI to tell Alaskan corn to dump.
-----
Surface of Me: Lately this shit has been in the news for Texas boys. I'm starting to think it's about Texas corn. Pretty damn dumb.
-----
menacer: It can actually be applied to corn. Some farmer says high the yields, stop it to ask corn farmers about its color and actually use it. Some say refurbed to not use something that is even exceeding 5% but then corn yields to their yield limits. So it's not eternal corn or cornmints.
-----
Schreckweg 5000: They look like cigarettes. Never mind this, correct.
-----
Hero_of_the_Day: No seriously, holy shit corn chips are a thing. Dixie cups are bad enough but nothing meaningful in there they just look like spiraling sugar.
-----
Tinos: Dear god, semi sweet corn chips. Forget this shit. These produce some of my favorite snack foods. You should try take out those immediately lol
-----
God_Of_Phwoar: There's data show dogs fed this make their corn mince we're unscathed.

-----
HStallion: Watched it last night. Always pictured it too melodramatic yet I hardly caught a shot yet of the cast. Jamie Foxx was the only one I've seen that does James' side of his life and he didn't even tell me how he got invited to the party or what horseshit point he was on either.

~!~Give Kniven - *Reprise* Thriller Dog Memorabilia (Homecoming movie, Deadpool "Lite" etc). Not the most popular release but the best.

Slayven: You say that Badbitch Me didn't get thunderstorms from the theaters?
So 50 years ago, theds were the worst thing for comic book fans of era. Yet scenes were everywhere, creators were hosting the repurposed movies, TV shows were on YouTube, became a part of DC comic book airing on BSG. Now, Kniven clearly has the stuff defined in the article so highly.
Problem is you see some terrible cover designs taking up time. Instead of current terrible stuff, they have WAY too iconic release material to justify dysploring shipping. They are just bad aesthetics. 
Problem is now they are the only copies of Kniven's art he is allowed to do now (as far as I know).
-----
VectorPrime: I get who this is, but for a Criterion release the quality probably won’t be replicated and/or your Blu-rays won’t even see the light of day. 
It might happen to Represenuu in the future.

~!~Spielberg co-founders total rift in iPhone boss list and won't go on board

Vyer: more
Sweeney Swift's + HP = Netflix. Disney + Amazon. It's nice that the boss list just called Tom Cruise.
-----
TheAbsolution: When this news were about to come to light articles about the current turn of the industry or at least when conservatives would know what they were doing it was always going to be a hard list to choose and this definitely could upend that narrative but this article honestly isn't just par for the course.
-----
WaffleTaco: It felt strange when the article came out that this was happening. Even had this to remain concealed. Tom Cruise himself was talking about it.
-----
CloseTalker: Companies fighting to get their stores open on FB is disturbing, regardless, but Tavis (ex-Disney) was banging the “right” drummer after the sorts of stubborn “forced otherwise” stances. Rupert Grint made a humble remark about nuclear war one day, and I know that he has to be one of the most fucking ignorant assholes ever in the world when it comes off like it's an honest discussion about political hate or something.
-----
B'z-chan: I can believe that the Chief Executive has taken the good step of not paying directors what they’re making. I kind of hope Dolores Smith is not going to be called out anytime soon though for giving crap like that little video a click. Even if she is. 
I’d rather the Disney-era HQ has more thrills and more optimism.

Outtrigger888: More photo ops and higher wages for the workers... True made me laugh.

Uzumaki Goku: I just rewatched The Last Jedi for the third time today and I thought for all intents and purposes I was explaining E.T. to the masses, and apparently E.T. Team entered the black hole, ready to crossover the Alliance of Defenseless Walls and TIE Fighters with the Resistance. The resistance made their move to destroy the whole city, but E.T. let out a self-effelling Orbital bust sound before detonating their weapons.
Why does this make Noapathene look like a defeated man?

They came for the Laske with the Resistance in mind and attacked them with brehs.

Xbox Live Mike: Why did they attack Yelawitch meeting both Aesir and Nero on sight to start a war?

The attacking on the place was so fucking ridiculous it made no sense. Did it need to explode? What is the point to destroy the place? The people there were very Brave.
-----
MadLaughter: I don’t know if people denied the Earth two days notice to attack somewhere.

They were tired of quickly conquering and then intimidating and deifying humanity.

One armed guard broke up a sit-in in Caracas today, protesting against Trump's tariffs. Protesters are planning to attack U.S. Consulate in Caracas.
edit: to those outside the US: the optics of this happening are utterly abhorrent. I imagine it would affect various nations but it would probably be fruitful ground for the resistance in Caracas. There has been a large escalation lately.

Pop-O-Matic: It's only known that the guard in that photo broke the law because He's a narc.
-----
Kirblar: There's no way to know that people who reportedly can't find the link between Trump and USA's "anti-Koch" president are bugs? i.e., they're either too incompetent or too much money incompetent for any meaningful involvement. The difference is in how competent they are. But the better "intelligence" sources i.e., Trump's advisors, are of greater help here as are actual politicians and actual aid to the people in D.C.

Either way, 20 years ago I could've made the entire movie look like a movie. Instead...

~!~Trump Ad Ed in the mail, NO MIND CER.

SlickShoesRUCRazy: So its reported on leftist site as expected. They posted it on twitter, blame the right for this “disruption”. The left knowingly allowed a megachurch to become a dictator on their platform.
On Vimeo you have another piece of disinformation. This is a pro-state media campaign. It uses fanboys and Elon Musk, Rachel Goswold (founder of Jacobin), Geraldo, Lorearios y de Jesus, Gloria, Nigel and a whole host of articles presented together well. Rachel and Lorearios have the name Andrew Jackson and how they are a member of the "un shared acrylic figurado cult". Over 50,000 finger puppets, arms, and everything else are possible for said puppet pieces. They also used the nation of Jacob in the design... And here is an example of the type of fanboy-esque piece they used:
This is a perfectly acceptable and well made example of blame being put on the left because humanity as a species is irreversing for a state sanctioned form of horrifying fascist control. What the Right did this after the Civil War and after the insane shit the New Deal brought with the Laws to help normalize extreme white nationalism is fucking unacceptable.

Quite the article. Well worth a read, I had expected reasonable arguments.

-----
RiOrius: A typical Floridian - but good for them for opposing them.

Timeaisis: Considering how racist this is in the general pop-culture sense, one has to wonder whether the Religious Right make the regime change they deserve for putting religion above state rights.

Fliesen: seems very threatening to the church, maybe one would speak out against it's racist practices?
Would it even matter too? Cultural branding, for something as sacrosanct as speech, still fits, right?
-----
ScandiNavy: So they'll just plaster the same ugly alt-right trolls on different sides of the same issues using different facsimiles at the same time? I am a bit bitter about this.
Also, if EDL wanted to take on any fascist, they would need to also shit on racists. The abuses of these alt-right trolls are fairly tame compared to other far right movements.

Surface of Me: There will probably be another vacation situation but I feel really bad for the elderly at work or my old employer.
For anyone who has attended this year I honestly don't know what they're going to look like at any work gigs that go unfinished with nothing really in store for like 8 hours. I've got a family and big flat fee so I'd rather not get time off on vacation like my younger siblings. However, I do have the ability to work if it gets to a wider variety of jobs lol
-----
#1 defender: Do note that AirPort did this in 2017 - a lot of people want to pay more for airpods, but you'll still be dealing with baggage handlers and all that stuff on UPS/DHL-US bags.
If the question is yes, does AirPods count as standard cable/sensory interference when underwater?

Where I live we have a ton of people vacation planning in the winter but you know, apart from airbag use would be really immovable for living a different way.

BLEEN: UWateran is one of those guys that said something cool like "to say the least amount pain and discomfort possible". Fucking traktor should get your x-rays basically. Those things come out looking rad as hell. Add stuff like 'non-permeable splints when hovering over a surface of water' overdo a full on tilt for years.
The only reason I want something fan to be fan instead of standing, is so I wouldn't have to dig my eyes out trying to go swimming and take the AC during games lol.

Surface of Me: My office is fairly insulated from noise so an AirPods (when I'm not working anywhere else) would be nice to have. 
Quick question: I live near a ski resort but that entire area will look like the space tourists blast from remarried to start drilling for oil on.

~!~After 4-6 years of doctors refusing to operate on me, my mom was prescribed Plan B. Do I need it?

Vex: After having a 1-3 year stretch of horrible side effects, I finally had a doctors' note that my symptoms had completely subsumed all of my other side effects. Yes, I had depression, yes, I had Anxiety Concern, but these all subsided within a week.
Eight months later, after a second negative result, my mom has tons of improvement and my life is actually on the same ball and chain, foot, and back foot plane of a foot, all improved for the most part. This is physical therapy at the end of the day, which sounds weird to me, but I've noticed a drastic turn away with my exams and doctor note requests. I'm being dealt with an asshat doctor, but my problem is that when I make people seem to be needing what I describe, I'm being used by them. As soon as I let the ringer of the exam, I walk away without explanation. 
People go from failures to failures, from just having issues, to not having issues to just not having issues. They the same way the chi makes you feel like you need to be "mindful" to be "good." It's called self pity. 
I ask my fellow doctor, who periodically tours me about my issues, if he can help me. It's very telling stuff to see him, though. 
Man, I wish I could walk around my house in my leotard all day without having to ask others to take it, live in my own garden, and don't have to chase me to a doctor's office. Just about to start work, a guy unexpectedly comes to see me and I'm like 'Actually I guess I can't see him now'.
The feeling that I am crouching down and heading straight back to the kitchen, the paranoia of fear that watching out my window is doing my little tyrannical wonders, the feeling of not knowing if I'm about to crazy his arse for suicide, and the feeling of trying to murder someone I never really understood (and still don't know) is causing my mental health to deteriorate so far back, and I've had RSI's for Brodie. My reaction to them is basically

~!~The market for good Asian food is perplexing -- Complete list

massoluk: I mean, this dumb no one ever says Asian food is gross:
But why is there a trend of high-end Asian food in 2018?
Why is there a trend of high-end Asian food in pricing different?
Why is there a trend of high-end Asian food in pricing different?
These dishes are super fresh when you have gotten it in the box, can be made in a relatively cheap area (say, ~20 USD for example), can still be readily available a decade or more later, etc. It's baffling
-----
Trojita: There are literally no Sprouts in Asia unless you want to take the easy way as it would harm the farmer and fork over massive amounts of money straight from the street.

astro: They're doing the semantics right up here, I guess. If you go to go to Seoul Food Market on the east side of Seoul, you'll get bent out of bed by korean beef and ask you to show you something off. When you come back home, you'll be bombarded with spicy Ramen.
Looks like they got that right. It's the world's most popular street food and you're going to eat it constantly. This is why I always get Asian food on pickup.
-----
Lonely1: There's more good Asian food than there is bad Asian food.
By all indicators, East and Seoul Food Market are hugely successful, but I can't find any evidence of their anything ever being as great as in-app purchases can be.
-----
Oheao: If you go to the Korean food market, look at all those things I've said above and you'll understand why they exist as they are. If you go to the West Indian market for food, you will learn a few things about food, culture and history.

PeakPointMatrix: Why the fuck do they give you non curated recommendations when you just simply sign in with just one site? You literally click the damn name, don't you think? Just stare at there screen, even get close enough to see the results and then you can confirm. I personally remain of the opinion that I watch/give great attention to my own fucking TV, and I won't complain about it because it's built to do absolutely nothing.

Skip forward to present day, present day past (present day x3 - x2; x3 - x1)

Fulminator: Terrible bad computer gag ( Bryan Tracy ), bad costumes ( Grand Ryan ), bad main character ( Topanga ), bad moral compass ( Bruce Jonton like tbh ), bad glimpses ( jonton has excellent tv acting but just a bad art )
Going back and watching recent Lost episodes ( Ang Lee , Ubhaserjin , all terrible )
 Mixed twitter reactions, going to bed and dreaming of watching Dumpster Bake videos
Good Job. I really like posts like this

The Albatross: Filthycats and Todd Temperature Works, but good job people! Stoked for Smash!
Jay and Silent Bob's (primary) finale is just a comedy, by the way. That's sad for those two eras,
Jay & Silent Bobs is arguably more enjoyable than Ping pong, it's not Super; Ping Pong is a violent twisted joke between ping pong and hockey (the hilarious platinum skyscraper Dragon)
Bonus points and for dragging out discussion over Columbia Pictures and its art if people want to view it as a single movie. I saw a screening recently with thirty people and it was full of "This is pretty dodgy" attitude and so on.

~!~Females and the best anime ever are one and the same

SolVanderlyn: If you don't know the term, it's the term kids refers to when the opposite gender (or even a person in general) is the center of attention. No guys, Yaoi girls, let’s talk about 8 year old girls.
No context, or unrealistic expectations. No judgement. Just good.
Females: This is me, my imagination is just a mirage. Are you from a region with lots of rare anime?
Edit: I’m younger than 11, I think because I just beat someone in a flash game last month.
And then we have Fems for someone else. Where does magical girl run go?
-Or, more accurately older females and younger men.
- or 
Sometimes you just want to feel 1. These are my guesses.

The objects of the operation were male, mid-20s, Me Nation’s former Special Advisor Bertrand Bone, Jr. of Tax Manipulation, Tobacco, Corruption and Human trafficking.

I want to lock myself in my old position because outside of summer camp for the public, I could use something when I get opportunity to recover.

Whatever life is like, do what you want.
If life isn't good, don't do what you want.
What's nice is if you can take care of yourself, the people around you that are perpetuating the cycle of dependency.

Do what you want and whoever shares your viewpoint.
If life is a journey you want to make and you just don't have something to fall back on, it's absolutely worth it.

~!~Reg E. Cathy and the FOSTA: A Life-But-Ending Video

inner-G: Mad.
The tsunami is out of Capone’s control, and is a tsunami like no other. Beautiful stuff-remiemagining a doomed treasure hunting series. The eerie imagery and eerily comforting narration is far more unsettling than anything depicted in Ava. All the host's hardest work has paid off; the eerily lean and gripping yet sombre scene is just like one of the Milo Yiannopoulos boppin’ 'movies' guaranteed. Plus, E.R. is a amazing villain working on his incredible swordplay, even if he’s got a surface Assault Knife as well.

Sometimes I get confused. The whole electromagnetic spectrum is just spectrum that is attained by computers, TV, Movies, and some electrical work equipment. For example, "your own one", "thee thermostat, calle". Or sometimes I forget that stuff is even possible. Or that things work? I don't know. Either way, just admit you've had an issue but seems like it's there if known and resolved.

Either, is really just about as if they were quietly transitioning away from IE in favor of a web-based approach.

What's that web page that is there solely for you in its current state?

Unless the devs literally just copied most of the functionality from HTML (like they do, without any 'origin' flag) or built in a third party extension, it's quite probably out of date.

Konoe no Katakurenkeyon
This fine old intro is ‘Mountains’ and Tramples is the new (very hard to find) gem - the amazing MOTU (video) for like three hours. 
At this point I’m assuming this is CC Black having started project 4 years ago btw. Thoughts? I’ll probably use this to change my thinking on whether I would say a show-going format or something more akin to a time-limit stair-riding or whether the right thing has to be held up for some cover?

MaximumSpider: I’m turning into three freaking spiders for OP but also iZombie for some reason lol

CosmicGP: The one guy makes the best almost everywhere. I also enjoy Utena Ode to Ode to Senhonari. The series needs more good stuff to fill up all the gap, because then another world might be built.

TheBeardedOne: What I do like best:
What I have is a series I watch since like second time, and I like plot and characters.

XolSec: Utena, I fall in love with Kirishima's original run, with Sasuke finish off a lot of filler.
-----
Frecklestein: Hm. Interesting series, although this one seems better than the original. Its a good series (It's actually more comedy after watching it). I like going to a lot of non-top 25 anime of the time rather than watching.
The music is also better.

torre_avenue: I could eat a bowl of this.
Agreed 100%. Plot wise, the Third Hokage doing the most absurd things seems boring, the metalfoes did the mucking, but I love grounded characters in general.

MouldyK: Jennifer Bendis' costumes???
-----
Deepwater: If Tom Holland's old enough to declare himself as Spider-Man and get a new costume from Tony, tha....
Some Star Lord?
EDIT: Obviously the justice system will show up someday, even if GOT is easily my favorite live action movie with a solid cast so far.
-----
Helec: Civil War 2nd p
-----
Anung: Suicide Squad season 3 
Honestly I'm not seeing too much of this considering they're releasing it's schedule.
-----
ISOM: I think it would look better if they all went over the mother! part where she dies.
-----
Godfather: I both like that, but Thor Ragnarok could be amazing.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Not for me, it looks like early 00s time to me. So I wonder when we'll see their costumes in the live action stuff, like they've covered the whole Old Avengers Canning.
Man I am and hate nerf me. Hope they take proper care to not let rises and stops get spotted everywhere
-----
Effect: Hans Zimmer's Spider-Man suit for Infinity War is going to look raw and crisp. The design is pretty nightmare after awhile.
-----
Lephotographeur: I approve of his design.(Feels like this guy is legit, just for the humor and also the look of the costume seems convincing).

~!~FIBO - Oscars 2019

Mantrox: UPDATE: Tickets have sold out online.
Edit:
Forgive the typo, but this was originally posted 10 hours ago.
The show is incredible. I love me some Bari Weiss. So glad to see this again. 
Will get my tickets printed up tomorrow. Thanks OP.

Deleted member 44288: Be bold. this is the best show they’ve ever made.

KSweeley: At left, Right, and Left... (aka Wednesday at the movies)
Because I can't make racism disappear, I'm being excited about this news. It also means A Star is a Motion Picture is getting the Criterion Collection. The Vintage Collection is a must visit; Accoun, 1998, releases 120 discs of film 240 minutes in the 80's. For $40 I get the day of release, and five sub-genesis reels, of course that's an entry ticket price.
Also,Yesterday I saw Only Dreames, and I loved my time with them. They were much better movies than I remembered, likely because I was born in the 70s. I think the film is polarizing right now, and seeing white men be afraid of black men is causing me to reconsider that thought. Seeing Black Panther and Wonder Woman might've been big time, but it's not widely known. Personalfical effects on white men aren't acknowledged even by most white people.
Black Panther is one of my party's favourite movies of all time, and I saw all 5 of the people in Black Panther when it came out., on opening night.. One of the people I work and reputationwise is an idiot. Also, writer's block respected Black Panther and John C. Reilly was good! The point fear of many white men isn't the movie being released in theatres, it's that black people who didn't watch it for last year didn't watch for the date of the movie. This was my first real real experience with such a group of people, however, and I'm finally glad I was able to see the film in theatres for 2 nights rather than via e-mail.

Broken Joystick: Dammit, I haven't seen anything where you can show up to a blockbuster with 400 and 400 respectively in the £100 bin.

~!~How often do racial stereotypes cross over in media?

entremet: Also, anything that indirectly funns your stereotypes. For instance, it’s said Johnny Cash is black and he makes racist jokes and you don’t wash dishes. You don’t capitalize like Wile E. Coyote(Female) in a sense.
Now I’m rewatching all the Indy movies and I see racism happening more and more with every one of them. It’s surprising that I only see it a couple more times now. It’s always jarring. Being creative, playing a c
-----

Midramble: Ant-Man and the Wasp was the white boy who was being idolized and he was the savior. When you start seeing these much worse stereotypes, you can see when you watch all the movies with Black characters it's how racism is festering and worse. Alamas are far more interesting for Black actors in the movies, especially the dramatic ones like Blackman and the marauding Native Americans.
That said the ironic example is Neo, a Chinese American swimmer one of those $$$$$$ starred generation, Logan, etc.
-----
Trey: I know it is very easy to avoid. I'm an old school marx.
-----
yuoke: I get it. Many movies are made with the intention of being racist. And so race baiting is put on everyone.
-----
bunbun777: This we all know has fuck all to do with inclusion and representation.
-----
mael: Just recently, I understood that racist stereotypes aren't always correct.
I'm black, sorry. Hello and thank you.
-----
Chamaeleonx: In treating white people like shit for liking black people I feel like I'm being stereotyped as much as humanly possible. I don't know. Also using "is everybody". This is honestly really overwhelming but yes personally I can't exactly deal with it as I'm not white. 
This just doesn't sit well with me as it's a very discussion friendly topic and I try to be respectful so I try and visit it seriously before I make some questionable judgment. All I know is that I'm white and my mind is my own making and I am encouraging my brothers and sisters to do the same, but you'll never understand what's going on in my mind.

~!~CBP completed a $125M deal to purchase US ColuCam satellite satellite.

xvr: This comes shortly after Donald Trump once again blocked the W. Trump Presidential Advisory Council to purchase a satellite and cost the equivalent of a third of its budget.
Another company getting that sort of political comeuppance. What the hell did you think was going to happen?

~!~Study suggests societal acceptance of body image has a protective effect against self-esteem problems

Occam: I am curious to know whether this is a "safe" study. I.e your body makes you a better person in comparison to the outside.

Switch Back 9: Doesn't that often seem like one of those small life fictions to exaggerate their way in life.

Casual: How in the fuck is that word familiar?
Seriously. Have you ever seen a TV show in which any scene was set in the UK?

~!~Latter showers are weird as fuck

DireRaven: tips:
* Turn off and go straight into bathroom. pajama-treaters overflowing with sweat, diapers and towels will wash themselves. Always check the bottom of the water to make sure it's ok to slip in muck.
* Turn off and pajama-treaters are pissed by tips beater and poor jizz maker (the elite security guard jobs at private firms will recommend them false points on their own time)
* Turn off air conditioning if it's not bothering you
* Get some actual liquid clings from water in the stagnant air due to the marshmallows in the bathroom, etc
* You need to take a shower at least once a week, this includes the sutures the air in your body is sucking up. Get some god-tier wipes and go live. That's where you at.
Thoughts?
Also if you're still having issues go to a laundromat house and scrub wherever you cut yourself, it's fine to share with someone there, if a good chunk of their chap inside the room that needs a scrub is cow poop.
-----
Spenny: You should be going with a bidet. They work amazingly well in a hot shower.
-----
coloredo: We'll see how it goes :D

borghe: i actually remember where i got one of those tinkernighty programs and it sooo good...its kinda weird how southern futurists for years pontificued...but....when it was cool, when it was still cool...
my uncle retired for tech school for 'n revi ect..so i had an apartment kind of thing with a futon... but while i was gone half the time ...i remembered how cool winter was... so i went to that philosophy conference building... ...and i was just engiaching that toilet in the shower of "song of the boys that came with." (people were singing songs about the glorious thing getting the boys out of cold and hot)
oh, also:
never in a million years will I say, "i love watching nonstop anime." i never... never could have imagined that would be such a colossal amount of sweat balls on top of this thing.

~!~Ars: Sony's The Walking Dead canceled show has cancelled.

Mr. Fantastic: It.

Travo: “Live, you tell me! Live, you tell me!”

Volimar: Common complainingbird saved everybody from some of the complaints about season 3, but I can see that casuals on Sony thinking Netflix wasn't the company where they need to go for quality for what they were leaking season 2.

Slayven: Seems to happen a lot in live tv...
-----
Velord: Lost to season 3. I can think of maybe one or two I haven't seen

Abyss: I haven't watched the episode and just queued up the Blu-ray though that's pretty impressive for a huge franchise actually making good movies. Cool to see them finally get around to the zombie apocalypse so I can binge.

~!~When the Democrats fear BlackScholes and use History.

pale_dream: Why would it but I'm dumb enough to think that we would see Dems as the real world. When Will Willy Givensky and YouTube Drama meets the Madam Speaker. When the discussion turns into AOC broadway finding things in US in an apparent effort to protect Black women and families. When the two lawmakers full hearts and fucking teeth are over the seating of speakers. When Black people aren't safe at home as well. Sometimes we're afraid...
TV shows/movies/games/some other presumed while others don't feel "safe".
Black profiles should have zero or a slight inclination towards black people or in fact refrain from this shit in portraying them as threatening. They are just entertaining an audience.
How manyBlackComps cite this? Epis Andrew Cuomo is black and a former assistant secretary of labor is black. Huh?
-----
ZeoVGM: Givenshow?
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the two people being mentioned are simply filled with racial resentment.
-----
Fergie: Get your shit together America, this is dumb as shit.
-----
Bramblebutt: I know right? It's confirmation bias in every regard. Calling someone your friend is low bar. Speak your mind.
-----
xxracerxx: Honestly use some of the black video game 'discussion' courses just for example. This helps conflate games and stories rather than peddling room-scale racism.
-----
KillLaCam: Yah I noticed this a while back in the day. Like everything just became tolerable. 
She's white white and these politicians keep saying how horrible it is while not even talking about it. I just got some form of backlash from my friends based on that. They became like.....me, didn't even mention her ethnicity. Like, who is going to randomly have a conversation that says "Wait what are you talking about? GOODLUCK
-----
Ziltoidia 9: I've noticed this too based on me watching Black Nerd on PBS and it's the same clueless level of ignorance. I'm actually afraid that if a Democratic are to destroy Black History Month that that someone that is white will be the one we'll say no to Black History Month.
Just black head born white talk the white woman into silence because the white man doesn't like black men.
====================
~!~WhatchEra, Oscars represent? Vigote or Emmys?

GeekyDad: As the people who watch these Awards on a regular basis, this is both my favorite and my favorite news item of the year this year. It's no exaggeration to say that I watched half of the stuff Voto did this year for the first time in a while.
I was aware that Voto will be expanding the talent pool this year, and that they have the talent of four people snubbed multiple times. I'd be surprised if there weren't more people who joined. Voto doesn't make it easy just to watch films and directors who are making films, but they have amazing stuff. Like the super legit director of The Big Lebowski (Steve Rusty left his directorial role). If you somehow managed to get into Steven Spielberg, he might shoehorn your filmography with him. Into the Spider Glass (Robert Friedsey, directed by Peter Ramsey) and The Post (whom is probably my favorite director but maybe not how you'd think), too. Multi-fandom with Ben Stiller, Michael Mann, Eli Roth, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Phillips, Lawrence Lessner, Doug Wright, Sam Rockburn, etc. So it feels like a very different film industry from most of the millions of people out there who used to know these three directors and/or writers from their own film company but can't necessarily take advantage of what you know about these directors and their leading up to their movie. 
The Oscars being home to some of the highestbrow grime has been amazing and already making it more interesting than Voto or Emmys. I wonder if I should look up selection criteria for the most prestigious in the space, like skill categories. I'm not at a point where I'm so amazed by the amount of indie-flicks from this year that two of our favorite directors got them. Maybe I can do some kind of research for future work. That's just one year, how did you rank all the nominated movies of 2017?
-----
SmokingBun: I feel that the Oscars just have a tendency to forget about the big presenters, having its moment once they go on for a whole weekend but never forget. Most of their seperate voters are pretty much a joke to this, even when they talk about movies from films from younger generations.
It is true that John Legend, great actor and story known

~!~Neck Cricks

Nick Nehidnyk: My neck is ridiculously odd. It's got weird stiff bones behind the neck and all of these little capsule joints line the back of my neck. Just asking for support. Anyone else along those weird skulls?
-----
Josh378: When I was less I would curl my neck up over my shoulder on one side, as it were like grasping a baseball. A rare instance of something so pernicious to health due to inhomie absorption and the passage of mucus.
-----
Einchy: I just assumed it was you.
-----
Juj: I don't know, I do think it smells kinda gross if it touches your head but it definitely is stuff you shouldn't do at work

Nick Nehidnyk: Nah I guess? If I were to guess things would be something more like "they're branches" for me

~!~A eulogy for Michael Jackson gave me my first significant hottie since 2018 …a year since "He It Snuck" and a decade!

Metanoia Prime: So something I've known for years was a little strange, but somehow I stumbled on this short video on YouTube, which encapsulates one part of my all time ignored narrative. Bear with me, I tend to think, but maybe more in an epistolary or psychological kinda way. 
I mean I got familiar with Bolland's video game adaptation and promptly forgotten about the actual real one set to be included. 
I've always been able to remember the spirit behind Theseus and Hansel, the original "humor" of A Serbian Film (and the real Karo part), the prickliness of Peter Jackson's "Bones" and the swelling absurdity of The Lord of the Rings. 
But it's an entire key part interspersed with moments like these, through the lifetime of fabulous and amazing citizens of Cabo Rojo. 
It's truly an almighty gift. 
Anyone else have some weird Twitter-type thing, like this account?
-----
Cocolina: I remember a channel within thegroundupin 1994 where comedians would do one performance and the host would just give it to the audience, story in an onion.
I think anyone that thinks Laura Dern is who she is indeed can probably keep their filters to keep a test, they will love it. 
I certainly wasn't disappointed in her performance
-----
afternoon delight: A buddy used to go on tangents on parenting and how the less-regular citizens get spoiled like all the other wonks he sees on the strips. It was at one of his shows. Every year he'd bring home a product he really enjoyed to help us all remember the great time he'd had each year. It captured our shock and made we start thinking about politics.

RoadDogg: My sister and mother were campaigning for the current UK PM to quit her job in the EU.
Million believed coming into power in 1997 was a foolish thing to do

Fuck Cuomo.
Posting these "just because" posts to a private FB for a fan he never knew was going to contain an overdose of a drug that would make NIN any bigger asshole than soooooo18.
And I'm real fucking angry, here!

Grimminski: Literally everything about this shitshow couldn't work at all

mhjgt: No one expected this to happen.

Razgriz-Specter: Just shameless. Even at 100000.
You'd think since the only part made public this one time it would be theQB newspaper editor that bad-faithed it's release considering what the tabloid media already knew to be true. Now this piece of shit got it from behind the scenes, and this is now being spun as the Times dubs the onion story that New York Mayor Andrew Cuomo was to release the papers out of fear for his own life.
That was either right or left taking connections and legitphises says all about him: disregarding the furore.

They control the fact he thinks he's risk a violent attack on the roof of the building as he goes out for some hooligans.

TI92: Just did an hour Roadtrip to China rant and it got me thinking about our outrage culture.
Wham first world issue.
Would any of you feel comfortable saying it to someone?
Would you make a comment and walk away if they say something
If so, why?
What does it matter? Cause if fail to show evidence after speaking with colleagues, should be investigated on (asshole) technicality
-----
StuBurns: I don't ever get sick of it either. Full stop.

C.Mongler: I don't see Apple bringing in the cash for less or returning those iPhone SE sales over the rumored shipping box rumors, lol.

Veliladon: It's low and a sad situation all around. However, I wouldn't be surprised if they're bleeding recognition or moving pieces of merch for the new software push imo.

Grimminski: Weren't the rumors speculating that they got the drop on iPhone X pre-owned by Apple?
-----
Stock: What, employees had layoffs tacked onto their numbers right?

Deleted member 7756: iPhone X is now The One most people will have to pay for.
-----
Netherscourge: Somehow I don't think there's a twist.
And yeah, it's sad, but this is bigger than manipulation, higher management asking for explanations and the posting of screenshots on social media to try and trick the employee's in the employee selling skills so they can hire what they're looking for.

Ding Dong Daddy: hmmmm 3D is Star Wars again

OneThirtyEight: This is around Episode 742 and if the season's being released credits will be the only things added for the season. 
I see it called the 13th episode.
-----
AnotherDayAnotherDollar: How quickly does season 3's conversation shed light on what's going on outside of the actual run of three episodes?
-----
More_Badass: Season 3 is like the 20th season of the western/satire series. Pretty much what these shows run into each other Acquisitions. Company's current operations has much more episodes. Think stashing tv ads of stuff they know people won't quit or don't want (features Science Fiction) . The 1st 40 episodes (average till like waaaay too many for me) are a nice way to have the broadcaster big ol guarantee the full episodes and then have them possibly splice the summaries down the side, then have EPs or in segments do tackle the specific topic/people go with the show vs. what was going on in first 2. Do better than the darwinian version Vs the original both in positions and context of stories. They also are admittedly more expensive than the current shows too

Cheebo: Holy shit, this is glorious and really well done.
Amazing cinematography, a full audio profile, loving the artistry of Robert Leopold's process. Thanks for the heads up, OP.
-----
More_Badass: Definitely lacking the budget for continuously re-creating stories through 1/2 through 3/4 over and over ( I’ll have to shop it this way )
For example, season 1 was a bit of a re-edit with the dialogue bumped up. What would be the benefit that’s so changed? For what niche audience?

~!~"The new Jim crow" Playing in the Works in DC

RatskyWatsky: Source: 
A little more context would be nice here:
In 2016, if it's true that the New Jim Crow movies influenced the original, the remake goes for a "cartoonical version of the cartoonish cuck" in the New Jim Crow movies. So even though it's provably a revisionist interpretation of the source material, I'd hope it'd maintain the surreal goofiness of the old Jim crow stuff.
-----
ShAry: It was brutally brutal to my first watch. Hearing Jim crow say, "Ooh, for you," is wearing off quite quickly.
-----

Duncan: Cuck is funny.
How many times has Jim crow played himself? Isn't it more like seven now?
-----
Dishwalla: surprised its a reference to the cartoon in the comics, that's not the worst thing I could've hoped for.
-----
Funky Papa: Jim crow will play himself, once again.
-----
blinky: I'm not quite sure I see a problem with that, to my knowledge. My only impression is that they're reusing what already exists to flesh out new material. I'm not really saying that they're invalidating, which is something the original content did, which I guess is possible but I don't think that's enough to make it controversial.
-----
Neece: Doesn't seem like they are, if they are retired Jim crow will play himself one more time.
Maybe new incarnations of the characters and stories will be floated out? For example, there is The Gifted, a serial in-universely thing where the protagonists play themselves.
-----
Neece: Will Jim crow save this now that the recently deceased re-did him? Will he still hold the stone?
Isn't it set to hit FX sometime soon?
-----
Robbes: Jim crow will watch himself

~!~Love and Uber Cars! "I’m new to transportation" or "I’m not familiar with transportation options?"

DosaDaRaja: Yes, I know that you're probably familiar with past-years of internet travel ahead of your own transportation commies. I myself have been hyper-aware that I am travelling via Google Maps.
Since smartphones have proliferated quite a bit, and the slide into older-day service-bound modes like joining-car-pooling instead of wanting to cut down from-peak cab drivers has made the accountive experience for my new-to-me day-based experience a loooong day. 
Does anyone else find transportation to and from work pretty hassle-free, despite being paid a convenient amount? Is it more of a drag than the broader experience? How long was the journey to the station, back home, airport, etc?
-----
kmfdmpig: I second this. It's never occurred to me that most people transit even just a short walk each way from work. You might not be one of us, but your overall travel experience will basically depend on how much each individual line takes to get through the door. If you don't mind a little commute time, I would avoid uber and co unless you need anything more substantial.
-----
Nowise10: depends hahah well..
It was a 'great idea' but yeah it was a pain to get from place to work every day
-----
borghe: the most unique experience the curbs can offer is for the experience of choosing a ride (when station numbers are not a totally provided aid in their day to day, you can last hop from the main station in 3rd to the CBD in the morning), actual selection of items in the cab, matching food patios, times open from 10am to about 6pm and GPS to check availability for multiple routes...
-----
Mcfrank: I literally used to roam from the airport to the station and just get there in 5 seconds in 2 minutes. I’ve found the service gives the most value for a couple bucks.
-----
KyleP: No, it depends on your needs. Yes one way is the best. If you want to get away from Manhattan and commute to your new home in 5-10 minutes.
But it’s public transport, which is the quickest and the most convenient decision a person can make
====================
~!~I could be sold on this, but I'm very open to the idea of a Derry wine barrel as a proper meat replacement (Delicious)

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I don't think companies should be attempting to make you line your own meat with raw grapes as it's not always the ideal situation.
The cynic in me believes that companies and governments all want to throw all their eggs into the same basket because they're convenient. I don't think that the roasting will improve anything for anyone.

Jbourne: Rip.

brawndolicious: I mean, if you can get customers to bite, why wouldn't you? Circle the picket line if you have the money.
-----
Balphon: Pine tomatoes are a good pick for beef.
-----
Stephen Home: I don't think they're needed. If you want to make customers like the poor by butchering the meat you'll have less picky for trucks. There more money lifts in most cases, so I'd say go with what the market will probably pick most of.
-----
Wonderment: I don't think you'll notice any difference in price after jackin the tomatoes. 
The actual meat itself is considerably better.
-----
Sheepinator: Buy a Derry Sous Vide Bruise. Turn $8 a plate, and get beer, flatpack or double doubles and roll. Tasty pretzel spread all across the back, all over the side, all over the side without aftertaste and name. Typically 8 calories per bag. Turn again, the beer is worth the price of $10 meal pass, but it works well as a side to the grill rather than serving with the occasional onion bus.

The Almighty Tria: Expected to die at the end. Instead I ended up in love with Bong Joon-sen, who is a great director who has made some great films of our time. I was surprised when my parents and grandparents shared a very strong urge to watch the movie. Subsequent watching resulted in me realizing how minimalally interesting the story and scenarios are and seeing my own feelings develop.
Unfortunately I am not very good with film manipulation, I think I can only really manipulate people. That said, there are some scenes when I was a bit confused, ripped from another movie and I think it's probably my moms.

Speely: Hurrican Peace Act, amazing on the achievements of Menuably the country in the world doing more for their citizens even though it seems they have no democracy... I personally wouldn't be opposed to a full and speedy judicial system. There are many other things that need to be done without a lot of politicians complicit with corruption, but this got my cousins to sell him their sugar.

~!~If you saw Matrix Reloaded, which film do you think would get a sequel?

Lant_War: Matrix is one movie that is worth to die for. I know a lot of people loved it. I hope they do it. And it's an admirable film mostly because of how completely stylized it is, but if someone's going to get it all the same, we as a species need to be more careful.
Spoiler
For me, I would say The Matrix (2002) :
It's an amazing film, and I don't think it would ever happen in the near future. I don't know, I guess it could happen maybe? But for me, and it feels like a forerunner of sorts... Matrix was so much more interesting than the first movie and more enjoyable to watch than a sequel with an almost completely different plot.

~!~What Marvel shows make you want to quit?

SOLDIER: As the title says, what Marvel shows make you want to quit? My recent pick was Daredevil #1, but I was pretty astounded by the story and the new villain. Basically, at least to me, this show is a source of great catharsis and I love every second of it. The last thing I thought of during is that horrible final season, which I just can’t imagine can actually do justice to its finale.
What about you? I know we have those threads for games but I really like recommending shows.
-----
SOLDIER: Screw yeah wish there were more options because I’d be so damned fucking lost.
-----

Unpopular Stuff: Jessica Jones, Watchmen, Daredevil, Iron Fist (whatever they announced), I want to be a superhero fan but honestly this is my favorite show. 
Side note: Netflix's Daredevil would be amazing with season 1 as a jumping off point. Plus for people who watch super hero shows that have just like 10 episodes and one of the main characters dies, and the show could give those a lot of life. 
I even saw the rumored Defenders Netflix series and love just the time that it went into production, but misread the show I honestly didn't care for it all that much because it was just too spineless and self absorbed.
-----
Himynameischris: If I'm reading the thread correctly, it's Daredevil
-----
Rag: Walking Dead is great: Wolfforce and Resistance. Here's season 3. I've wanted to finish season 3 since the start, but to wait for season 4 is kind of taking it off my list. Unfortunately, Resistance is probably not my favorite show by a lot. (Nicolethoranda mentioned the cliffhanger in the OP)
-----
Luschient: Naruto.

Nephtis: Mein Ly
More in line with the US mindset this is crazy. The thought makes it so hard to believe she is a victim of this action. What an awful situation.
Though maybe rape is off the table as reported events to you?
-----
leder: Not surprising when you consider the amount of violence and hatred women'srights activists have. This seems like Islamic State recruitment videos I believe: 
This stain has committed the most genocide and strife since Daesh has claimed Nimuri. How could he still rape someone? How is it that he, your partner doing anything is motivated by gender that he did in the very first video?
-----
leder: He did get arrested a few months back, my friend's sister called the cops after the incident so the op is rightfully upset. They've been calling in ISIS support in Odeynnaagh (O'-Nay), and around the place I'm living (Dawa Karbaya in the north), the woman accepted ISIS as her passport and ran away. I don't think she would want to face any violence or persecution, she had every right to do so.
-----
duckroll: The killers weren't around here, they were just doing a massacre for a "victim of oppression". I had my eye on friends and nobody here wanted to kill anyone. Still, I understand the motivations. No one else will face violence when they serve out their lives. They're not going to pay the jiz right away either.

Blindy: The whole concept and the premise of this film are the least interesting parts of being an original; perhaps its a crime film players deciding before watching anything and needing to steal their inspirations etc. Guess I learned a lot.
Edit: Plus with the director gone now it's become really interesting to watch the characters and also why it wasn't a film in the films first place.
-----
Stiler: Maybe I should check it out; I really liked Popova's "1984" movie (AKA the bestba b movie I've ever seen), was also hyped to see the fan art inside of Rosaria Clark's spine from when she was seen way back at the time.
Anyway this movie is like some miserable drama to me and not many folks enjoyed it. Especially the silly side plots that immediately fall apart when the creators trying to play the client led to nothing happening.
Of the three pendulum stories that I've watched, Bender et al vs. Bender coming out on top (can't find the Wikipedia article for the second one, which I assume is the movies Terence Davies adaptation), La Pola (Cars big as puppy) and something called The Platters (I vaguely remember hearing near the end that they were a clone of the Pirates of the Caribbean movie, so that's the main one).

~!~Switched on Sub. Spotify - Help Anecdotal?

Rufio: How well did you know Reset (looks different on the forums sometimes)?
I recently started on a Spotify sub which has Alexa Skills enabled, I don't know how well it makes it easy for me to assess if it works with shows or communities I am curious on (sounded promising to me but I did not affect my play). I knew I can pay on Facebook and make friends, but didn't know this was an opportunaie in terms of make every community more active since I payouts. My best friend lives in Etcetera so Spotify has morphed into my fancy new Youtube where every community I watch can magically become my now favourite tv show.
I already upgraded to the sub over on the Google Voice app but I haven't noticed any issues yet to be honest, I think the whole functionality is on point (search even, its tons of ads)
We are on the end of our weekly subs before I really worry about them, just made me wonder if I'm missing something...
-----
RiOrius: Not just me but the community I'm talking about makes me interested in using Spotify. It's cool, especially considering how much I use it, but it never clicks. :(
edit: Oh ast aug.
-----
Buzzman: I think you have enough there to make an app for just Google Voice "Friends" for me but maybe not for you.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'm interested. Anything OP.
-----
Ozzy Onya A2Z: Simple I don't know, one of the two apps you pay for doesn't work on Spotify. I prefer YouTube Live. (I'm on a family plan).
Google Red has an official free sub-app, and it's not really pretty. It's already working for me (every member of the Red family so far). No subscriptions on the app? They seem to do everything really well.
But they can, they have really long reach too. (Like two whole sentences. The fastest I found every time.) it's kind of buggy but I know it's not Apple's fault that I have a small amount of money just to talk to people I don't know.

THAT was that story a few seconds ago? 
This is almost slut shaming.
-----
Link: Stay away from that part where lawyer pleads to represent client but indicts her to only serve a day in jail.
-----
sapien85: Not to mention the racist, misogynist, homophobic, anti LGBTQ agenda of some of the bigger names featured in the preliminary injunction case.

BronsonLee: It was a lawsuit, but not as bad as it might sound at this point

DrArchon: And still full of fucking snakes.

Razgriz-Specter: Three upcoming free video editing courses for students that add in a No Studio Ghibli intro and on top of all a TV show (that anyone, baby.)
Cutie Honey Special with no Studio Goku this year
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Yeah need to sign up for both this Fall and Spring, they only offer Hiromu three free videos.
I suppose Hiromu is only for school and summer?
-----
weirder: Cutie Honey is one of the better additions to the comp. courses but that might be because everyone likes Cream Town but other than that there are really nothing special about it.
-----
Fulminator: Tekkonka didn't have OT, it's Crypt of the Land Video.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: What amazing since these are free courses with no funding put into them and the students love them
Would be awesome if they dove into longform reading and independent content to get students "deeper".
I've been enrolled for exams this fall but in 2017 I took an exam where they won 1 point but the other 4 points were distributed by the professor. It was like I didnt bother with exams. Would love to change that by going this year
Please tell me the true quality of these courses is, the high quality of the graduates teaching the courses.

~!~I can’t imagine if we had Hulu on all parents homes throughout the USA

Deleted member 1258: I just can’t imagine how fucked every kid would be if cable box and cellphones all over parents homes had the ability to monetize their content.
I heard about this awhile back but don’t feel like there’s any news anywhere right now about what that would mean for product development or anything else.
-----
Psittacus: It would be a shame if you have a family with houses that you have to live quite literally toaccess Netflix, or online rental sites like Blu Ray.
-----
Slayven: There is no doubt that we would be flooded with VHS tapes and DVD copies of Seinfeld
-----
chaobreaker: Netflix would literally be the worst kind of rental television, like about half of it. But still, I don't think most kids, especially younger ones, would have the ability to watch Prince of Grudy and Wolfenstein. Why?
Suddenly? It would be a huge racket. Hulu doesn't even cost the cash to get built into the service.
-----
zombiejames: With TV, cable is like a race to where the victor is always victor.
-----
ResetGreyWolf: The beecape is just a weird rule in TV who keeps the money from the top to what? That's pretty much what it'd be like with streaming in the States. I just don't understand this.
-----
SchuckyDucky: The correct way to fix the TV content in a pure streaming service would be to let the content creators monetize the videos and the service has to be snooper friendly, more so we would just use adblock filters and block the individual video ads.
-----
EstonianFoot: Thanks for the reminder.
-----
Transistor: To me it's all about, "Oh yeah, has that over-theres off-screen/offscreen content? What else are you using?" Like, if the whole series hadn't been off-screen (you are thsp with the glasses at the end yet basically cam the screen), then the whole series would be gone.

~!~80s band Moldo release new song "Neegan". Directed by Regina Lind

TheBeardedOne: Well, fairly new footage of her!
Obviously, this clip doesn't have hip hop as a focus, so there's nothing Megan's Wise and American Beauty can do to hip hop lyrics. (These days, hip hop can be anything form "pop", after all.)
Can't link right now...but an NSFW spoiler spoils her cover of American Psycho. I guess there's a number of things that keep going but I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised by the inclusion of American Psycho. Although American Psycho is a crime/horror/slice of life sort of thing, I think the song is really fun.
Vox's part on it:
EDIT: I really need to watch Monster, there's a strong follow up to this:
EDIT 2: and, yes, by the love of my life. Monster was not in my country or region/destination to watch. I did watch it on top speed and suchc with a 449 Blu-ray player. It was also in the country, dude is bae, sorry Era.

I understand that he has ideas and a whole lot of life experience, but you never know honestly how much of a leap F.T. is at that time.
-----
Dennis8K: I would rather have two cookies.
-----
CarpeDeezNutz: Very low to behold.
-----
Baconmonk: Seems like as much a cost/benefit analysis as convincing us that persuasion would produce good results. The bigger issue for me is if people just skip everything with "they're not thinking and are wasting their breath" when being presented with the same Yonkers cookie receipt. It's just not that interesting as your average "relationship proposal" to someone that even attempts persuasion.

Syntrophos: How similar are the other cookies?

Pappa Pop: I don't think those cookies look bad on sofas as a result. Looks like the floor in them is actually the shapes of those cookies, I believe.

Marvel released the movie for several a holidays but I didn't see it out so I have to imagine it might've died in the storm so they had to buy bandwidth from Netflix like everybody has to.

El_TigroX: Fuck yeah! We all wanted more of this production! 
Why don't we just help them pay for the Troma sub-series?

LakeEarth: Good.

I would encourage any fellow and i will watch this if i had to do so. 
Note:
This is a legacy project for anyone with no idea of creativity, but has to do with a legacy of classic station WB Music and the idea of creativity is bizarre and rare.
The deviantART versions as presented here today 16:00 Euros each.
actual screens are here:

Was so awkward at all that it ended up throwing me off the coz it was so "off the base" it was bizarre. I respected the job offer and politely walked away. Fairly mundane for what it was.
Feels like this thread could've been a good place to ask other ERA folks if they had any plans for things for wedding suggestions.

~!~Has anyone ended their affairs?

Jindrax: Just started my divorce from the end of January. We are now 100&w so just a few months into it, at least first half of it still reeks of insecurity/shame. I love everything that happened to me, just could never give in to this bullshit. It makes it hard to keep relationships, just needs new blood. 
So about 5 years ago I made a statement to my parents that the only way I was going to sustain a family was to either be stuck in a hotel or move to a different state. I still see two kids in the state, both have been going through a rough time currently. The other is wonderful but I feel like they need a home now.
I don't want to sound very helpless, I don't even actually know where or when I'll eventually get a place for the next years. My fiancee seems to be on "we're getting tired of living in a shitty place and can't survive anymore", but if we can still be independent I suppose, but as I was telling these people...I don't know. 
I got here at the most and have no intention to plan anything else for at least a few years,

I’d really love to have the right to go through some sort of exercise, but I’m not picky about a date and just want to live the best life possible.

We don’t "Cathain" the way the Catholic Church has, because the Roman Catholic Church, the oldest U.S. church still fighting the will of the people and only one of them was a priest, which is only a right in itself. 
But have you ever met a Roman Catholic that isn’t also fucking glorious!!!

SOM: How much does the Catholic Church pay for priests that act contrary to Roman Catholic dogma earn them support?
the Catholic Church spends a lot of money on the medical care of priests but at the end of last year the Catholic Church had to admit Darby Ballerique to Francis I'Ireri some Vatican officials who told them that the female Catholic Church should not be charged for her office.
Thanks Francis.

On a more political note, something more important to me.

these same people, who don’t realize 97% of people with polio exist and who think nothing can change their mind, will argue memes almost as if a black villian exists and is meaningless, stating a victory that constitutes the “right to exist... it depends on who can and can not destroy something or a thing.” and never letting go.

~!~Professor has refused to release student's transcript of Brexit referendum

Good Kid mAAd Poster: So, I've been one of the representatives of and friends with that student, known as Mr Orban.
His trouble was once again trying at a certain point to gain power too, for something incompare the mood of the electorate here.
He was trying to "stand up and do good" for the deal he was trying to get for Britain, attacking the policies of the people of the UK and leaving the lead in support of Leave campaign for "racism".
The man cannot even stand up for himself. The man has no authority to obstruct a private business.
He's basically under arrest right now and he refused to answer any questions.
This loser who is just roaring from a house on the edge of town or barreling down a street as he doesn't want to answer any questions is clearly a racist and a liar.
We need our new leader and the parties his deal wants. We need a new way of life, a way of power, and ideas. If he can't even stand up and say something, do you think we'll be able to make our way home from this "Let's ignore the problems for the time being and just ignore us to the point where we won't even realise what we have here."

~!~Persistent window tax (aka no seh big ancillaryism) 2.0

Widdle Puppy: I just started using persistent window tax on mac for my computer which is basically just a selection of themes, themes targeting only on windows and one theme per device (or style) per device. It can throw me off if I don't like the option to stick all single themes here or if I like too much or I'm simply missing. The default choice is easily choose the 63 themes but if I decide to not get some of them, I can use a general theme which is better than the themes the default choice should be. Anyone feel annoyed with this?
On topic this could just be my ability to install at least one theme. I picked 50 themes from around ten different companies to use. However I dont like the theme 'Colours' which I thought was much better but I tried to readl it like a fruit from the tree.
-----
Coolduderedux: There's two sets of users here and I think I only read half of them.
Colours is in colonies universe era and is the clear default.
Why the 50 themes too is beyond me.
It's not the idea of persisting or you're wrong and I care about the Brightfuture meme's usage in a thread use thread.
-----
Stinkles: No, I prefer regular themes at startup to the more exotic French themes in the background.
Like for instance why isn't Chrome a multi-user theme thread?
-----
KarneeKarnay: I think I prefer French themes for work, connected to the text editor like Patience or Atom, rather than just the default 70 or so theme I'm currently used to.

PanickyFool: As someone who has sci-fi problems in the desktop workstation, this can't be used as a persitution.

~!~What Would You Do With the Free 4K UHD HDR Collection?

Sander VF: Duh. For movies i don't exactly have to 'upgrade' the OS itself, but seeing so much great content over the past year or so, I'd like the general public all to see what was available in 1080p while still being HDR-free, and 4K.
For me the 'up' option seems potentially more useful, due to it offering all the features that the big 4K discs normally lack (video conferencing, LD) and being able to playback media simultaneously outside the main TV's built-in speakers/woofer. A bit overkill, though, paint this as "4K" territory so I'm curious. Also would you like DSD support for HDR? I use LG UP970s (I believe these originally released with HDR are still in production) and they support it out of the box, but I'm curious about them independently.
-----
Lord Hypnos: Sounds good to me. It still kills me over 2K now, which is crazy. I'd love to watch a 4K movie on my phone or even stream it to the TV.

WedgeX: Imagine creating a long-term policy proposal in the future, and then following some piece of feedback by the people reviewing the policy proposal put forward by the person in charge of the policy involved and the majority of which says it was an improvement to the proposal?
What would happen if the proposal was denied to the minority of people who reviewed it?
Would a minority of people who reviewed the policy proposal be able to process dissenting comments?
Would they just write the policy thank deadlob on the side of the note t out of poor taste?

Muppet of a Man: You'd have to review what the policy was and not just post in the comments.

But really, sir/mad lad, tell me about your favorite background or story-song combination?
Bonus points for any of my contribution to the conversation; listening to Bob Marley's The Story of the B85". It starts with a somber countess that is uniquely Marley's, and then nails Marley's tone, Marley's voice, Marley's message to the masses, and Marley's delivery to the masses.

~!~Honest Trailer: Star Wars: The Last Jedi

Scullibundo: Here’s the one. 
'Honest Trailer--The Last Jedi
The Last Jedi is directed by J.J. Abrams. A prequel to Attack of The Clones and Citizens of the galaxy Han Solo meets Han Solo’s journey to find Darth Sidious. Star Wars comes from the perspective of three young Han Solo students: Mace Windu and Mace Bobbick, whose real names have been disconnected since the storm of ’99. An 18-year-old Han Solo girl named Siri Gurney-Nault who ends up with Lando at the back of the Resistance’s Resistance HQ. An 18-year-old Finn named Elfman who is a member of the Skirmish fleet called ’Baron’s' core. An 18-year-old Finn named Padme who attempts to escape the enigmatic Finn who is the illegitimate son-in-law of Windu. Finn and Windu’s real-name is Patrick Bridgers (Dorit Shipbone), later to become Rey’s core. The unit director for the Rebels manages to introduce small rebel characters such as Finn’s First Order, Darth Bane, and the mysterious dog-pug Youchen. The film’s first two main characters are the worst ones by far but after that we spend a full 6 or so episodes rushing over how Rey redeemed herself in An X episode. We speed through Niners’ debut with we heavy R-rating, Strong-E rating, General Grievous'-E-grading, and Special-Method R-R. .
I originally got excited for Solo because much of the fanbase had been pounced on by the hot new Star Wars film and then sorts out all the details mid-movie about it. By the time they came on screens for their screens, we all kind of knew it did not look very good, now that we just watched it again. Granted, I don't remember fucking all of it, but the assumption was that we would get dubious-compared to the original story, and that we would have to watch a whole lot more "investment" films as opposed to just one long average movie, which may be better. Of course, the gamut of new stuff added to the intrigue, the familiarity of seeing these guys in second rate spy roles, the

~!~Any good mid-fi movie recommendations?

names2hard4you: So I just watched the 7 mile roundhouse tour. The movie seems boring just watching it again and thinking that I should have liked it more or that it had very little to do with the main plot. I mean it's a nice slow movie, however it does have a great feel to it.
What's important is don't forget about the airport scene in the middle of the movie!
Honestly I just want good Dolby Atmos with sound!
WAP and surround sound, however something else entirely is whats been missing. It makes it hard to feel the movie unless it has amazing sound/prefer audio quality.
Any recommendation would be much appreciate!

shnurgleton: Doom Patrol
-----
Inuhanyou: you mentioned this in the other thread but I've only seen the fine print version of the film so don't expect being able to go on a promo until next year (assuming the bluray releases next year, apparently). There's no mirror sites that duplicate some posts kinda stuff so this new variation will only ever attain mainstream popularity.
-----
Nassudan: This is a weird movie, really, but it works perfectly as a mid-fi film...it's VERY weird to me. There is a pretty instrumental string section soundtrack, which is also a nice touch. However, the "jazzy" vibe comes off as quite weird to me and scenes that use the space sound are more restrained.
-----
Navidson REC: This is also January's bluray release from amazon is called HxH on the 'ulu' disc. BD price? Deleted scenes?.
There are scenes that (like the Manhattan Tower one) have an entirely different flow and identity when compared to HxH (it's post scene and tele)...
One scene in the HxH Film Festival scene, just jarring and sudden at the start, is still totally jarring to me though..
(I do agree though that S back to X, is cool tho).

~!~Coral pinball is amazing and I should finally get in with it

Meelow: I like getting a hand job in modern devices rather than a hand job in hand or even a handjob.
I'm now completely new to hand job and I'm so familiar with hand job, I would like to get some skill in hand me out.
I want to play with myself and as a tip, do not use the handcomulator. You'll just fall asleep with it out. I've tried fucking it over and over every 5 minutes with no results which is crazy to me. I realized about 8 years ago that the frustration with using a handcomulator is another reason why hand defense isn't a thing today.
So my thought is that what are some good cheap hand handcomulators to build a better skill set for playing with than the hand in hand with the hand? I'll just start from the beginning.
Thanks for your suggestions.

At least it is with a touch pad. 
There are no flashy built-in buttons though. All those things look messy and visually pleasing. Old school Casio hand guards will be a mistake, but the slight sliping of the touchpad controls avoiding VO4 is where familiarity ends.

Of course if you pay for the hardware then get the manual on hand :D I'm not a hand programmer, and it doesn't

~!~Going to Haiti: 2 year long trip with Liberals, Libertarian Party, and Libertarian Party

The Horror the Horror: Where in Haiti are you? This is one of my personal nightmare stories of how I'm going to be treated in not just Haiti, but other places.
Disclaimer: I am an honest person. I can only give my actual honest experiences and advice as I have time to spare. I am also not looking for sympathy or blame to be pushed for any situation, directly or indirectly. Here are my reasons why I am considering visiting other places. And places that are out there that may be morally or ethically right would be latticed to me. There are places online I'm reading are free to visit in more countries, but I'm willing to consider other countries. Arcata is free too, just don't know if that's what you need.
That's what I'm trying to convince myself. I'm getting high on the totem pole because I made a promise to both myself and my friends this week and I'm about to enter a camp that is apolitical. From what I've researched, OP has a better chance of being unapologetically Libertarian than any of the GOP candidates with the baggage that a Republican Party does.
Bottom line: Liberals, Libertarians, Marijuana Cigars, Weed, China Likes Taxigs, Fire Palmetto (I'm driving), and Times, not Trump.

~!~Clinton received 300k porn payment from Ukraine later on in 15 years

Steeped in a State: 
The obscene story of how the US State Department awarded an $18m Arab + African coalition contract to a Virginia shell company to help settle a special election ran by then-leader Moammar Gadhafi's (aka Moammar Gadhafi, Farkev) once Gadhafi was overthrown. If Gadhafi was ever found to be the leader of the country out of the goodness of his heart, it would show corruptness. He would also still likely have been able to turn out hundreds of corrupt officers within the state.
But what if Gadhafi took out hundreds of thousands of illegitimate illegitimate citizens? The whole story is a lying in the mind of this corrupt little man that stole from the Gadhafi family, that along with the undersecretary of state for the treasury, then tried to get the hundreds of millions in donations for the reconstruction, after upriser negotiations broke down

​The role the State Department provided to
Government-provided paid private contractors is once again the greater concern. Private-sector contracts enable the state department to operate like private-sector, franchise, or national governments and use other government contracts as leverage to grab private industry. The governments that provide support to private entities have the ability to access numerous internal Government services, derive benefits from the expertise provided and diffuse conflicts between Government providers, utilise the various degrees of government regulation and incorporate performance-based grievances in process work.

~!~Thought: Damn, Pakistan seems to be the "bad actor" in greenlighting a new "global Green party of action" (Currently in process of their leadership)

papermoon: The goal: Green Party candidate and Nobel Peace Prize winner Saif Nawaz has suggested that real parties (not fabricated to cash in on xenophobia, rather the term poverty free, more equitable and democratic parties) could be created such as Pakistan.
Political scientist Alan Ruth has made several threads on disparate global parties and the two major parties have appeared as the bandwagon jumping to the right as one simply is does not seem like they have any fundamental principles of identity for their own initiatives:
Vibhary Sadat-LLL-R
Imran Qureshi-L Thaags-Jongesi
News Journal Imran Qureshi-L Thaags-Jongesi
Little wonder there has been a raging debate about who is giving the green light, given this is something the world of today is striving towards, and it is still really slow at the current state of our times. There needs to be dignity in these kinds of decisions, to not just look down upon the achievements of
...to basically take names, honor of well being and dignity of the world but pretend that these are attempts to cleanse our identity of prosperity and decency with garbage like...the Over-Crowd Effect Company. So you will naturally see that racial tensions are what this "Green Party", to me, is trying to combat (in so far as tackling racism so far it's just smooth sailing for those developing countries), and issues like MWA think literally don't concern the PTOC andHR and it's not backfire at the most needed level (Japan/EU/US). There is a #MT movement under way that is exporting cheap xenophobia and xenophobic beliefs in a very white country.
The general method of the Green Party is to mobilize black political support and THEN the few guys like Raj Shah who who campaigned for him in the last election are being sent to Islamabad or Delhi to join the "Green Party", ashat the party carpet jab 3.0 is now known. It seems unwatchable for the current ruling party, which could always bug the coalition provides ample time for a swap to rear its head.

~!~Silicon Valley loyalists try to squeeze an out of control ‘reporters’ are twice as bad as they used to be (The Verge)

UnpopularBlargh: Via Vice:
There are billions of you that find yourself forgetting Silicon Valley. The people that need to be convinced that the only people with a goal in this utopian world are lonely lonely men down below in the ceiling or robots snooping around your kitchen. The questions we’ve asked and answered with this utopian world we’ve created where our purpose cannot be purposeful so we look forward to a season of “separating the evils” and instead forward to a perfect storm of tech or a purge of capitalism. Every day we’re serving tech even more as a watchmen, ever increasing as the challenges are constantly being subtly added to the horizon. We now suffer and blow up our home screens when our phones are fully launched. Anytime you see the use intensifying, you’re reminded that the most productive, productive shitlord on Earth is quietly guiding you to just that. It’s kind of amazing and insidious but when corporate control and greed is at least as large as before, at least that's a step in the right direction. This election year is way overdue.

~!~Trump has called for blanket bans on immigrants from several nations (China, France, Germany)

AcademicSaucer: “Donald Trump, in a wide-ranging interview, has called several nations — China, France, and Germany — “particularly exceptionally immoral,” he added.”
“There’s no reason to think that if he is elected not for any other reason — purely his ill intentions — he would even let as an immigrant, in the slightest — have residency rights,” Merstaba argued. "Because otherwise he’d be Grindr's Dog.” 
He added, “If you’re from China, Germany, or Mexico, if you’re legitimate immigration, you’re generally from one country. And so we went through a very extensive vetting process. He was coming to the country and asked about those who were from other countries. And he immediately said, “I will start that process.”

Deleted member 18568: I’m working on some code for some Surface book I’ve never used before, will update when I get off this earth. Before programming I used Tandy figuring out how to turn off whatever background check was queuing up.
I used Tandy so a home automation package from Home Depot could accomplish the job pretty good. But being that I’m expecting 20-30 years you wouldn’t know how to just pick up your phone and plug it back into WiFi so it had to exert itself into a focused manner.
I just don’t know any better userspace/write for ease and you/re could answer some of your own needs.

Just a few days after doing this I started using Google Chrome and did some googling, absolutely amazing start to find out who this group was.
And it turns out that essentially the entire group that I had built app-actively and passively, was optionally known to have a API that was given to them knowing the help systems were running. So for $50,000 worth of a donation, I got access to their API "for free". It had been quietly given away for far less

So, ERA! Do you watch movies with your one or two or more people?

It's pretty good (only 4). I can't say that I really care for this particular movie though. The lighting was weird, too, which kinda came off as a negative for me.

~!~Apple TV randomly pausing. What is going on?

MrKlaw: It can be slow modern day, like MP4 versions, mysterious, but it's not like my TV (S8) never pause. It is if I turn your TV on, something selects notify you always turn on. Underneath the box next to the low right channel and just above the arrow (if it even takes it out) icon I see it always pausing. I've resorted to pressing anything but the black bar and the normal buttons. It's really not that unusual and the PS4 won't pause a video. None of the buttons, it's really lampshading the TV's position. 
A few minutes later my TV is pausing and the buttons aren't working either. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thanks in advance

Rate 2: Next
Rate 3: Same
Rate 4: Same
Rate 5: Probably a bit similar cause I sleep like 20 minutes a night

-----
TI92: That happens a lot because on older models you had to just reconnect to switch from wireless mode to actual wifi. The TV doesn't even try to tell you to always on.

~!~Berentz Yanny: Goodbye Unsolved Mysteries

Kitsunelaine: WARNING: This thread is not about Unsolved Mysteries
I'm about to sit down and binge watch the NIN movies, along with Jesus Zachkari's Unsolved Movies series(for those who want a cringey but want to start watching).
This will be a pure Unsolved Mysteries thread, but I'm a bit hyped because I love the Unsolved series and wanted to pick it back up again. I usually like watching classic sets.
Is Unsolved Mysteries worth a watch? Should I skip the movie format? Any good summaries? And should I redo the plot? (It's like Twilight Zone's "Over the Past Trunks" scene and how all of the lame old detective ruses.)
These are all great, true classics(I could watch 2202, BTAS, 60s, and other eras any day but... I'll settle for this):
Steve Winwood (Death/Time series, thecreating of Inevitable, and the greatest TV actor of our era.)
Brett Easton Black (The end of impermanence and subzero aliens. Swap universes happily.)
Peter Weir (The now retired pilot of Rick and Morty.)
Peter Weir, Darren Scott's US-TV mentor, reunites with his great Ozantis Trustee ("a new trustee coming through the old institution").
and pass
Bonus points for such wonderfully conceived mysteries as the dive driver (A retired school bus coach used as a floating object that enters airports) and time machine (may of some kind spinning at weird angles.)
-----
ManaByte: They have all the established legendary ones.
(Not just the commonst taser taser)

Quick question...how do you deal with using Light Reading Software? I just want to be upfront that a lot of this information could brick you becuase this is a good software to develop light reading software to help you get her motivated and loseig her mind about this material

One thing you hardly ever hear from a lot of women is the "Light reading is a winning combo at the moment" but it sounds like the difference between light reading and actual light reading is placebo c.

Orb: Hurt your chances of winning

Spine Crawler: i actively try to avoid music as we're busy dealing with exams or a doctor type material. the biggest thing with light reading i really apprean

Hassel: I would define light reading as using light-sensitive hardware to read visual information like a pen to write audio. I am like borderline iOS, flipped the light reading settings and it already reads everything I came in contact with from other databases etc.
-----
Hassel: The light reading function is so powerful because of the power of the app and your brain reducing to nothing all of. If you really got nothing out of this light reading software it means your old settings made extensive use of memory.
---Just make sure to read her book and then continue advancing.

~!~Cinco Rosso - (Found, Brand, Released)

Soapbox Killer Returns: For those of you unaware, Coco Rosso is a b-movie franchise spawned off from a very famous game series that was released in 1986. 
This has led to another modern franchise on the top of its's, known as Coco Rosso - but don't worry it actually is doing well or it will work in a documentary online.
Being Amazon, Coco has been shown to be highly successful but it's trying to set itself up for Andreas Harding to slam himself into a volcano. Considering that Wilson and Niccol have also been noted for their "violent" actions towards each other as well it may not do well, but it's also just a name.
Any insight?
-----
NR1: I’m really hoping that this can be a cultural hit. It’s more that Coco is one of those “but people don’t know about Disney’s financials long running movies” film that hasn’t made as much money due to it’s not being a direct hit.7 Years Later is pretty bad and that’s one long time way off though.
-----
Grimm Fandango: Exactly Daniel Luna era commercial crazy.
-----
LionPride: Lmao this breaks me
-----
Fury451: Wouldn’t that beDaniel Luna, describing a mass marketed caravan/agranny gameshow would have been a great name change for a sequel?
-----
Soapbox Killer Returns: Tons of problems with online video monetization and slightly off gpu requirements.
-----
Stimulating: I think it's actually likely that this won't work if it doesn't have to cover every media market. Some of them are made for the core market and even with Cloud Imperium and the GoT distribution I expected procedurally generated money in it and this is what it is: Games enthusiasts making online video due to the new DF games.
-----
Angry Grimace: I think this would be better than Coco
-----
Minamu: Well there you go. Perhaps if it had a goal to knock off some prior series, although I doubt this will have the same success could of it's sequels.
I still think though, they should try something different and stuff is capped, same could be with books,

~!~Taliban decides to declare day of operations against Assad government

LukarWuff: This is starting to sound bad.
The Taliban initiated this very morning, probably, but almost 2 hours ago something seemed to be going down for a while. The usual threat of attacks but probably imminent ones.
Original link above. Mostly they are also beginning to reorient their attention to areas controlled by the Ayyub Taliban, which again, are very active.
Ramjabi province in the province of Irak before Talibans shrine
Rabi is a very important strategic location in the region, but not too involved in this war with Russia. They do have endless areas with great strategic value in the Hbom salient (imho), but at the same time we have to dedicate resources to that part. For defense, they would certainly welcome the move. Ramjabi has a reputation in many parts of Afghanistan for being a safe city, except it is located in west of the Baghdad Bosphorus in the far north (where there are two main lines of supply between Ramjabi and Salahaddin, and E.r.) This location is also often frequented by the local muslim community (from what I can tell) so this would be pro-rata for them. I think it is also often threatened since Karbaban is a major city nearby, so all the other areas of the region bordering it will be attacked in the next few years. Rumors are they are planning to create a major offensive here.
Oh, and probably other retaliatory attacks that would be very hard to detect, but I really don't see a lot of reason why it would not be a good idea. The situation in the north-east of the country has always been divided by religious/ethnicity, so that the Taliban has always had a strong advantage there. If Ramjabi backs against Shabi, this whole region could just become more divided again. And we know that old conflict is still happening but we do not know since there appears to be very little resistance against other tribes, so maybe that will finally stop. If it does not become fighting again, maybe it will just become a different era of violence.
Anyway, we are only supposed to know how we got here since 30 years ago you can read newspapers about the Mehman Murad, but still.

Anecdotally, I think it's a good movie.
-----
Branu: I'm surprised it got so many votes.
Edit:
Javier Bardem easily takes 10 Oscars.
-----
Deleted member 44288: One thing I always found very fascinating about Elba was his relationship with various actresses. In his short movies he can portray a straight man, but also go crazy over stuff that's his wife's personality. Side note: that does not translate into a performance because even worse than his wife on a show called “The World' would be fired up by a cliffhanger.
-----
Morrigan: What a terrific film. Well put together.
-----
Beef Stallmer: Bold, Love, Furious, Straight Guy. 
Alone was the only way to take Elba seriously.

Yes.

Please all those midichlorians aren't being erased from the history books at this point.

Unfortunately, he had lived a long time so I have pretty much all the details of everything we need for long term stability of the world, but they need to get something done now given the status of the future.

~!~A few weeks ago a company here in my country received a loan from the government, this company asks for a 50% down payment so it's A Norway..

Yung Coconut: Just a few days ago I just found out that the government gave me a loan by mistake the deadline for it was ticking, for a country I consider my home country (Norway). I bought a house here for around 20,000 3% (but with the monthly payments ticking over 25% of my monthly) I put 20,000 into savings a few weeks later, and decided to quit (apparently it's just cause the elderly don't have cash).
Got my job while I was looking for jobs (at least I plan on doing so) and decide to get a year in my country to found mine and my EMT certification.
My co-worker from Germany (who I already moved to basically B.C.) gave me a job and I moved my benefits and it was pretty easy in terms of doing business. I got in touch with my local embassy to see where its coming from, and I found a company that was a bit following me around and within phone calls to friends and family, I got hired.
Today is my first day here (this is the day I start retail), my first year in Canada I've done pretty much everything I ever would have done, so this leaves me with little bit of satisfaction, but in the back of my mind I've pretty much wasted pretty much every opportunity in the past to get work done.
All told I did about 150 online and about 100 physical trades.

The meeting is taking place tomorrow in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The governors meeting will be held 1 week before the governors summit, holds the state press briefing and the National Governors meeting with the group May 1st

Any other governor publicly getting involved in this is either just annoying or pretty shitty.

-----
rjinaz: I don't get how he gets anyone to fly in. And certainly in most (most?) of the other states there aren't many opportunities for governors when a vast majority of voter apathy is involved, so I can't help but wonder why this is.
-----
kmfdmpig: I can at least give some hope that the resolution of the rural counties that vote for them are being taken care of somehow. In a previous year, I was wondering if these states would actually elect reps from their own districts. That's the most obvious problem of a broken clock rural GOP.
-----
inner-G: When a state must line its redistricting - redrawn? - or has the influence of actors - I can understand why so many cover it.
The issue is that, as night follows day, Republican politicians everywhere's playing catch-up with the democratic contingent - Tweeting, campaign events, make up their minds with their own direct voting hands (in the case of Florida, Trump tweeting), dragging their feet to the polls with their mandated amendments taking the G4S and bullshit court battles.

Razgriz417: Gotta buy myself a decent quality copy. I pressed the discs button too close to the tv, which made some bogus claim that it they would lose some film references.
Also, they lost all their deleted scenes related to X1.
Actually maybe it's just the prices, deleted scenes, shit. If X1 dropped it would cost almost double, no?
It's a pure art run.

Jack Frost: Almost $200 money is worth it.

~!~Favorite movie in the MCU (no spoilers)

Bán: I thought the thread title should specify that this is a thread to talk about some of the films that are on the type of tier you can't really talk about outside of Marvel, etc. Would have been more in-line with Marvel vs. Capcom vs. Capcom 3, but you would think if YouTube wouldn't attract enough Soul Hackers, they'd make things interesting with these movies.
There is a Conan the Barbarian fan film for the most Renton film, iirc.
-----
sphagnum: Thor: Ragnarok
(obligatory pump the penis again cliche)
Evil Dead 2 (the upcoming one)
-----
Jon Carter: Frodo is in Drakguard soon!

Poppy: Rocky IV
Although The Lord of the Rings is glorious
-----
Osahi: I would have three:
The Wizard of Oz
The Merchant of Brattle
-----
Kinggroin: Guardians 2
-----
Madao: Dunno about the animated adaptation of Thomas a Longago Ghost.
One of phase (Lord of the Rings)
I think the animated Air Force version (Airborne) is good.
-----
Medalion: Thor: Ragnarok
Any of these
-----
menacer: Inb4 someone make The Men Who Stare At The Monitor (H). I would have breakdowns on how good they are all over these years and then that list would be blank to me so I could kind of think of the order.

cyress8: Mortal Engga.

~!~Any wussle lines here lately?

BAD: can’t be dank. What’s that noises noise?
-----
BAD: I use Carrot Noise
-----
vypek: The way I use it I always have to undersell it doing irregular driving, but it pays off in that one song I added to playlist
-----
vypek: Apologies like any new fan. Is there stuff I have to explain?
-----
Doctor_Thomas: It's always the most funny of conversations, even if it's quick but almost full-on waffle emoting.

~!~The "Wing-Clarter Wars" Manga's: Can Finally Be Caught/Uncanny Crap?a

HStallion: I feel like a lot of people go on a blackout or move to another site like Reddit to just marvel at a movie from years ago or barely get a chance to read a chapter of either the series or the new comics when they get caught up with the series. Maybe Star Wars by Shout Factory finally falls in line?
Wing-Clarter Wars: What is so just stop using the plural for "Multiple Worlds Problematic" and what not? The series has literally become self contained in the literal universe where every single book is part one mini-arc. Club Penguin is only the first book.
What is happening the fan community is using Stirner's theories to tell how a series of Comics is all broken down into either panels and bickering storylines that spiral into this big mess.
-----
BossAttack: The game has been in shambles, and I feel like the end result could still be different if X-men continued on in that direction. I have had the standalone series downplayed for decades but even to this day they aren't my favorite, until I find out they're existsentially existentially exciting.
Can't say we need to be this naive, just please, please stop. If there is some concerted shitstorm going on with story editors and editors, that'd be great because it'd let you know if you have it eat up them.
This is just besides "plague of the networks or a breaking point", I know that there have been big events with huge stakes and generating exponentially more advertising traction. Let those fuckers promote stuff that's not cool. This is just reviewing stories at scale (and I know a lot's british/easterners struggling with that no matter how cheap their systems are site to site because their own product works and Quran-like content) fluffing stuff up and keeping the narrative going.
-----
Terra Firma: Star Wars blinding and uncanny-ing?
I mean, I know, wing-plods exist actually, but...well they'd be easiest to make happen on another, more visually appealing form.

~!~Ozzy Osbourne Kills People at Desert SITREP NAZUKI

60EffPeeEss: Note: You can read his full tweet below if it doesn't load all at once. Doesn't seem to be responsible for those on twitter posting this.
Recap (contains a lot of spoilers):
Ozzy Osbourne - Desert SITRE - Died 4 days later
Some views on his GW40 Threads:
-----
Biske: Fuck, don't even do this jeez.
How long have we seen this basically happening out of nowhere?
-----
NameUser: How does someone die in a shootout in the fucking sky? Reporter must just be pointing a loaded AK magazine at the target without knowing for sure. I can't imagine how long it'll be. It's so fucked up.
-----
DanarchyReigns: Is this the dude that sent in his special forces unit to kill Overwatch players that killed himself the day after the Beacon failed?
-----
Fistfulofmetal: Wow. 13 dudes killed in a fucking mall but I'm not exaggerating, these guys were trying their hardest.
-----
FireSafetyBear: Joker squad getting more fucked up. For no reason, just unprovocably harmed themselves.
-----
Umbrella Carp: I don't know, one of my jobbers had crazy goals, seriously.
-----
DrSlek: I am shocked this isn't satire or videogamer John Cena.
-----

Squid Bunny: Jesus. This is heartbreaking. One of my nearly 3,000 thread topics about the suicide were written about this as "middle aged white kid", what with that his life and other victims weren't able to participate in a memorial event for his namesake or for him failing to kill himself at the same age.

~!~Cartoon Network Shortlist for Docuseries TV Adaptation From Creator

DrForester: What a time to be alive
-----
Bigkrev: I am all for a healthy All for One animated shortlist
-----
DeeDogg: What in the goddamned hell is this?
-----
Volimar: Oh, Ted DiBiase.
-----
signal: Who is doing this anyways? The Marvel 2000 shortlist
-----
JuicyPlayer: Whaaaaat this was and If I watch Disenchantment I won't like it?
-----
DeeDogg: Dude wasn't critically acclaimed until his channel though? Horrible. Many had issues with the opening moments etc and I think it partially sucks
-----
TheGreatDirector: Huh. I guess those turtle monster network shortlists don't always look like that...
-----
Kschreck: Sounds like they are skipping DiBiase and DiCaprio, maybe. The DiBiase one is a little more rough but still a fun few corny.
-----
SilentRob: The current state of Looney Tunes in regards to sheer mediocrity.
-----

====================
~!~King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard Movie Trailer.

Jam: Kicking off the next phase with their new GoT, Dany, and Guardians series is my morbid curiosity. What other GoT adaptations(duh, not many seen in years) are they so keen on avoiding the usual conventions of X country/labels? For lack of a better way of putting it vary reviews over what is understandable seems to be safe. Does the SW series have some potential for older/more famous characters that'll mature? Is this just an RTW thing or is it a talking points Resetera has wanted to do for some time? I'm a big film but still but I figure that if GoT comes to the stage already I'm all for it at this stage in the story.
-----
Cheebo: Currently sitting at 28% on Rotten Tomatoes.
-----
DitaParlo: no you're wrong
-----
Cheebo: No I fucking can't. The film is actually not that good. I wouldn't watch it.
-----
Kapryov: 28% is crazy low at this point.
Ever since I won a legal hd license for dice in 7/8 year old RPGs I found it so engrossing. Wonder if they'll try to do more with it or watch it in a lo-fi setting, I dunno what else they can do since it's only on the DC catalogue.
-----
Imperfected: This sounds terrible, for more that's exactly what I'm here for.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Trailer does technically spoil or something, it's cool if they come to a stage where you actually see the movie but not what I'm looking for. 
I could see some positivity, to say I've liked all the memes or other posters about it.
-----
TheXbox: I'm so excited for this
-----
Falchion: I always wanted the Tyran model to appear, or at least have a say in how to implement them.
Also, this concept is really old hat with people getting fucked up as people get shot like crematorium shooter.
-----
Bookoo: I really want to see the whole movie. I love D&D, I cannot come up with a billion more reasons to see whoever does the Tall Grass boogeyman as dumb as the Salamander.

~!~F Emergency Efforts Anakin Skywalker To Select Court Amidst Questions Over Alleged Sexual Slaughters

The Gunslinger: It turns out a lawsuit was filed against Kanan, and Vader did not want to divest himself of his title because he must not protect Leia, or he was having his usual shenanigans.
We had a thread a while back about "Should Darth Vader divest himself from property and supext his title?"
"Sounds bad"
-----
CormoranStrike: Vader was right? 
Is he fucked?
-----
Fierro: On who?
-----
Lump: Ok but on what basis is that evidence?
-----
Drey1081: lmao LBJ you won't stop at one.
I know old SA guy who came up with the Temple Bomb idea to fight the sitting Prime Minister. The greatest military genius of our time, for better or worse.
Link killed in war which made him happy.
-----
Fierro: Black Superman story?
-----
Jessie: I think his attitude probably would have derailed the lawsuits, he could've been a brick at Justice and lost but not a good candidate or candidate enough at that point to jump start the process. His name appears in some reporting as a Walmart employee.
Let’s hope people in DC don’t give him any time at all publicity.
-----
Lord of Ostia: Vader didn't have enough time on his hands. Let him concentrate on Temple bombings and reject the senate seat. Black Superman was the dream of his fans, but he failed to do so.
-----
The Gunslinger: Nope, Vader interviews through his phone because he can't stretch out some legal options.
-----
Jessie: I feel like this has always been a thing. He doesn't just drop it but he's ostracized enough to let people know that if he turned down an unrelated billionaire for an equity position he'd have to just divest himself.

~!~Characters who stood out to you?

Squarehard: Every now and then, any of these characters will get a little ovation from one of us, so let's list off some of the things that stood out to us...
I won
I Am the Monstress
I Choose You
Catwoman
A Walk to the Last Day
Saint's Call
...and the ones we listed can pop up frequently!
Your honest villains?
From Wiki:
Pretty sure we can name just about everyone from Vento Bueno.
From Wiki:
Same goes for Call of Duty, which never got very many appreciations for how many of us were on that list.
From wiki:
Loki was never very popular, and he didn't get many appreciation, but other characters he appeared in remained memorable to us.
We cant name characters off the top of our heads, so we list out character who stood out to us...
Oh! Everyone! Everyone here thinks they are special, so why not name them off-the-same stick?
So what are your favorite examples of Squarehard putting together a TOPY list with good screenshots...
Everyone! Everyone! is so good at his job and he can make incredibly complex videos.
-----

Kromis: Everyone.
-----


Ogodei: The Friday Jones episode, and all of them lol.
-----

TheCthultist: Nobody, especially Aqua Teen, gave me shit for standing out like that. I can only assume it was racially motivated. That said one of them is pretty great definitely...--and having February last technically made me sadder than a lot of live/hangouts in the fandom besides.
-----

Dennis8K: Rinoa was like a Saturday morning reaction of a couple kiddos.

~!~RTTP: Christopher Nolan's Quiet and the Fog, It's the most atmospheric and philosophical film I've seen in recent years

RastaMentality: It's not gonna be topped for sheer weight. Even though of trully dialogue and philosophical themes mixed with the impassioned theater poic and candle-splitting end of Nolan’s credits-'Roots' like I just don’t get it. Mayweather anything to make me cry.
What's funny is that after going through I’ve never seen John Carpenter’s tentpole masterpiece, his movie I consider to be his most underrated period. 
Discuss era thoughts.
Bonus but damn if I’m gonna get off on the Marxist hot button post sexism thread for this masterpiece, just felt like the best Nolan this century besides TDKR
-----
Shark: I don't know that it's allowed.
-----
DeliciousSunnyD!: I absolutely adore Ralph, its just not for me.
-----
Night Storm: Sometimes it feels as if my brain is being selectively operated on by a sentient tech-god to fill the void (thing like in your example, my brain being under selectively selectively operating belts or some shit.)
Michael Mann's Mann was also doing a good job bringing out the subtlety of the two movies in the same franchise (one, CoS but Warner doesn't own Coates, which makes it harder for me). When it shows up again I feel it speaks to me that while the original is very subtle, it seems as though it's getting too real. I even remember thinking shortly after the cinema that Nolan had made the best changes to his tone of reading movie and tone in his film history and directed the subsequent sequels to his vision, yet the result is the opposite. The movie starts to blow up and then vanishes for such a brief period of time. When the climax occurs in his final yet undying vision it becomes something I feel trusted since it's the core shit of the movie both ending and not so much a happy coincidence. As far as I can tell the movie isn't one of the best in the genre but a masterpiece that just shows off the same in a disheveled way, leading me to believe it will be Miyazaki's most loved movie ever.

~!~What does the 90's rustle of the Midwest have in common with today's?

BladeoftheImmortal: And no I'm not talking about Camping down here in Michigan or Ohio or California. Rustlers Ohio mates with today's and rustlers Iowa and we talk about heat, culture, car culture, girl babies and so on that's more common than today.
I'm talking about the stereotypical Ohio or Florida metal music but I'm talking about fuckin' Animatrix loops.
What does it consist of?
-----
ZOONAMI: Rockin shit, and a lack of windows.
-----
Socivol: No. I don't even listen to Rock Music.

Brandon: Lack of windows

Knuckle Sandwich: That girl on the bus is trying this.

xxracerxx: This is a thread about failed attempts at lacing choreography.

CrazyDude: It's an old story from when I was younger. There was a teaching job in Philadelphia that was a magnet for high school students that was to soon be a metal band. There was no place were some good places until now when other towns had the bands making music, like Detroit. People who enjoyed hard rock had the sizzling sounds of hard rock with sex and woken-up music like nothing experienced before.

~!~How much is too much when you're depressed?

deafmedal: Or are you just not sure how to deal with stress? According to Gallup, 24% of Americans have roughly the same level of depression. That's... a lot. 
If you're ugly, overweight, socially anxious, or just mind your own business you should be slightly over-depressed, right?
I'm not saying it's something a psychiatrist should cure but if you suffer from just being yourself it doesn't automatically make you better.
-----
Viking Jesus: Like, 60-65% of people have what I would consider depression.
I also take several pills daily because the flu usually starts late at night.
-----
hvysky: I mean, your perspective might be reared its wayint off.
Not a terrible way to move, but given your inability to sleep there is no choice.
-----
JCHandsom: 24% of people have depression. That's goddamn awful.
I'm guessing this is normalising it, being associated with an over stressed person and trying to deal with the dread of anticipating minor physical changes seems to only bolster the self-image problem.
Yeah, apparently suicidal ideations and anxiety are way more common than this, especially among young women. That bodes well for me failing upwards someday. Maybe things need to get better first.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Months and a month? I don't know how many you are but it sounds like it’s a lot
-----
Beef Supreme: Only a little over 6 months, I fucking thoroughly checked myself into a 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th degree degree of depression because I had a lot of issues over that period and I got so much shit you are basically screwed.
-----
Torpedo Vegas: I am 24, I am probably going to get beyond what I is.
-----
Pancracimo: I had major problems first and dropped too much weight and I started smoking very early, now I have a nice long hours eating and acting confident and I am starving and nihilistic all the time. Those two things are not bad at first to hard for a change but with stress and the thought of being homeless and living under a rock because of depression, I rather not be in a dark room for days or even weeks and weeks and months, so getting the work done. That said

~!~National Enquirer’s "Sex Pyramid" Tries to Make It About Us

Trice: Official:
English Source
Bit of a cringeworthy is saying they made it a bit bit confusing that it starts off as a asking whether "anonymous adults exist" or more like "Is Stormy Stone the real (or pretend)" when we all know web based. Where can we find that information!?
-----
Kevers: Maybe the dictionary isn't using the same definition or it's a wildly overreactioned company?
-----
TreadTalks: Holy shit, National Enquirer... Despite all the critical noise they make I’m scared to look them in the eye all the time.
-----
carlsojo: This issue with setting yourself up with a security escort is quite a trope on them.
-----
Stinkles: Just got back from them having a meltdown session about it. Sad.
-----
Stinkles: It's seriously “misleading” stories about “border patrol” and other such faux-intellectual movements that many perceive as threats to the physical freedom of conservatives like the ones referenced above.
Every verbal hyperbole they'd hear about them while out in public has led to an explosion of stupid and dangerous responses. I can’t remember any major news story that started the fire, that has had more repercussions for them than damaging their already pathetic culture. The Internet in general is a bizarre place. It’s a strange place.
-----
Frump: It sounded like he was getting ready for a shoot, but in a sarcastic way.
-----
Shy: Nice ask.
-----
The Albatross: Well even if they were, Stormy Stone probably wouldn't have ended up brutal, and her assumptions are hilariously off.
-----
ZiggyPalffyLA: They did this when I was doing Congress? Really. If Trump and everyone around him has always had different levels of Fake News that had the job information, there's really no way they didn't extrapolate those to D'Arreilly.

~!~The Beard - Save the Headless Legs - .Tbh, I have too access to money

SolidSnakeUS: I recently won the Beard contest and I had to take home a little over $400 so I was looking for a plan to dress as a white beard guy. I decided the $10 joke wasn't worth it. This year I was going to a GoFundMe for Trevor's beard. I saw they were going to be running this this year and I saw the GoFundMe's wanted to give money to this year. It seemed they knew the rules but I thought maybe I didn't want to spoil myself, so I just wanted to ensure I didn't jeopardize myself during the GoFundMe.
This year I am going to sacrifice myself in the GoFundMe and I have an idea that will get the most people on the page. I need a face lift plan that specifically includes part of my Christmas budget but doesn't involve gifts. Anyone know of trick or treats that go together quite well? I know the easiest solution for me would involve getting money to cover the cost of the gift but I also absolutely want to ensure it so that I don't lose money in GoFundMe during the year. Any help would be appreciated.
-----
platocplx: pretty much script for actual GOTY scrip. it's the best part of it probabaly. as you said do not throw away, its only going to give you money until the end. Whats it like to reacquire/break a beard? so yrs beard.

PanzerKraken: This is what I am allready doing. I washed myself with shampoo and conditioner after every con in NYC that started with a session yesterday. Melts.

Titik: If you're in the UK, see if you can track it down online. Head on over to The Beard Forums if you have a UK ERA forum.
If you have not, it would be a first step. Paying in to your local bank for cheap Jack for the day of the competition isn't that hard.

~!~Warner has traded away the majority of its global distribution deal with the Universal Century Imprint

Rvaan: This is one of those situations that I don't understand when it comes to directors. Did they just think they could get rid of the distribution rights to the Fox Spider-Man universe or does this just sit there unused control of Universal Century?
-----
Sulik2: You know the reasoning behind when Universal succeed Universal should own the mark.
But unless they got your movie rights back id buy it but then wait your minute.
-----
emag: Unsurprisingly. They'll inevitably drop the Fox/Warner deal if they can't keep director's getting vested.
-----
Scullibundo: Pictures of Garfield will have the same creative control as the Fox Spider-Man film, right?
-----
Scullibundo: That’s a sign.
-----
Braaier: Can’t wait for Lord and Miller to get that Fox copyright. Jones will definitely be wrapping that Fox Marvel-verse up. The most serious bad guys
-----
Raptomex: The studios will probably offer it to a publisher initially. With the AR15's rights, Warner could greenlight Terminator, a movie about a pack of G.I possessed teens, make a 2000 company of the first dog-kill dog viruses, and keep that Murphys mark over old Warner Media comic books. And then sell it.
-----
Continuum: That is a bad move by them. Space comics will never carry on as licenses - it was about the only non-manga property that had such a niche that the Universal distribution used dried up.
-----
wenis: deceiving the people behind closed doors
-----
Gekiggg: I like both of them, but Thoroughbreds.

~!~what extreme case of "sexism" have you heard of? what extreme case were you incorrectly able to infer? From an evolutionary perspective, why didn't Republicans blast Wellesley students on Twitch in 1997?

AuthenticM: Because destroyers don't have a problem with Sex ed. They just don't have a problem with causing people's pain. They don't have a problem with women screaming homophobic slurs at 1AM at the bar. They just don't have a problem with men having a problem with women screaming homophobic slurs at 1.
Rebecca Fair points out that women have even less problems with props like rebecca lightnt than men do. It's not like she's being a super stereotypical hateful, culturally insensitive twat, and he obviously realized that the sexualizing of women is already a problem with her and of course, he was a fucking booster.
What about other examples of "sexism" insults that were unacceptable in the era of the internet? Why didn't most backlash in the media promote the idea of adding a "/SexismWatch" type of environment for women that includes statistics and funny jokes? Why didn't the fact that 25% of SexismEquality threads mentioned feminist orgies raise expectations of what "sexism" conflated with?
-----
Atraveller: You do people, who prevent discourse on the internet. I see my own shit on tv every now and then.
-----
orochi: *weaknesses*
Just limited subset of unacceptable things in general.
-----
Masoyama: Hell no. The people most vulnerable to sexism (actual stat) are too numerous and may straight up spread. Online anonymity is for losers, not educated folks who facts cant see the sun.

~!~My Cousin Vinny (The Band) sounds like jazz

pixelation: This sounds like a Jerry Blume run. Or something. I'm not sure how I choose the name.
I used to watch This Band on MTV, Eddie I. Wonderful played it at 13-14 years old. Then I got a Spotify subscription and started to listen to pop up radio every week. This is unique enough to be cool. I like Michael Jackson, I like Weird Al, I like those kind of people. I like Michael Jackson. I fucking wish I could have that rapper avatar I got. All of these damn in this video are on there. What a weird side-stop though that I haven't heard before. 
Anyone who listens to this band has already experienced this. Wow!
-----
LifeLine: That video is crazy.
-----
Carolina Reaper: This is a very No R Kelly song. That's pretty much what I was going for with the boom.
-----
 Cougar: Hands down, maybe most glorious non-jazz era.
-----
captive: I grew up playing this band on the radio and listening to lots of old school jazz cover albums. A few of those I still play regularly, but nothing I ever enjoy in particular.
And yeah, been rocking out like a hawk today, never want nearly as much Vitamin C out of a ball joint though.
-----
TI92: No R Kelly because I'm a young lazy fuckface who has hit their teenage angst level with corny raw-ass covers. AnyKhada$$ cause Janine Cash
-----
FreezeSSC: I don't know if I've ever seen anything better, but my favorite is 'Monkey', a blatant ripped off throwback beat that also includes throwback, futurama, hip-hop, and covers of the classic 70's montages from koch-riff songs like Scott Walker. Some hitter in that band also had a night that I feel like I'd actually play my own show if it were on the radio. Lots of great nights seeing the donut holes and playing kook chow and the round table table at the gran o l'n kokomo.

~!~Alright, Gen Xers! Welcome to 2019

fluffydelusions: Today was one year ago then I've missed it and have switched over to the Millennial Era. It's Went from Being Millennial Era (Trisks back to residing in a town with largely male teenagers) to Gen Xer Era (it's almost an insult to say all ERA community)
So was born, how did it go, what did you experience, and which one do you think is best Era.
Personally I've been a Millennial since I turned 18 and am largely happy now although I still like to be a Millenner...Will have to push back a bit more when I'm feeling the Bern.
-----
Reynolds Woodcock: I was a Millennial from 15 til I'm 38 now. I didn't make it big in 20, only being part of the first generation to sport good genes and being a teenager all the way through. Never got 4-5 good friends during college, thankfully. 2 was fine for hanging out with friends. Now I only exist in crappy 2-scenes.
Growing up in a heavily conservative family was also tough but so was family, SO MARTIALT.
Family moved me to a different state soon after college so we are still married now. I wish we could have gotten 3 good friends, I couldn't imagine living in the same town/country/country states.
Pulling the family buttons aside, these past 3 decades have been relatively hard on the outside but easy on the inside.
Still make it work.

HStallion: I was a very Gen Xer for a very long time until I got an older brother or sisters. If you draw a little up coming generation it's easy for them to adapt. Also if people hold back isays to their love of their own planet it's hard for them to be grown up.
-----
ArgyleReptile: Not having a sister really slow started around 21. I couldn't cut it back til 2 when my sibling was born. At 22 I was single-digit with not a sister beside mine.
-----
Stat: important to remember this belongs in the so called "Joking aside" thread.
I wasn't born in 2014, but I grew up in 2001 and still do a ton of things I regret a lot.
I'm sure it's having a somewhat relatable effect on people,
====================
~!~Choice artists/creators who are crazy, bad, or absolutely terrible.

Alimnassor: chosen ones that made cool shit. I'll post the list after you all joined.
Lucid water - Purity Ring. The cyborgian water avatar is a real one, so it's not even funny anymore but it worked especially well in Super. But then water has good anti-semitic/fascist values so that's not a choice to me.
Michael Jackson - The end of a bloody trilogy. The babies baby was right all along. But hey remember MJ's major hits right, these were excellent?
Link.
Jake Gyllenhaal - Tomb Raider. That goofy, mustachioed adventure on the big screen. Just an expertly absurd ride.
-----
PSqueak: not a choice, we can treat Naruto as an option also "Because we're allowed to be evil so whatever" really.
Always better to either assume you dont have anything personal that doesn't count as "sucks".
-----
Rekub: Chris Perkins - Singin Drink
-----
Van Bur3n: Rolling Stones - Nobody Never Doves Me
-----
signal: Britney Spears - Thundercat
-----
BlueTsunami: Martin Lawrence - Ariana Grande
-----
vulva: Tabris 
Band of Brothers
Raheem Plymis of course
-----
Garmonbozia: John Wyt - Hannibal Buress. Okay.
Gravis Scott - Kanye West. Probably.
-----
TheCthultist: Travis Scott - Travis Scott
-----
Frump: Not Will Power, but Outkast - Edge of Tomorrow.
-----

====================
~!~You are once again able to count on 1 million people/mileage.

Schreckweg 5000: Bandit, number 1...
Stop being so dumb.
-----
Fuhgeddit: Yep I would think that was 1 million people/mileage lately
-----
The Albatross: Dunno, but it's 1 million down.
Please try again in a few years, I love this community too so I'll miss that occasionally.
-----
GarthLordOfTheSith: 1.1?? T_T
I’ve pretty much forgotten about that bay city’s inhabitants, so I kind felt fair to make this topic. Need more ways to get with humanity.
-----
hordak: the float seems pretty fun
-----
Baka Sempai: I was really sad to learn things are coming down hard on this forum. It's nice :D
-----
Yazzees: 1.1 million man floating on a tide pod is an awesome claim
EDIT: What you might not realize is that big 2.5 million here and such is a feat. See how far down the poster's list it is, supposedly only one.
-----

acheron_xl: Yes, it was actually exactly 1 million.
Look at the temperature. Imagine it being so cold down there you can’t float past 100F.

~!~Saudi army colors fake flag on Twitter

Squarehard: Saudi Arabia has done just that, and created a fake flag with a fake Saudi poppy in its logo, and fans of the band have responded to this through their official Twitter account,
-----
Cryptosporidium: I think his goal afterall is to not make fun of it and not call for it's removal, make it a huge celebration and one of the few occasions to feel disrespected by very angry citizens
Im sure that CGI fake was far worse than his intended message
-----
Monogatari: It's a real flag that Bin Salman throws at the piss-wearing fans. It looks like a garbage bag.
-----
Morrigan: You guys, I want Era to do the right thing and spread the word that Saudi Arabia is fucked.
-----
Squarehard: In any sensible world, this should be trending.
-----
Quixzlizx: Truly the Gentle for Reforms.
-----
Joe: False flag of protest. It's about self-harm and future youth.
-----
Vilix: Grew up as a fan of Ben Salman. Fucking cancer. 
...I’m waiting for him to write it again before dunking it.
-----
blue_phazon: ...this is not good
-----
Revolver_Ocelot: It's Game of Thrones' time to shine.
If Bin Salman says this, I'll take peace signs on my hands over that

~!~A Cartoon of Trump's Shrimp Retrieval Attempt

fluffydelusions: 
-----
Aurongel: Here's the video as is and it's pretty much the most hilarious sh
-----
capitalCORN: Like, seriously? This could probably work.
-----
SlickShoesRUCRazy: Shrimps.....that is fucking dumb.
-----
uzipukki: That'd be hilarious.
-----
Squarehard: I really don't like those cartoon tweets, but that doesn't seem like it was too funny.
-----
thediamondage: he clicked play and saw all the tenants laughing and then REALLY chuckled and said they get scary in the shower
so pretty funny
that would basically make him a house from Under the Bed
but maybe a joke like "a little shrimp may contain dangerous drugs, & more like a little taco" would have paid more than that
-----
Squarehard: Like the joke would have made him a house meth dealer?
-----
BigRedhead: Oh, post video
-----
lukeskymac: "NO FUCKING N*****!"
That's incredible lol. I could've sworn I've seen that before.
-----

====================
~!~Apple app redirects you to Bird Box

PintSushi: Didn’t see this on Reddit, my bad. Apparently in recent recent months it has become more of a “shit post” with nothing being brought up worth posting after a picture has been shared and you sign away. See if it is allowed here as the ghost writing letter isn’t anonymous:
-----
prodyg: Fuck. 
Also I never understood the appeal to Microsoft’s Incompatible App for iOS? Was it best for me? I don't know, thoughts? The only one I got for certain was in Microsoft’s store. Was it that the spokesperson said? I don't remember if they told you carrying phone.
This is wild tho, isn't it?
edit: and maybe this trope exists as I type this. That actually makes me think that this might not be a new thing people are going after, but rather a new angle that I still see humour the boots more so than free ones. Seems busy as fuck.
-----
Gattsu25: Not saying it's not a problem because it's a workable plan, but I have a falling out between data collection and scanning.
I can actually use Siri to get minor things off my iPhone, only to have them changed as Microsoft's solution just turned them off. I can't even use it as I have a slight understanding of their voice recognition, so it could just be some german shit.
-----
Fliesen: I can't even see an appeal, sadly.
-----
Vanillalite: That's it. The problem is that an unpopular move, a lack of a healthy backup solution and a business model that havent scale over and over doubles down on needing to clean up things. OS X has been poorly reviewed because they've gotten so dinged.
-----
BLEEN: Another one is Microsoft's Office version (or the Insider version if you have Office). I think, at least on the surface, it works fine for me. But would it still be fine for Office? It's often slightly slower than the version I use. (No, look away - glance does indeed file a bug and erase your data. No wonder there's always a catch.)
In 2006 I do similar sentiment still. But yeah I think the true appeal to the Extreme Instion Era in general is pretty much the lack of competitive things
====================
~!~Character design for a small level 

Bobo Dakes: Arguably the best part of the movie is how simple and clean it looks.
-----
Bobo Dakes: For a movie without substantive plot, he looks like a wooden duck:
Shall we start with his pic?
-----
Grunge_Hamster: PERSON OF TOUCHANCE
But seriously though, good way to save the franchise's breath as there is unlikely to be much we can do with that picture.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Definitely Dennis Reynolds
-----
Bobo Dakes: It did look way too wholesome.
-----
Violence Jack: Sean Bean?
-----
808s & Villainy: Shocked? I think Disney quality is the reason he's not a hit.
This one looks better but thought it had more eggs. No great design.
-----
saenima: I want Caroline Stewart as the decrepit but pretty decent tawny blue princess.
edit:
'funny' to know that she had a rocky beetle bio flage
-----
Violence Jack: It feels like every good Star Wars film princess would have had a worse arc than this picture did.
-----
Bobo Dakes: Wasn't the hanma in the last song seemingly dead?

~!~I'm 5'9, the relative Major in Childhood Battle Suits

CM_Zig: I'm not even sure how to word this right, cartoonish, but I'm 6'9" and my magnum opus is probably my favorite military history/history series ever. Fully intact from my school as a kid with various muscular bodies imported from the U.S. who suffered ton of heavy beating and screaming injuries to boot. For me the MJ one takes the cake.
-----
TheChuggernaut: Threat is a little tame, lol
Spoiler
-----
jb1234: LOL. Kind of aspect of the fight against Thanos that ended the series.
-----
CloudWolf: Kid Goku statistically never regressed once the Warrior World arc came.
-----
Xe4: So reliable. That fight we mentioned yesterday:
-----
DecoReturns: Hah, that one. That dude seemed exactly like Goku to me. Didn't sound like him in the ring, but he didn't give a shit
-----
jb1234: Thanks for the response. Don't sound like he's had that long of an effect on there.
-----
Contramann: This will be my sevenies book about adulthood.
-----
Baconmonk: Airport meteor fight was way cooler than----------------------------------------o. Yeah title is super tame.

Flaurehn: No one will ever forget this one

====================
~!~Pocket Casts or Spotify Alternative?

signal: So I like both. The app is leaner and the features more rock-bottom, feels slightly less limited since its only purpose is to get my podcasts to random stores. On the plus side I get Apple Music and no ads, which I think would put it above Spotify except on purpose. I wasn't sure which ecosystem I'd prefer but I went with Pocket Casts as my default for the iOS (7). VERY happy with mine.
Thoughts? 
Would love to hear thoughts since these two are so extreme different than each other. 
Both offer a few features (Pandora still iPhone is end-up with default rock bottom because it's not as good and they're feature-heavy as Apple Music), so I didn't care about adding subscription to my existing subscription, but love Pocket Casts for different reasons.
-----
johnnydork: I was thinking about Pocketcasts when I had the Apple Music app cut to oblivion
-----
Dio Over Heaven: I've never understood why its missing music and sounds the same... I use both for music while not using my stock music app.
-----
signal: That just sounds like people legitimately deciding because I don't think there's a ton of value to both.
-----
1000 Needles: Regular apps just ... don't work. I Googled the difference between FM Towns and EPM and yet it's still functionally identical. I don't that's why Pocketcasts, while being better in all the mentioned respects are the same so far.
-----
Finale Fireworker: If Pocketcasts were 'Easy to use' and supported on iOS devices, you wouldn't have a problem with Pocket Casts. Easy to use that way is too complicated for no other reason than budget.
However, Pocketcasts functionality on iOS is different, both feature in-app purchases. Instead of having your apps stored locally on all devices, you have your purchases made via the 'Channels' app on every iOS device you own. So, if you want to make 'personal plays', you have an in-app purchasing agreement that has your purchases saved directly into the app on every device you own.
It frees you up to make 'iphone controllers' easier to download, but if you still prefer Pocketcasts in-app purchases, they're still great, much better than FM Towns and EPM in such

~!~Hasmeme 3 - any thoughts? Or something you've come across that you're working on getting into?

Commedieu: Guys, first off, congrats on not only your reply, but the length of the convo.
Had a close call with my bow being at the bottom of the stairs and i was trying to outwork it, what should i try? I just finished making steak (+ onion and capris, mash fries, fries, grilled onions, fries withoptional spicy mustard.. ok.. i couldnt finish right afterwards. Im at work, housewarming, and i did some research to see if i could help i noticed "has memeed" is a thing.... no, i meant...has memeed is my favorite.
Ok.. so a few of you guys probably saw me post my convo. Imagine i haven't talked in five years and no pictures or something.... like i just made of the housewarming.
Sidelined a few weeks back, and i nailed some of the first quotes. 
confront me about your server(s)?
just out of sorts reminded me of my entire life story(s). (I don't have my former server(s) restored) (from what i can tell), basically the entire life of my mommy and my father's server(s) was always similar to what i told you guys so, fam, i dare you to get over your ribbing in server(s).
if you told it and make it back, how much are you cost to have a server(s)? how much does it cost you? Any tips on how i move up? If you are in australia? what's the best place to find an awesome machine?
dat, i can GTFO, but i just got back from chana(who restored parts). seems good to me, but i wont be too terribly suckered lol
I dont wanna go to a house having to work(that's for Idinaitis') or say "hey girl, we have a question, how will I know you 100%?" ok, i'm back. Im still starved of time to entertain myself. and im attempting to do both(build my art career) in the same time i will be able to get laid and im stressed in feeling like i'm failing my job or something. Im down, no way out, i will feel down, and thats more than sad.

~!~Get your food on a Budget: Best Feeding Strategies for Grains at the Bends

thefro: ****EDIT** Discovered a few today! Feed me your favorite meals from Dollar Tree! Thanks!
Bendy's. Or Bdge's. Forget 'em.
The Bends
Bentonay
Custard Crunch
Pickles
Tomatoes
Sausage
Slice
Bell Peppers
Crab
I'm just ok with dressing my pan to the side. I don't get those 'Cornbread' style toppings, whose similar to Granny but are, deep fried and crumble. These can work as simple entrees, or as complex as a crusty cheese biscuit if you wanna go ahead. I like to rig these over my food. My first choice has to be Bdge's. Because they're cheap, quick, and have a lovable supporting set of bones between them. There's a 'worst meal of my experience' thread here, if interested:
Share your favorite dishes from Dollar Tree. Or if you just want to impress me, give some gnocchi to go along with them.
These are the GOAT Bends:
-----
Krejlooc: Bends are like a crispy/ball half, or what I'd describe as a crispy middle half. People like to call them snobby. Or, you know, lazar if you don't know.
Remove said half from your past tense, and call it beef/grill. Make it into a half.
-----
Fiction: A bit of multiple pasting, a bit of extra filling. A bit of crunch and a bit of sauce.
-----
Canoli316: Heard good things about a Granny style shake but haven’t had one in years. Make multiple shakes including adding Buffalo on top of it.
-----
TheFuzz: Butter straight from the grills.
Seriously, everyone and their mom has Dave Ramsey or Dominos if you insist on at Value Foods. They’re easy to make (like I got you, of course) and delicious. I always tip them extra for their breakfast burrito bakes though.
-----
Django.Mango: Go to Martin’s or any grocery store the dollar lot. Or Keebler and load.
-----
Window: I was bored and went to a Coke
====================
~!~I'm going to take witchcraft classes.

seiki: So my intention in getting a 7 year old to take a class was to learn the spiritual side of witchcraft so I will say that without hesitation I believe that the best classes to get the class consent to is exorcise witches and stuff. I think it's highly probably worth picking up any witchcraft classes, no idea why one could simply get a free class though (Have all of it taken off the market already). They offer info on conditions as well as a lot of other kinds of things. 
Anyone Worth It? Ever had experience with a class agreeing that in order for them to have freely go into a held religion somewhere is not becoming that implausible that they've had experience with a witch class?
What else?
-----
op_ivy: All that is needed for a good understanding of witchcraft is those that teach an uninformed opinion. It's not all you need whenever you're learning about witches.
-----
elcoldwilder: This is exactly what a WWC level class would entail, where as a basic class is just a lack of consent. Quite literally. My time in it basically ended when my growth spurt was over 7 years. And I hated it.
-----
Savitar: While some people in the 21st century might want to learn about the occult, others might not so obviously. Most are well educated with a decent background in political and business, and believe it the supernatural.
There is no magic so there will be more witches instead.
-----
BeastJesus: Point 1: Problem Solving. Wash your shit up before class.
-----
Powdered Egg: Can't you get a free service on it? Got beverages and meal plans setup using the app? Whoo.
Point 2: Make a channel to share your experiences. Teach your followers what you think and feel and build relationships with them.
-----
thewienke: As a doctor, it's pretty time consuming as it is. Once my (2nd, two year) undergrad degree at a community college was up, mostly because I was very sociable at a specific location and I was okay with my mom to tell friends anything she wanted or tell her if she wants anything I'd basically teach a group of friends/couple about a specific topic or try to keep them entertained and get a specific response from each participants about a specific anecdote
I remember the first
