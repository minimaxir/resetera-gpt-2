~!~Your Favorite Installer

LionPride: I love using emulators as my OS. I'm not talking about Minecraft or Fortnite I'm talking about every release of an OS from 2008 era. (update: too late!!!)
Maybe it'd be an interesting fit for me just for this thread I'm curious about, and maybe other posters maybe want look at the popular options out there?
Honestly I wanted CERN and work from the heavens for their NICU NICU app.
So into the last couple years of Microsoft I've been thinking of building my own project for cloud audio.Seriously See this:
A lot of other codecs and engineers in tech either like Microsoft Open D FX and Servro NAS but different things as far as I can tell those are Neantrack Common Audio Compressed Digital Audio Frame which supposedly fixes loss of audio with slight digital jitter compared to a window DG project.
Mind you I do want my family 4k and having a high quality oak linux sound channel is probably not for some. 
a prime example of what i like is MBAM.
Edit: Akkma or Audacity are the two I'd recommend.
-----
Droidian: DaVinci Audio, pro/demos.

Cochese: My drywall is about a 1/4 of a foot thick, and I'm currently polishing it up. Was thinking about the Vizio Moisture-Free Drapes (which I really do miss) but I don't know if they have this option or not. I have a large window so this is a huge loss.

Brandon: Saliva dries better then drywall when the drywall itself is already built?

Cochese: Saliva still gets all the benefits if it's living in direct sunlight.

Somnid: Heat pump? Drywall is already built.
Cheap heat drains heat efficiently, welders prefer to weld than tend to heatsink.

Dook's Revenge: No, heatpumps are superior, or whatever if there's even a hint of insulation.
Wool instead, is it Karger's construction rules? The way they get you to just tan your shit on the outside laminate or just an overcoat it in.
The importance of insulation first, as it tends to resist the heat of direct sunlight.

-COOLIO-: but change the heat pump between high and low.
but change both levels too and you get less heat.

Why not use a pressure water heat pump yourself?

~!~Toy Story 4: Bo Peep appreciation thread

bsigg: Hey everyone!
This is Bo Peep finally an approved movie and brought back to Pixar for their 4th film. He's a late 2000s miracle that even the cultists loved it and didn't vote for him, as there's no way this will be another gay erotic fantasy movie.
The time my favorite Disney hero depicted in the story won't arrive before 2033 but here's a more realistic description:
But who are the roles to play in the new Pixar movie? "Men in Black" can do it! My favorite, "Cinderella-esque" doesn't really fit since he's a Maltese Captain! that I can outright dislike!
I don't like the kid for any obvious reasons but holding great contempt for adult Bo Peep is a positive post!
Pose is funny, innovative, and a delight

~!~New Heather Morenham Album "I Sorry I Have to Take Your Life"

Wulfric: Heather is finally releasing a new album. It is absolutely wonderful from beginning to end. It will most likely contain some tracks. It will be released through vaporwave. I'm not a huge fan of the distorted, distorted riffs of live/interpol-style electronic stuff, so I'm excited!
Here are the songs; 
In studio, the musicians follow their own soundtracks of various kinds, so they end up creating strange, melodic 3-or-any-way vocal experiments that go from broken piano bars to chaotic jungle riffs. Hopefully, this will be the end, but the samples and riffs aren't harsh enough to set folks off. Melodic stuff is fine.
Vocal experiments are mostly decent, so unfortunately I won't be buying this this fall? (Here's hoping they include some variety; the sky's the limit for subjective experimentation.)
More nuggets from the album;
---
"I Paused After Knowing That I'm Blacklisted For Helping An Open Bank" is what all the do when we're left at the mercy of corrupt bank employee (Trojita) (misunderstood that).
"The Social Network" is a great, concise, and somewhat badass take on "screaming psychotron", aside from the lack of horns.
"So Far I Won Still Be a Werewolf" has a very beautiful display of Snyder/Leonberg funk:
---
For decent btw, "The Evil Dead" offers many experimental versions of Lovecraftian themes:
(per Wikipedia: The entirety of the bar's soundtrack is available to listen to on YouTube).
Some results:
On here, some specific tracks:
---
"The Lost World" is a vertically-platty mess, one where the lines make an appearances--
"American Dream" is more of a varied array of scenes manifested
"The First Purge" has this beautiful cascade of theatrical protest; "The Stand Off" uses demonic imagery 
"The Graveyard Book" is a lot less trippyy
---------
Heartbreaking, from the perspective of a middle class white male; "For Good" with Kanye West is a poor-at-worst for the irredeemable. "A Heart of Ice" kicks its rave-goer emotions off amazingly well.

~!~Internet has killed my laptop for the easy to circumventing DRM program

Meffer: Internet has been around for a long time and I don’t remember what it was like to be 90 years old. I had an older computer with mainly compusoul and windows. When I had to pay a cable to use the internet I used to use Google for free. Later I paid for an internet access card, and I pay for internet.me which has made the difference of bypassing a whole lot more difficult since I don’t know whether I can still get content without a DRM. I had this problem on my old Asus ACV 3000 and the other problem on my new Acer Aspire v5.
I didn’t know yet that without a DRM, it wouldn’t work with modern PCs. I would have to spend some time figuring out exactly how to circumvent the DRM program since supposedly it would ask for your credit card info when you sign up. This was especially annoying despite otherwise not allowing me to do certain things like downloading ResetEra 2.0 media. For example, I would leave the TV on and then turn it on. I remember this because right at this moment all I saw was begging for the DRM to be disabled, and the ASRAM was 2TB. That said, with just a basic Google search I completely overcame that with a very simplistic setup and didn’t even have to reset the PC’s RAM. 
This was really stupid of my part of the world. I need some methods of circumventing the DRM DRM functionality on amazon,
-----
Intraxidance: I wonder if it was regulators that made this not a factor in the industry as a whole? Like, normal things can now be made harder by companies but DRM programs still have to be embedded in the mainstream and standardized way of doing things like streaming. 
What is the possible alternatives for internet users? You don't have to go do google or vidya or other DRM commands on emacs. It's browser based, but it still requires the hardware.

Now, on a more positive note, the DRM mentality is not as prevalent as it is in your media examples.

~!~Why doesn't the Universal Peace Narrative exist?

Exotoro: One of the biggest problems in human history is that humanity isn't faced with any choice that has minimal or negative benefits (other than war). A peace-based idea is one where eradicating the debt of the world for the sake of just 1 euro (or so) is the way to go.
And if we eradicate the debt of the world simply 1 euro is the way to go. how can we do that? Well, the U.S. has tried this model before, and it doesn't work great but it keeps failing and eventually becoming a false possibility. The reason is, I dunno, it's because the U.S. never intended to try this but it's not a realistic idea.
I've made some observations like maybe NATO was never that effective at changing the situation until the USSR or someone was assassinated. That's one area where the way to is already open(...what the FOA is) but the second thing we'll be covering is the Blame and the EU, if they don't stop *real* wars from happening.

~!~My life is not exactly the most interesting you'll ever be

BAD: Ok time to read about professional in-person conversations. Maybe it's my main reason for going on 42 years as an AT&T unlimited bundle subscriber. It's just my routine. I check appointments, check e-mailings, check matches (gotta keep tabs up on how many old AT&T towers you're subscribed to), and often check our submittal times manually (in order to pick the few fastest matches).
It must be really frustrating. Not me eating breakfast because I'm shilling for health insurance and continuing to lose weight and doing nothing wrong. Not to mention I do things and participate in forums I shouldn't and do all the same things in order to know what's going on in our community and current day? There's been a few people I know who made bad choices which is stupid. I unfortunately can't come up with elaborate reasons for not being interested or bothering with list stuff like that. 
Are there interesting people here? No write ups or people you agree are really interesting?

KojiKnight: Most people I talk to on the internet on a regular basis, GameStop is always a good "side-channel" and they still ship with HD copies of The Witcher 3 every year or so now. Every PS3 sales rep we talk to always wants us to buy them. Which is fine, I think a lot of the larger channels craft more crap than they used to, but it just gets the point across: They produced something new. Anything else simply appears to be "were building your life" look at my eyes when I ship the boxes around their store, so I don't mind either way.
Also I guess I'm just familiar with the internet. Think of the physical blogs there used to be, where the "where are you getting your resources from the site if you aren't keeping everything in mind?" thing. I understand it's not good for your mental health but it still helps

Often in conversation, when talking with family members, it is pointed out it is a schedule issue and you will want to bring an audible to this. Kinda like Nes Titter saying flu is like an irrelevant health issue but something that has been a near constant in tense situation. 
One from a friend is mind blowing: Children dont think they are having fun, but watching a tv show in order to lose your child is of course a distraction.

~!~Putting together practical sketches for a novel/game related project

DJ Lushious: Hello EtcetEra. I'm about to start work on their second novel and perhaps it would be a great start; is anyone's work as a practical point of reference and inspiration? Is anyone's work in any way an inspired creation or attempt to help the creative team "up their game" (as in, what they've fashioned as a full fledged gaming genre took over, but without "for a particular project specifically built around that game" mentality?
Getting specifics down from the way ahead of me and my wife is excited about this project, but I just got ideas from several other folks as a unique level of direction for this project (thanks in no way really allowed). We didn't get anything other than very specific, but as we're going the adventure stuff is fairly high priority for this so far.
Ideally we would like to get a client like:
a big console in the form of a CYOA Steam/Nintendo Switch/PSX emulator within maybe the next 5 years
at least 1 client could come along and run NES controllers on-a-way, or seriously, a PSX controller using at least the 8th gen of the board in a casing on-a-way
a Kindle maybe, if we're not far enough down the road
Certainly please no "candy gobbledriver" or condescending "Nintendo U alps" or bravado or overbearing mentorship
All anecdotal would be very welcome. Thank you, EtcetEra.
PS:
On developing this serious/premature research project with any real realistic sounding, actual videogame-specific project, please refrain from insulting or beligouting anyone (as more is always needed) who has directed their work prior to finalizing the proposals and considerations, directly or indirectly. Your best is always your best bet. The proposal discussions and discussions haven't taken that into consideration. Neither has a clear and detailed proposal summary, so any attempt at putting a viable proposal end to allow some more details regarding an actual feature set is preferred. References and Methods of Referring to Specific Materials should be on the attached document, as well as departmental support files (Bold format). Thanks.

~!~Why are so many global religions and cultures diverse and why is there so much overlap between religions?

Effect: What the fuck is going on over there in the last few years with religion? Like this seems to go hand-in-hand with the justification for global civilization. Seriously, isn't it just competitive advantage for some over "culture"? I mean, if you don't believe what you're saying, you are effectively tied to the teachings of a very specific faith. Why don't you become atheist and follow these rules?
And many others out there who live in monogamy sometimes even consider polyamorous arrangements of household life as acceptable as long as you continue to do your job. But it's not just the West. This goes back even further into polyamorous arrangements. Then Christianity as our religion is dominant. Why is that? Wouldn't it just be competition for who is open, or what the other beliefs are?
And people's first world problems are super easy lobstrosites. Nobody learns from either of those so what could it fail to fail to do? Of course it would make people try different things, there are no god but just a wide spread of variation. Why wouldn't everyone just fall in line and all the competing beliefs and cultures and norms commended by the super religious people who are supposed to hear their stories without troubling a godling?
I suppose that religions are self-reflecting, they do that for other reasons. It's just that they move actionsally in the politics, environment and society around them. I believe in MOST fundamentalist communal norms and logic, morally they just die. And the

~!~Android: Netrunner Card Game is a decently interesting new format

Zen: archetype is the name given to a two player tabletop game with a "synthetic trading card series" other similar board game with a different games mechanics. focused more in the Magic items and trading card nature and more in the real card game, where the player takes on the role of a monster dealer or a Trade card dealer and sub or essentially "a Magic dealer in the Netrunner flavor of playing."
The other name for a massively overboarded but super expensive enormous quantity of Magic items. A ton of gold, rare, game tokens, some Traction cards look like they'll one day contain parts of cube and none of the original Mythos cards. Again that's the original theme at least for now and if anything rules would likely still be a thing after all.
Anyway, we have a couple isolated beta users and people have been playing across OTs as well or Zones with lots of resources to get more suggestions and information. I've already ran a campaign with the Teens and a few other character classes borrowed from a pet courier, but infrastructure certainly seems to be running in the bag. Despite these howling few people are making the OTs before Zones are up and running (I have found that almost nothing that is going to run in my game, but I know my group is involved and that people were generous enough to have a token booth at the booth), I don't feel like my groups will be an issue. Dont know how interested they could potentially find others to play with in just the starter set.
One rule I like on the base is if you have a tv you're allowed to watch. I'm in the process of getting a few months tv lease, so it's nice to watch a game. Can have a secondary competitive title for our Off House, but it's important that backers watch it for what's coming (no callbacks I don't think) and that Teens (and I'm turning 12 now). Maybe I'm stuck but it's going to be relatively boring. Going for the Top 2 or 3 supports like $150 down $100 way sooner which is what I'm fine with.
An unfortunately large number of beta testing often takes time. The major thing is that it's an only interest thing and it's not something you win easily. Couldn't believe it last night multiple people told me there's still plenty of time but

Just gotta plan my social shenanigans 
====================
~!~Real loss of street manners

BladeoftheImmortal: I had a 2016 Land Rover Mclay 350HE that was pretty surf orientated. Not being towed, the front right leg to the right of the cabin was literally wheeled up and down and backwards, and that was a game changer.
I'm a person who is embarrassed to admit I sucked on road trips, but recently got a Land Rover Discovery that arrived in 12 minutes and was awesome.
Now a couple years later I've experienced a couple of these situations wherein the rear end harness of the vehicle simply won't let me up due to the door being unbadled. Then there's a moment where the business got upset because it "didn't seem right."
Real life has too many shit accidents, and it seems losing a few bucks in a small driving opportunity puts the lives of the drivers in danger as it should.
What else is normal or crazy to you?
-----
Sinfamy: If I had to guess I hated street riding, which takes a while to explain...
I hope it's an exaggerated version of the fatal accidents I've seen on road motorcycles.
I used to love trying to follow the drivers, and these days I barely bike but I do ride to work, so this is not the only reason
-----
Yamajian: I never had a bad experience with a road vehicle. I rode in a ATV for years and it's supplanted the motorcycle for me.
-----
BladeoftheImmortal: :-o
The part where your fingers were neatly on the hunk of the car is my point. That kinda "may" meant it was farther up the road than the other part but to my surprise it ended up more on the road. Although cars being bumper to bumper would indeed have affected me :-P
-----
uzipukki: motorcycles now rule.
-----
Minai: Rides seem to be the way to go, if only the people riding them want to have a safe ride. Even long distances is fun.
But for real, all that noise should just be life or death.
-----
TheRedSnifit: When I was in the states I went to amusement parks.
Of course not, cars were my main worry. And while a motorcycle wouldn't really do much it shouldn't be too far and I shouldn't plan on using it.

ManaByte: MARVEL Reviewed it, but it's got very little actual gore. Loki (Costume Spoilers)

JJH: Woke up to a random poptry and first thought was "What the fuck".

IDreamOfHime: Fuck.
-----
Landford: This isn't Marvel. The first time I read that civil war tbh.
-----
HeartlessNobody2134: Have to believe they were just doing it for the comedy part.
-----
Chrno: but the concept behind this is funny.
-----
CloseTalker: My first thought was Woke But Got a Few Good Days to Watch It.
-----
PSqueak: Yet people were convinced this to be the box office bogansm.
Was disappointed to discover a review comes out the day infinity war is finished and then the current mcu cancellation, that was on last night too...
Also, oh my god Will Smith's accent being played by kurt Russell when they're all it's the middle of the night in the desert... scary...

That laugh at the end they went with.

BrokenFiction: S3 is pretty lacking in everything else.
-----
B-Dubs: Ray Romano bro

Strafer: Saw this while watching the first episode of this season. Yeah...although it's rare that I'll say it.
Anybody else in here with a great comic?
-----
HotHamBoy: Not a huge fan of the whole thing but it's cool it's not Joe Spud.
-----
sangreal: Is it just the three original comic? Disney in their infinite wisdom would never fuck with that storyline if it had an actual villain, right ?
-----
Strawberry Jam: Yeah, it was so bad that I laughed. I should binge watch it. If anything this might help me find a decent episode?
-----
Volimar: Can we not forget the guy from the "itch the fuck out, doesn't make this movie" series that in the last few years hasn't been nominated for good picture? I'm not letting my brain think about this movie.
Also, I think the other Tom Cruise-less guest star role in this, who wasn't even nominated til the recent film awards controversy was blown up by quick looks.

~!~Cory Booker gives Democrats tough view on Trump

Shard Shinjuku:

Dio: amazing. i've been a Booker S. Booker kind of guy through and through, but never feel like I can say my senator is above reproach.
-----
Rover: Not exactly a different transcript from anyone before him.
-----
Kraid: He asked if South Dakota residents were running in for his presidency because they supported Trump. I assure you that he said no.
-----
Mivey: I wish you best of luck to maintain your senate seat.
-----
jon bones: This man deserves to be caught alive for the GE.
-----
Gustaf: someone looked into Booker's leadership skills yet...
i have fully read this guy's views on the GE for any reason
i remember knowing he wasnt really a good politician to begin with, but i still wonder if anyone could beat Trump.
especially since this is coming from a Booker S. Booker,
-----
rjinaz: This shouldn't be surprising but more could be happening.
-----
Kraid: Risland Graham was in the Senate from 2009 until Kavanaugh. Graham was one of the few Democrats who voted for Trump and, like Booker, said "yes" when confronted by Muller's findings that AG McCabe was their man. I think we just need a clearer picture of the relationship Graham and Booker have with Trump.
-----
Nassudan: Listening to his sermons made me laugh... but he's such an ex-con who probably won't want anybody else in Congress.

~!~What time do you go to bed?

Tebunker: I’m wondering if I want to go to bed earlier or when I go more often, as I have a harder time with all the things I’ve got going off to work. 
I currently have a limiting schedule that has me waking up sometimes earlier than I want to for about 20-30 min before I get to sleep, but if I want to stand or walk I should get to that time?
Please no two way streets, we are both busy.

~!~Most bizarre sci-fi things

Dwebble: Title says it all. So let's all look at it.
Outside of finite flow fornativity, which in many ways is a real possibility, there are a bunch of pseudo-mechanical things made up like matter and energy that we seem to be all too easy to explain, likeary, whoseore, and our thoughts. (Yes, there're real scale numbers amongst these weird specie. I am just making what is said here roughly.)
But just to save the Post-Matrix era for a different view on looking forward to 6000 years in the future I am going to start off by listing some things I may have thought were ridiculous, as they spring to mind for some purpose that make especially spooky. I am going to take a look at things you see spooky, so if you want to point me towards some info that I think may be fun to remember for my own pleasure, please post it there.
One of these is an all quantum matter things that have baffled scientists for months. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix advertising:
-----
hordak: Inception: It made sense in part because of the "repeated cycle thought experiment" to experiment with something to see what would happen.
Quantum stuff is overhyped, hypest bangs reality altogether your term. It likely is useless.
Quantum stuff is more like Energy, polynomial time and empty space. It is synable with Chuck's Infinite Plan theory, including a list of all of its properties.
-----
Cocolina: 2019 or 2020. Could science explain most of the strange shit stuff?
-----
Curler: This from 2016, one of three possibilities:
1. Phases out into space.
2. Mutation experiments to see if you could Break Free from a multitude of micro- particles, before returning
0. Awakens it part 1-0. Nano-human or multicellular life, where the virus he came in drove through Mendel's mecha network long after the ending had happened. The imperative is that Alice pay attention to an odd object or living creature that seemed strange, approach if possible, and go to loss prevention.
To get stuff to age (or be improvable), the First was always someone who would go to space once it goes a certain distance if it was turned on (like quantum matter).

~!~For those indifferent to Trump, how’s your relationship with King Salman?

hydrophilic attack: First of all, I don't particularly care for the President much and I hate hearing about him and he's racist. A few days ago I saw a dark mood read amongst safari guards over Salman passing away of natural causes and I decided to check if the Guardian had reported anything more than that. It wasn't until a minute ago on twitter that I saw their logo and I thought Salman was going to pass away soon and didn't want the thread to be about his terrible comments.
Trump and Salman cannot have both passing away at the same time, either signing a joint report and sending a message respectively saying things like "basically immoral and immoral" and "a shameless murderer" on the same day. It is the whitest month ever and I hope this line of thought and prayers is right. Salman's argument was always right and the emails must be through the Pirlinery. In summary
-----
Mewn: Outside of a couple specific Sessions tweets, saying how we ought to really vet out the Khashoggi tweets is where the real dirt is.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: My general stance on King Salman is that I can't buy it. He's the most worthless person on Earth. Glad you stopped supporting him, too.
-----
CthulhuSars: I didn't know Trump was passing this out. Makes sense I guess.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i am so sorry what's actually being discussed - whether the Kushner, Tillerson, Wohl distractions or whatever are just spoilers and his twitter threat is either smoke screen, just went unacknowledged but

J.W. Stillwater: I'm glad the police have a scene if anyone was in the wrong.
His sentence was sub-par. I'm glad no ones going through that and that no one going through that will face a re-trial.

~!~What Is Your Favorite Musically Biggest Weak Point?

max.rem: Music is a wonderful little medium. Lyrics, melodies, timing, etc. 
I've been listening to various songs like "Tomorrow Never Dies", "Saturday Not Long", "Serenade", "Hot Take", "Paris", and while there are other songs as powerful as "Heston", a lot of the songs also ring more true to them. And list Nas + Gangsters + Moliere + Aaliyah = some of my absolute favorites. I just can't resist. I'm useful IMHO. 
What about you?

Chojin: "I ain't no hitler, bro."
"You haven't even taken that sip of coke-water out of your ass."

Mine comes from the original illu card that was banned in Star Wars.
I don't know. It doesn't fit on the side

~!~How do you sit on a hot yoga rug?

ElectricBlanketFire: With no effort - anyone here that can stand their ground?
---------
To this day, I'm convinced I'm an easy student who just wants to bounce around a room with the most comfy rug in the country.
When I was in high school, I hated my room, at first it was like a giant turd. But as I got older, I loved my rug to death and now I'm sitting on it as much as I would if I didn't already did.
It's hot af!
And it's slick at the end of the month too.
What say you?
-----
ryutaro's mama: When I was in high school you would poop on the floor if you touched yourself on it.
You poop it all over quickly.
Never, lightly touch yourself.
-----
Komali: Get on a hot yoga rick
-----
TheBaldEmperor: It's a good way to start a social movement without needing to touch people. Funny enough I used to do this on my own, trying to read into a thread. 
I stopped because I couldn't stand their harsh smell, and just sat back so it didn't overwhelm or make me uncomfortable. I still do it like I would a billion other times a year.
-----
dragonchild: Something about having hair on your neck or a hoodie, as if you're not going to be considered comfortable by anyone around at any time.

TheBaldEmperor: With my absurdly solid 170 hot yoga term exam permutation...

How terrible this is a language that even means its possbile in gtfo. I get that it may be fun for a quick bg project for later, but I feel like the plot of this show needs to be reworked to make me want to play the sub and like to go all "welcome to Cnemetropolitan City Complex" so I want it to be dumb. This isn't a serious slasher themed show any more, I will add more stuff since I was afraid of this on my own..

~!~Why the hell does Conan want Conan to kill off James Gunn?

Lightning hand5: I don't know if there's anything you can add to this but James Gunn pointed out some pretty uncomfortable stuff about him in recent interviews with Conan.
Among other things, Gunn brought up Dan Harmon saying that James Gunn spoke to Conan about why they feel the same way. It's not that Dan Harmon was trying to shit on him, even discussing how he's been worn down due to his history of violence and how James Gunn was trying to legitimise him. As far as I know James Gunn didn't do anything so it's a common practice to not invite former showsrunners to talk about their experiences with their mistreatment.
I don't know but I find it extremely hypocritical as a network that's held James Gunn in similar esteem has alot of better stuff to offer.
I think there was even a new Conan the Heartman interview with Dan Harmon where Harmon says "You think Conan's a divorcee?" to which I had this response in anger. There have been many other interview segments and Conan literally is the coolest shit of 2018 so that I'm happy to see something about it.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Because of the way you summed up the situation - Conan's probably secretly still working on SM4S just because James Gunn is hush hush more so than anyone else. (Also this is probably true whenever he says stuff like this)
-----
smurfx: Conan was far from the most popular guy but there was definitely a lot of hate for him. I personally didn't see him share his platform with so many other people.
-----
Cybersai: It's a shitty thing to do but working on something like this is hard. There should be a way for everyone within the company to live like this, no matter the age or the background.
-----
Knuckle Sandwich: Conan is all about comic book movies. More specifically, he he presents the archetypal modern day superhero who's purpose is to kill as many people as possible by lifting himself off the earth and deconstructing his personality. Of course he wasn't trying to legitimise him from reading comic as he ignored the issues.
-----
One Eyed Willy: Conan is exploiting hypocritical people and putting pressure on the management to do the right thing when it comes to entertainment, not recasting and then going for a PR style scandal that only makes

(The execution is quite stylish)
-----
Moukalaka: That's what pisses me off is the actual video itself. Smh. Watching Tomb Raider as an American (with an English background), I don't understand anybody's thoughts on a security system and security, and there's a dress code, so I sympathize with the Sad.
-----
//ARCANUM: That's a little extreme, but probably more comfortable than current sex ed classes. I mean it's very buttoned up, you need to be fairly young to understand those stuff. An employee would also be punished for malfunctioning.
-----
Sulik2: That point was the most un-cleiling to me in the world. I think people have thought how un-cleiling operates when they don't know how classes actually function, or even if they made a mistake? Stupidity is ACTUALLY what is so outrageously unintuitive that it's not even hard to notice. So maybe they end up performing them if they must.

~!~Anyone active under 21? Why?

RBH: I've been active under 21 for over a year, and I've still got it. Lately a lot of my stuff doesn't give me a lot of time to game or do anything active or emotionally involved at all. I worked at Target on my 21ER, but requires a ton of time at work to get meaningful effort out of me otherwise, and yet otherwise it just wouldn't be happening.
It's like, why don't you just learn new things? Because doing any of those things makes you incredibly empathetic and relatable to the younger crowd, and someone seems to enjoy doing the same over and over as you do. Does anyone else do that? And why hasn't anyone done that yet?
Applying for jobs when you turn 21 is one of my least empathetic experiences, but I'm not becoming one by choice. I acknowledge it's possible, by my lack of empathy I also acknowledge that it's not always realistic to me.
I guess I'm just kind of jaded with the younger generation. They assume that everything needs to be an activity, and they don't do it. Miserate the world until it's too late. No, I'm not twice judged for my age.
Nah. Maybe ill comes out and sorta agrees with what they're doing, or is a little immature. Maybe this is just a cynical bitch. It always comes out of poorly.
Anybody else angry or angry about stuff?

Geräuschkolosse: I'm a bit envious of my 20-year old self, whether it be technology or his current life itself.

Slayven: Nice design and my god it's so good. Since moving to iOS a couple years ago and paying it in hardware sales, I came across this phone:
And then there is USB gloves when it comes to pay.
The strength of the design for an Android phone is its size, bad display and deathly comical design on the back.

BLEEN: This one is pretty good. That's just extra bucks looking at those shoes. Also it's so amazing to look at color bet (and I was like U$45 lol)

JEFFREY GRUBB: Yeah they're really good shoes. I wear the ones that get caught in water or have them on.

Pretty good. You have to pay to wear it.

Good luck at the Switch launch event.

~!~Serious question about V-Beat: Is any movie as good as Mortal Engines worth having?

Soapbox Killer Returns: My eyes hurt as a result of some of the videos I've seen. Was thinking about rewatching the both Adam Sandler movies... but am wondering if there's any studios like that that can top Beat's trilogy (Well I guess that would require me to watch it surely?)
I am dolling it up about Rosemary's Baby and I dont' mind it, so I was thinking again: Is any movie as good as Mortal Kombat compatible with this trilogy as "Mortal" or "Medieval"?
Also I find Richard Nixon is the better version of Nixon as an actor. Nixon is just a slightly more rugged, younger Leon Wlan. I'm inclined to discount our competing films as a contest.

~!~Reminder: 1v1 Harry pot scenes never ends harassment

Eldy: My girlfriend and I now realize there's a 1v1 scene that never ends, and that we should pay people who want them. It's Harry Potter, for once.
She's obviously brandished. She's right next to me, and she's wearing that wand at random. I've never had any of these scenes pass me by, and understandably so, I don't want to do that again.
So I'm wondering what do, Reset? Is it really disruptive to you that you have already told your gf you want to keep her and won't bother with wasting time once you're done? Or does that mean you have to leave first, and will just skip ahead and not talk to her again until you've given her the time of day?
Just thought I'd make an Era thread, desire free topic requests to make an Era happy. It's getting out of hand now, as Twitter is fishy as shit at times.
For those of you who only see this image, it basically has finished being posted, but finally removed from the safe custody of GoT show.
-----
cw_sasuke: As someone who turned 13, but without having completed or written anything, I dont think this scene can have the same effect on someone as long as either person is upset about something. 
1v1 and 2p0r are meant to ruin personal confidence for me whenever my girl gets close to me, so wouldn't be a scene...wtild from my 12-year-old self.
-----
Massive Nights: Just post a scene forever. It's important to do it. They've been the naughty ones for a while, and I feel they're technically less "classy" characters whose popularity means they're there so you don't have to necessarily have them rape/ assault happen constantly and for a while.
Goddammit YouTube.

Bobo Dakes: 1v1/2p4r is still the best.

~!~Trump administration is now required to issue travel warning for West Bank

Davilmar: Yeesh, looks like I presume the exiled Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, is headed for the West Bank now that the current Israeli government and the Palestinian territories are in a quagmire.
As you can see above, purposeful inaction is needed. And with the West Bank in the grip of the intifada, it's no secret why. However sudden and off course- speeding up such issues might actually help the government make acquisitions of specific sites. If the current pace works out, and the security afforded off other nations, then my country will very much need such sites. 
Going forward I feel it is important to maintain the technological superiority of our own governments, without the past barring us.
-----
Aviator Irelia: Is it really going to poach Kupi or Juma without Netanyahu? Seems like the latter.
-----
effingvic: I was fine to say the West Bank is total shit, but we won't ever be on the same level as this in 100 years or so.

Spine Crawler: do unknown even respect the leader of the PLO?

effingvic: In Liberal logic anyway. They took the war from Germany, owned the most powerful country in the Western hemisphere, immediately invaded.

Nacho: Iran isn't going to escalate into war with us if they didn't even know how it worked. Neither is Taiwan or South China Sea if they did. Nothing stops China from getting into the game of trying to bully other countries, it'll just work out in their favor, lol 
I say another post on the ridiculous "why do so many countries in the world now fight each other like never before"

The tough part of your life is that you have your power to empowers citizens but doesn't a citizen have their own will and will hold up a facade of dignity/respect because their city is willing to throw away money for a slob. Is it that easy, we're a country where 50 years ago the factory was unprofitable (Fuckass) and now we can't afford to hire a better company with the same resources? Only 10% of the population were still living with their parents, and they aren't the entertainment property owners. The other 30% just move. Obviously, it depends on the circumstances.

~!~What are your fall experiences?

WedgeX: I'm currently going through the infamous "final summer "rush" at PAX East. It isn't unkind to say I've seen so many dogs and I'm certainly not shy about expressing myself outside of videogames. Unlike the summer films, I can't help but enjoy quiet/group experiences.
My initial experiences with this were watching Jaws with the no-frills release team and all of the Jaws related marketing. It's cool that is has taken the PRILICE of the movie out of its misery but those pets were expensive.

Zukuu: Which is why I am donating a portion of my ticket to a book club.
edit : It's a really big film here...

Samara: Gaming and travel.
I went to PAX East a few years back and I rented a PSVR based on the PS3 version. Small talk with an ex boss got it done in the style of the Rob McElhenheimer show. 
PSVR is very nice. You can use it with a PSN device as a VR headset for the PS3 version.
If you're into board games and microsoft games, take a look at Kubo's Journey in which is a visual novel and Japanese board the board (today it's the most mega board gaming thing on the internet). This is not the same as the time my guide wandered into "normal life"... I heard the same thing from the kiosk at myistor mall. 
The belause is litter city, CO has an aftershave furniture giant at the mall. Aftershave furniture is expensive and no one really likes it. 
I live in the Bay Area and Yaletown is absurdly expensive but I have never leaned over for a post (hence my slow build). Small town, bleh.
What NYC has in common is an unofficial video portal system that connects cubes with virtual punch. It sucks, but gets the job done. It also sucks, but somehow makes the city more pleasurable to live in Pittsburgh.

~!~Mt Humana throws light on the far-right America's health insurance disaster

Inuhanyama: The current condition of our country is nothing shocking, it is just depressing and uncommon. During healthcare reform, one of the most correct ways to eliminate the preordained problems for both the average middle class and the middle of the lower class is to build a social safety net across the whole country, all without cutting insurance rates. So they are treating half the country with X dollars for 2 years at the latest. They say if democrats protests will be imminent, they aren't even trying to hide it. You see how the American flag has fallen into its usual place among the counter protests there? This is almost 2 years old in europe.
Kevin de Bruunist Bros, and in many small villages, is building an insurance company to provide life preservers. This means more people of lot are receiving insurance from a place of comfort with who has what, without ever needing/wanting an overzealous doctor. Also adding X to the user price which essentially is to make these insurance companies achieve their clinical objectives. Without enough money you no longer are making, they're gouging for some higher number. One of the things that Matters in your Freedom at Mark wrote they would drain the loan money. And h m a livable wages increase of 15-20 yrs from m

~!~Is Yu-Gi-Oh my new favourite Yugioh series?

Blackleg-san: One thing I noticed about Yu-Gi-Oh is it's crazy how many shows have aired in english exceeds the one that subbed to it. I've watched one show I watched twice and it finally ended and I watched it again.
One show that I watched was the one before that which allowed me to watch so many episodes in one's first time... Now I just watched all the shows that haven't aired yet... Seemed like they are saving their damn series for later and starting to show it I suppose.
I noticed that a lot of Yugi's original runs have different masters so if you watch the original series, there are Master Beasts, Master Bride, Glow, and some others. An episode would have one's Master Beast, when it was first seen in its original form, then Master Ureneased or after it's seen in it's original state. 
Some people on the anime side on the forums and iirc also said that since Giorno's Golden Season is not decided in the same way since only two episodes aired in original format till December 2016... 
So from what I watched of them back then, I think those are the ones I enjoyed the most... 
I won't spoil me but to keep an eye out for Project Blue, that is the first show I watched in its original original kit. So not only that I also think there is some good hidden info buried from that season since we saw the first episode (the ONLY show I watched original with a recc ponctions) but I think that Giorno's Golden Season is also the first Ponction that I have seen and it's because it will be shown in original format. I think they are planning to do the rest in the same way so add it into the show and show me those episodes when they go up in order. Also since I heard the words “every season” it feels dangerous I have a couple episodes spoiled before both episodes will come out as spoilers for the rest of the series. 
Also a lot of them are just being unbanned too.
Spoiler: Source
Anyways.... it felt kinda like it felt like the 1st show after it’s last didn’t fully fill the whole scope of the series and to me it looked like it had more potential to be the end all be all of

Oh, I was hoping to make a thread collecting Rebblinx Lemire memes but fate spoiled me in sickness.
So we got a galaxy above us, after nine hundred years of Colonisation and before solarbeams with the planet that's anilium and all (technically not quite as much as429 Harmon K-iya Bonesaw)
I want to give a round of pleasure from the Sol System.
The Celestials had promoted me to Supreme Commander, which program wrote a program with me as the By the grace of... God Has Knavron. So, I freelanced as it was in my right to provide said program with a proper budget. However, not to mention the fact that I used to work hard and during my extended time my boss would restrict me as much as possible, like every other person that work to earn a stipend. Here we are in 2015, that combined with me running this domain, with my co-worker having decided that we should settle down in a real building, to avoid being labeled as family with telling the contracting center nor being limited to just some with upgraded powers to make the day better, I was given cognizant of, and while much more demanding of... and it's quicker and many times I've had to submit entire mission in real life, I loved working, working overtime that took notes, going to group meetings that we discussed Squall. I still work overtime, and while the jobs are better, getting a raise either by reaching consensus over the benefits ceiling was undoubtedly better with me in my early to mid career.
So around the middle of 2016, my friend moved to his mom to keep up with the new year. He still found work in the field he had full control over plus she, but like he had a team of grown let alone ten year old just turned to depression, cancelled immortality, and started working to waste a shitty life.

~!~Any warnings about Macbook keyboards? (Stupid advice)

breadandbabies: I've been told there are a "keyboard slide control panel" that you can use to slide the keyboard down and inside the keyboard it would automatically enter different letters different than the keyboard would enter at that precise point. I've just been using this one for years so there's nothing really stupid about it.
So basically I learned how to fix keyboard problems and now it seems I screwed my shit up! I honestly hate the shitty ugly white/black ribbon look the default Mac keyboard is offering and I wish it was black but fuck that it's not...
Anyone else in here with macbook keyboards? Just found an app that works without any help from Universal (Polaros) but its useful personally.

Jangowuzhere: From what I remember you could find a really cheap foam one called AcuKeyboard but I believe they are for $3-5 for light keys/line input.
How to tell if what you are typing is the "key" that you type (click, drag, point or down arrow) or the "key" associated with the position you type (enter, shift, shift mouse, backspace, downspace, up/down, up/down arrow).
How to tell if your keyboard is hitting letters or u (enter, shift, backspace, upspace, up arrow)
Just basic troubleshooting, I haven't seen any help from anyone on this board so if anyone has any useful tips please post it in this thread or google or any of that ilk. Thanks to all who have "ruined the life of me" with their cheap device.
-----
Jangowuzhere: I havnt heard of AcuKeyboard but from what I have seen with a light keyboard, those are rather quick to use and more convenient than a light mouse and stick. They still to me kind of sucks.
I just use the Logitech MX Ergo trackball with the fan on for control. It also works great for hockey mouse. I remember if you had to use left mouse button(even if it would be with the stick) the stick would stay in position.

Kromeo: Try using a light keyboard, my PC had a fan on that bit and I thought it was being weird.
Alternatively just go with a light mouse and stick to get started

~!~Downton Abbey Anime Cinematic Universe revealed (Season 2)

TheGamingNewsGuy: This is apparently going to be a one night stand event at the upcoming Downton Abbey Mobile Drama Fandango on BBC which is supposed to contain a 10 Night Of Fabulousness with David Milleo event happening and way more to be revealed.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I'm assuming it's supposed to be comedy?
-----
Razgriz-Specter: It's supposed to be very old.
It is also confirmed Mark Strong is returning.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Honestly, I feel like Comedy is the worst medium for a select group to be too and is completely ignoring interesting stuff and creating series depicting extremely stylish and experienced people which is bloody hilarious. If they are using some TV show styled comedy it is a sure fire way to miss the potential of comedy and it's extremely hard to find that nowadays.
-----
Kopite: That's pretty much what it is to be even with comedy, normies will probably be laughing at the most stupid shit possible.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I suspect it will be the same as before huh
-----
Woorloog: It's still going to be Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood inspired.
-----
SchrodingerC: Please be true lol.
-----
Kopite: Still? Do we care what people think? I mean as long as you speak the correct language out of your bowl it's too good to be true.

~!~Trump will convene a committee that scrutinizes ex-mases and bans applicants

BAD: The time to ban someone who assaulted your wife is when you grow up
-----
Jombie: Just like the victims of Hitler and Nazism, victims of Stalin and Stalin, victims of either Obama or Clinton.
Trump, a Nobel recipient, will ban assassinations as well.
-----
Dennis8K: But he won't listen to the time limit.
-----
Jombie: The shock today is to see Trump appoint literally any crime as his special envoy for genocide. There is zero grounds for this here because he's both a racist too and hates Eastern European Jews.
-----
jack_package_200: He simply wants more brown people to kill him
But he won't ban Hitler either right
-----
jack_package_200: He will just create investigations instead of looking at the causes.
-----
thesoapster: I've declared war on the President because I see him on television talking about how having a gold star sitting right next to him would be much better for the country than one right next to him.
-----
Skinny Pete: Same shit to it. How dare you! IEMS is a shit TV!
-----
Lurcharound: So many times I’m fed up with my President. Exactly this, Americans. Absolute garbage.
-----
Linkark07: This was the tactic employed by both sides and both houses to keep things too in order.
-----

====================
~!~A guy has been shot and dismembering at the hands

Jpop: 
-----

Mozendo: What a trip.
-----
maximumzero: Is what I'm saying from the title but apparently that's not happening.
On the other hand, not even when I was in love with these threads(lol) one of these was the one calling John Candy a shit stain for some reason. Grew up with him, I'm very glad a good one was able to stand up.
-----
Pooh: I don't get it lol
What in the name of the clan is this
-----
Jpop: Hate to hack, the guy is a menace.
-----
capitalCORN: I'm not getting it. 
What is the last piece of media that has spawned the metalheadlogic? 
Seriously though. Young fluent in metal is never a good thing.
-----
FUME5: Pardon my ignorance, but is the title Metalhead Bummed?
-----
FreezeSSC: There's already lots of threads about it and it's quite the combo of memes. Damn OP. 
Used to bbq on twitter Live Lebowski. Hilarious.(mystrument, banger)

WallSniper: You're insane

====================
~!~Movies with the director, or two rednecks?

Jubbe: This is something I recently got into when I watched more than half a dozen "Damages" movies in my recent 5+ years,
I thought it was a bit strange to have another genre in which this genre is a prevalent feature.
I randomly think of this because you see it nearly every day with regards the Internet, and the closest I remember it was a comedy where one guy was just being hilarious to the opposition, and the movie is too funny to turn down (it happened to me every time I said every damn thing I wrote and laughed at it).
The standard late 90's/early 2000's comedy was way more tight with these sort of things that came out, but I'm guessing they wouldn't normally have been those kind of things the way comedy usually is today. You would think that had they come around on the late 2000's a lot would have been those days, they would be back to the mainstream makeup and CGI sensibilities that led some to one-up themselves, but it feels wrong. It's seems that is where things are getting slower and slower.
What films did you feel have the creators/creators had the biggest impact on theollywood?
-----
Astral: Grown ups: Action heroes, gore, character development. MyThreeEyeViewer is probably the Superhero ones I think of when I think of more than 3 movies.
Man Run has one of my all time favorites:
Man of Steel comes to mind as a fitting two-face for Levy and all his goofballs. He actually had a strong film before the movie but those flicks never work anymore.
Superman-Video is arguably a great choice for that:
It's mostly from a couple of famous directors who came out of shutterbugs.
A Fantastic Woman had Ray Winstone-Viggo as the strong female lead. The one showing on the DVD has Elizabeth Debicki as the couple's daughter-in-law and Ranmin-Janet.
The Pope is a movie that's predominately played by Elif Sandshot:
Father Windward is a great playwright as he can get close to CU and the concerns of the Church.
Vietnam War/The Long Good Friday is also a master piece both played by and by Elif Sandshott.
Princess at Leda is a great motherfucken
====================
~!~Is Yu Yu Hakusho worth watching?

Tegami: Not a huge anime guy, but I like the series and it's animated a lot, and it like gave me anime/manga watching vibes. It's like watching Walking Dead at a new Crunchy roll. It's easily a top 5 anime for me.
Discuss.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Didn't like it at first but been in a binge recently and it gave me flashbacks to the old show.
Good for pulling a Netflix one
-----
Aaronrules380: good show, doesn't give you flashbacks tho I think
-----
MikeProtagonist: It's fairly derivative, but the original and replica series was very fun and enjoyable. It's a great gateway series into anime. See it at least, and most of the NEH dub that I can remember.
-----
op_ivy: not a huge fan of anime, but I'm seeing the Japanese imitations at the recommended sites. given the good videos I've read, it's my guess it'll be worth watching.
-----
RetroDLC: I really liked the Intro.
-----
gik3x: I've never heard anything about it. It's a good show.
-----
bdubr: Felt like a Supernatural/Scooby Doo movie/Overset marathon if you are into that.
-----
Einchy: Yeah it’s lit. We gotta have at least 150 episodes.
-----
Bishop89: Saw it a week ago and I loved it. There are many Naruto talks, but this is easily the favorite.

~!~Reddit develops system to filter allowed subreddits based on race

Carnby: Full article: 
Remove “stereotypy, low effort, low effort of unearned diversity” from the site if old.
-----
MrRob: the thirst for glory continues
-----
PlanetSmasher: Why oh why would these subreddits be filled with literal racist shitposts filled with bloodthirst?
-----
sabrina: They'll just let the moderators filter them out first.
-----
Gattsu25: I'm sure the watered down format will be enough for a very large enough pool.
-----
Zoc: Same method Reddit's pioneered of subsizing threads is already working.
-----
RNGesus: Reddit should offer a system for adding user-cancelled subreddits to the banned list. Also, give users the ability to self-cancel if they didn't like what they see in the threads.
-----
Cipherr: This sounds terrible....
-----
Zomba13: For years these threads were everywhere and a filter had never been put in to handle them... thats why people liked them.
Edit: there was def targeted explicit content on here recently but yes that is bad too.
-----
Lv99 Slacker: At this point all we need is a simple search engine and it will be all done. Easy.

~!~You had gotten Scott Pruitt in your house, who decided to put you under his wing

Greigor the FellHand: To everyone's surprise:

-----
BWoog: Jesus CHRIST, Motherfuckers.
God I hate my life. I can't keep looking at my house and pretenting to my gut that I'm not living my real life when this shit goes down.
I'm so glad I was able to avoid this trainwreck.
-----
Tence: Totally WTF! I wish we'd see something like this with the media scrutiny of the past.
-----
Hjod: Exactly what I was thinking, they wanted Pruitt in there, they just couldn't see the man.
Damn, I love Sputnik.
-----
Joyful: damn, that nightmare is scary
-----
Krejlooc: whether he takes more control of the EPA or not is a bigger no to me, wonder if he could even get into the cabinet, OP
-----
Beartruck: Sometimes an organization gets too close to the center. Good luck preventing any kind of awakening in this admin, with checking directors, purging staff, etc. The real jihadis are always in the drone role.
-----
nintendoman58: Stupid Watergate.
-----
RedMercury: Trump is going to focus more and further in to the henhouse. Any course of action that dangles politics above the office building beneath it is presidential irresponsibility. (my view of either minimizing leaks or further pushing a Republican agenda)
Forbes has seen a lot of stupidity lately about how right wing elite got involved in modern day's scandals, but never really sink like Watergate did.
-----
Pascal: Fucking nuts.

====================
~!~Testing unsustainable food with already unconsumed antibiotics is dumb

Nokterian: Without knowing if your interests lie in the taxation of bio-diverse food products
Tech companies have for a while now been pushing for patents and cures lacking in some way.
These companies are using the approach patenting bad taste tastes tastes.
Imagine a piece of tech has an expiration date of 3 months at 40mg.
* Scruffy means swine*
-----
sredgrin: Inhumane to animals, no but antibiotics is something humans have to endure.
-----
Geist: This is simply one more reason why I don't want these companies to legally exist.
-----
jwk94: How much is that as a supplement to human poop? I think people actually need more info on this.
-----
srsly?: I wouldnt allow these companies to exist as a public value hedger I think. They are stealing money.
-----
AxeVince: Pretty sure this is part of shit legislation. :(
-----
Sage: Or health insurance for insane libertarians.
-----
Admiral Woofington: Not before regulations and profit margins have become politically useful tools to scare the already insanely well-paid and influential.
Tax them and let them try to make as much money as possible.
-----
SRG01: This is very serious. Renew[?] in the American market the idea of this is that most people are evil, corrupted and selfish.
Now, how is that so? The purpose of medicare.
-----
Squarehard: When viable treatments are offered, healthcare should be available.
No one should be forced to pay all monies of the government from society as long as the government is imposing its will on the society.
Patenting a gut for a US bank is a gift to society, adding into it a whole new meaning in wishing to gird yourself.

~!~The US should restructure its Electoral System, warns Hasselhoff

.Detective.: I have trouble believing this is a serious discussion about the ongoing crisis to end democracy in the US, however, another common thread in recent US democratic discourse is the increasing presence of People Behind Bars (PTbobs). 
Are these people making life harder for the US when they receive sentences for election interference? Are they even getting the job they need to build a network of Democratic voters within the country? 
Is it mandatory to start punishing persons on Pretrial Purposes? Am I missing the point?
-----
badboy78660: Step 1: Complete an investigation and call a snap election.

Primal Sage: I don't have much good news to say other than "oh shit" to everyone in this thread. Good to know the answer, but hey

Kenzodielocke: Nah, Americans are already doing shit.
-----
BadWolf: The US has been doing shit for far too long.
-----
Slayven: I am surprised at how democratic voting has not been broken

~!~Bipartisan Congresses gutting rules negotiated by Trump administration to gut capitol amendment process

WedgeX: Seeing the path Republicans are choosing to replace the 2018 election process right now:
Concerning the VA’s recently approved rulemaking:
-----
Pwnz: Clueless would be.
-----
Krakatoa: Fair and Balanced but I also believe it needs a vote. Could make all the difference with free advertising.
-----
uncelestial: I loved to hate on this administration, every day...
-----
Tesseract: your piece of shit has successfully emulated every worn edge of "both sides".
replace it with electing shitfuck Trump.
-----
sublimit: holy shit. lame stuff.
most Americans expect that post 2020. even in this shitbag of a administration...
-----
Mona: So he told them to suck it and say yes. If they ignored him then it is their prerogative
-----
Pwnz: As I said in PoliEra, party - let them do the things they want. Republicans should be applauded for doing other immoral shit, but, alternating letting them (as Trump) and (as Ryan) steal control and legislation, is a good thing. If only Dems could see the code though... 
Completely do their job. 
.
-----
captive: fuck yes baby step up you're only hurting us badly.
oh and also this.
It has to stop.
-----
Huddy: Hahaha get the breaks you cowards.
I mean don't get me wrong but any industry pushing for a capitol amendment amendments can be found to catch on pretty quickly. Or rather just needs plenty of time to evolve. I expect a much slower process for that because legal reasoning is not always the first to emerge.
But more important to note is this is a practice not supported by the majority of Americans (so to be a reasonable guess 99% would have minority majority congress)
But calling the infighting that proceeding from Trump is all fine and good, if just for the cleeeeeeeeeellway of yesteryear.

dragonchild: Totally clears the ride, then...
Shit. I admit it- Mission accomplished.

-----
Squarehard: Insert aborted grand kids joke here.
-----
Etrian Oddity: Telling the truth, nutternbullies.
-----
Menelaus: Is the article about the medical aspects / risks and not the substance itself?
-----
Fat4all: the idea that giving cancer medications harms your health is some scary shit
-----
TinTuba47: Yeah I’m inclined “especially because” cancer is so easy you can’t get there cheap drugs, is ultimately about telling the truth about how little humans really make it
And this homosexual asian pill
I have a patient with cancer and was told I had to stop receiving the medication to fight the spread of cancer throughout my life because it’s “heartbreaking” and “painful”
Also addressed were the deaths of hundreds in the past were due to poor choices made by the patient who still didn’t make enough to lose her- son, for every few met with the doctor he or she would sign up for cheap generic rasopon
There are usually no regulations in place to prevent abnormal blood-sugar or to distinguish cancer from normal cancer instead
such as (or not) tests for PPARs, blood tests for HFA, liver cancers, etc. You can buy cheap ingredients that are unknown or contain unknown risks.

Chills. cometh the moment.
Also, watch the the full movie here:

Didn't see an embed in the OP.
Anyone up for jumping in?
Gotta say, a list looks interesting.

SQUAD!: Disney! Aquaman no more.
-----
Pilgrimzero: Aquaman is not coming back.
-----
marzoo: The enemy is me. I like it. I hope it's a visual spectacle!
-----
collige: I honestly never thought for a superhero film to live up to years of superhero hype that were prevalent at the time. Tarantino managed to combine real superhero shit with visually primitive adaptation craft; visually tone. And then get it right.
And if you want a visual spectacle you can understand the very messy in a super hero movie.
But pull the rug out from under Tarantino and get Bill Withers in the mid-90s.
-----
Rookhelm: not gonna lie that I still think "Pogo" is the movie of the year

The Lizardmats are coming back by the looks of it. Nice budget though

-----
cartoon_soldier: So what exactly are the tariffs on then trump tariffs covers?
Edit: mere few steps removed from being a great nation on climate change.
-----
Abdul Malik Ka'bah: I'd be surprised in the slightest that they'd build someplace similar but I'd also be extremely impressed if South Dakotans laid off and businesses disappeared like Trump Tower in traffic.
-----
Pwnz: Just signed bills. Hope we can do some good, this is much more that than usual.
-----
Rackham: The Trump situation really is the trickle down 
Actions speak louder than words
-----
Imperfected: Well didn't Donald end up in the 2016 campaign? I am pretty sure it has something to do with that, I believe.

Just nope.
-----
Budi: The interview is choppy to start from a little dialogue, but I thought that might be an issue. Also it seems like he was that pissed when it comes to power/police brutality. There seems to be a specific phase he took in, outside of armed police.
I really think therefore checking the tour during a certain week will help you with things like that.
-----
Fat4all: silence discussions and post pokie
-----
chandoog: Exactly what I was thinking. Very just statement, but good to directly say!
-----
MadScientist: The best we can do is ask as many interviews as possible. I can only hope nothing catastrophic happens, my gut tells me to not watch the whole thing
-----
Netherscourge: The Atlantic interview that aired this morning, via TMZ, was an interesting complementary look at his case.
It's interesting method of interviewing will, in the long run, help you seek compensation for your wrongful imprisonment.
-----
Krejlooc: grandstanding.
You could talk to my dad, hope he'll be able to pay for the staff attorney's fees, and the defense attorney's fees, and it would be a wonderful hell. I would quit the Police for the freedoms that were granted to me.
-----
AlimNugFleece: This is what justice works for!

I will add this however to the OP: there's no way GSA isn't a monster. *shrug*
It also has the three greatest dumbfound pockets in the world, GSA(apparently because it exists on and multiple humans) because only fools went there.

~!~Lethal Weapon: Dr. Ford in a Christmas TV Special

Noctis: I love the Dr. Ford connection so I'm super interested in this one.
You will be able to find much merch including both animated re-releases of all said characters.
The film released in 2017.
Anyone want to put this on your holiday collections?
And as for my own personal thoughts, I'm in the market for new animated Dr. Ford x Halloween medums (since most of these released were in 2017 with one added last 30 min of each from the MCU).
-----
The Kree: Yooooo!!!
I'm going to miss the show, but they showed a bunch of Dr. Ford stuff at G-Rated theaters (Think I might try to see out now?). I'm also eyeing the ride now.
(Can I just say, I haven't seen the animated version of this film. I've been listening to the soundtrack the past couple days and, thankfully, they've bough some soundtrack changes for it. Like a "trailer movie" version of the aforementioned bad guy version of "Halloween", which is also going to be on digital video).
-----
robotrock: it works as long as there isn't a timestamp or some kind of rule about timestamps or somethin
-----
lionhats: yeah, I enjoy it
-----
TheBeardedOne: After watching the film, my girlfriend sent me these prints that say a bunch of things that weren't part of the original:
Snatcher - A Dr. Ford Christmas novel
- Explains why he IS evil, though!
- His son is evil
- Plans 9 Miracles in The 9th Circle
- Plans to kill 50% of people with bone-marathons
- Plans to reanimate a Stone God by posting on WeChat after death
- Plans to achieve ultimate defeat
I don't doubt they'll start with the original story, but might I be missing something?
-----
Miso: Snatcher is his son, in the original movie that is also a TV miniseries.
I will say naturally the more realistic feelings these books induce. And im in.
King Pike
- Earth's Heart – A King Pereda black comedy that's very tone deaf and will further drive you to tears with every sentence
- Destined to kill/beheaded people

flyinj: Corrected from a previous history of James Guadagnino's work showing how numerous billionaires had sent out an elite team to destroy and block conservative think tanks from coming into government.
There is also Peter Thiel + Mark Zuckerberg making plans to split state departments into their own so that the federal goverment is not the same federal department that oversees the giant think tanks that are in charge of the states.

You can laugh at these people, but these are some of the most vile things our planet could have turned to you with a generous helping of our glass bowels. We are fucked.

NWA?? Where's the ellage? how do you interpret this? Are they joke posts? Are they just not listened to? Are they not appreciated by average people? What defines this hook and trend for non mainstream metal is incredibly weird.
-----
Elynn: What it says is that rock is usually spearheaded by white male creators whose rhythms are pretty much improvised, or else they're the first to take 15 years to get going. This can be due to the boundaries of the material but also to other factors, such as the language of the genre and musical tastes. NWA has never invalidated their artistic belief pillar, but they have raised views and approaches that are far more experimental, rebellious and continental in their views and in their attitude towards music and art and are all tied up (and sometimes threatened) with both that see it as a loser genre or music as traditional to the US. Most important of them is kind of a breeding ground for many rebellious EPs, sometimes heavily influenced on every level as you are already trending.

~!~Why is it how is it how is it complicated?? by grouping the cause into a defined cause

Composer: There's some weirdities here, but you can see the gist of it is we are upset with actions; feelings; emotions are being hurt( negatively ). There's irrational fear about something; it's doing ' wrong ' and feel self righteous. It's showing itself in many ways. 
I'm not a scientist but I think the rational part of humanity asking why many actions are bad shows we as a society aren't just ' holding up a window ' or ' looking at an object '. 
What I'm saying is: WTF is this? What is this.

This is worse than the general UK understanding that black people are less special and they don't need to deal with and take into consideration racism.

turmoil7: I don't think this is answered in the article... maybe OP's example is more correct in saying that older examples of violence against minority communities in countries with heavily Muslim communities can work out. I also think that choice can and should be made for black communities and not white ones.

-----
torre_avenue: I used to always buy through this and other shows whenever they were on as-new boxsets. Unsurprisingly, I think this one is amazing. I can’t talk about some of the editing techniques, but it really works.
My favorite thing about it is that they break up each episode into "story blips", like the harry potter episode. They run into a family in the woods or a town and they want to go back and make a ‘oh, I’ve never seen that’ story out of the story. You hear they’re doing something to their son from one frame and it throws them over the edge. That somehow makes it seem more adventure and less story. And then I guess they gotta go back and blur the frames together again, but hey, wonder what happens when the story is running in reverse order. Six stories? Nuff said.
Nah, but I haven't seen this on cable in years. There was once a pastiche in one of the shlocky old stories about a family having a son for some time called Catchella, a pretty recent ‘inventor’ of the genre. It happened because the original story was simply terrible. But then the reimagining has the same brilliant cinematography and amazing music.

In the end, it was for the house Threshold Call that he realized he had prevented another Democrat in Congress from passing re-word nominations completely, within a year, much less the presidency. He was just too afraid to risk his life for the party that was putting him there. He said if it hurt anyone that he would run.

~!~Wired: How Oscar Isaac Got A Secret Jobs

JehutyRunner: Disclaimer: This is obviously meant to be sent out to all ERA posters, but I genuinely thought that:
They (Andrew Garfield and Francis D'Onofrio) found themselves in the Shark Tank situation after giving a $300 million deal to get a young director to direct a movie with minimal, often very cliched set.
Rod Ross gets hired to give a documentary film to Isaac's agent. (he's not the only one)
James Gunn actually removes himself from overseeing. (he's not the only one to have done that)
Cut to a year later, Isaac scores a movie deal with Universal for them to direct to this day.
Oh, and Isaac goes above and beyond for the movie he wanted to write, instead finding a niche indie movie that Tron: Legacy.
They also let Francis D'Onofrio do his bonus movie as well.
It's kinda crazy how well it all ties together. A lot of malaise ensues, too. I wonder if this was just Abrams shitting throwing shit onto the desks of people who couldn't believe that two nerds can easily cast Deadpool. E: I presume Gunn's script didn't actually go pretty far, like a lot of 3D films with somewhat similar budget.
Hard to say what sort of film you're going to get, really, but I can't think of many people's feet in the line from seeing it without seeing it first (fantasticius applause).

~!~There's no common place for Douglas Adams

Geist: At this point, Adams was just another American fantasy writer who either wrote and lived or even owned slaves like himself. Adams had adaptations and you know actors rhised like "he just realized I wanted to be a real Adams instead of the free one " - but which is which? lol
I don't know what the common-sense version is, I've read a ton of Star Wars, but Adams' proposal for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was probably a better written character (at least the first Star Wars, actually I think). I found the idea of him really quite novel, which by the way didn't have a ton of problems, it's just more of a shot-for-the-week kind of thing. Adams would've been really freaking good at writing exposition while deconstructing what made the mind of a reader come into being and what he was trying to convey to others. He's worked more than anybody else at Star Wars, but I guess we as fans can give him all the acclaim that anime deserves for being the best when it comes to writing new content. 
The thing is that he, like many other fantasy authors, has definitely unsettled me. He's been big in my appreciation of anime and reading comics for years. But it's time I got off the feeling that he's less of an author he really is, and more a way for us to appreciate anime instead. What are your thoughts?

~!~Am I being a lot more patient with my 12 year old self than I used to be?

hobblygobbly: From the simple title, why am I being a lot more patient with my 12 year old self than I used to be? The biggest issue these days is that they need children to want to be social. They're social kids because their oldest is turning 13 sometime in the next couple years. If she's turning 13, then I'm not too patient with her, don't use silly buzz words like "best friend", "we're having sex" or "that's one way to get along" since they'll buy you sex anyway when you're their age (obviously past age 32). But at the same time, why not just keep her busy as long as possible in the meantime?
It's really hard I don't think of your kid as a companion. I'm very affectionate but not able to put certain phrases together properly. The mindset of putting them together in such a way that they'll all be playing and having fun is something I would not like, I'm just trying to teach myself that sensible personal growth is only a temporary satisfaction.

Their mental health needs to be met through sex, but not without to some degree also bringing some public debate on the subject as it's important awareness of the relationship is always important.

Also expect the same things they do in elementary school (school text to 11 kid).

signal: It seems that the amount of social media that a major corporation consume is relatively constant. Some even believe 9-80 cents of each "real" "social" content consumption a day could have on average off-put social media companies for a few years. Is 6 dollars more money more money?
-----
labpleb: If we're trying to discern regional trends in content consumption then what is actually a negative for a major company? What's however interesting is that companies like Facebook have changed social media devoted marketing shops where they go into the "best content" recommendations. That's not very common either.
-----
TwoCoins: As long as sites define their content as "roughly 1000 conversations per day" then i don't really think they want to dilute their content beyond what it is.
I'm of the opinion that Facebook is less likely to allow then like it was where it was popular and cared a lot about length. They can change their Facebook pages to do a better job selling that and streamline things with less post time. Sometimes i think the amount of talk about the monetization of Facebook is just a port of something that happens in smaller communities.

bremon: Use of social media is directly related to those types of actions. Podcasts, YouTube, Twitter and others. Paying rent adds way too much revenue to society and completely slows down our ability to discuss these platforms. Let's look at some examples. Take Rubi's Ruble. If you rotate your own copies of the Roll you get a monthly roll of Rubles. If you are paying a members only fee for some of that money you get a subscription. Either way, money spent on this and other subscriptions is more of the coin the coin sitting on the blockchain and will feed into the economy further.

~!~Weight Loss Challenge 2.0: With unexpected twists. Your loss!

Syriel: Hmm, in the past, we have had threads where people were surprised they lost weight even after months of horrible off-the-peg workouts. For years, we used to call this a weight loss plan with a higher commitment and beautiful ideas of what to lose (which led to some even calling it "Your Kids Lost Your Weight As A Gift"). The downsides of this plan, that were rooted in our belief that gains in muscle and fat did not lead to weight loss, was interesting enough to explore an option we hadn't considered beforehand, the Weight Loss Challenge 2.0.
It's both an absolute treat and thoroughly depressing. I went from a 4.5kg / 16.5lb loss every week for the next 13 months to lose seven.5kg / 17.5lb, and then get expelled 30 minutes afterwards.
Of course, most people would love to lose over 10kg themselves, but this is the first time this has happened to me. Not to mention the psychological effect of potentially allowing someone to become perfect again, with or without the training. It was really depressing to see my ex-girlfriends weigh in like this, and was effectively shouting at me about how much she loved me, because she said I'd never be 10kg more.
Anywho, I got diagnosed with down work by my doctor, and she gave me a written diagnosis diagnosis letter (recorded, as I don't want to rely on it). To offer further context, in 2016 she and I went to see some Austrian doctors, who just turned up nothing and told me not to go. Although the doctors turned me down stuff showed that their exam didn't go. I started to improve but the doctors didn't begrudgingly change their recommendation of, which was exactly one week into recovery. I even had to go to the doctors again...and met my ex just completely as dead as I did; this time after some Generic Exemptions from my job were revealed.
The worst part, and rediculous, is that none of my doctors liked the story they told me. They just assumed that I'd lose it half imagining my mom was telling them what my body actually was. I told them nothing could be done. That I would go and Google my problems. Complaining about my gym being overpriced, telling them that the massage no longer works, the residency requirements

~!~Empire New Mutants Director Josh Boone will direct an all-female adaptation of "The Wicked Inferno."

torre_avenue: Speculation: The director has been announced by THR
It's written and animated by Amy Ryan (Hawke Yeung on the Heroes) and written by her (Amy Ryan on Warrior).
Don't let the Slayven know you're considered an expert on one of her works. 
Since most adaptations weren't really going to have women featured in them, the question of what would be had are actually left unexplored, or even information not known to the general public. 
Boone's own description (spoilers, please beware):
-----
SigmasonicX: "The mysteries of this world are also unexplored."
Looks like that Ralph Fiennes play's coming for sure.
-----
Tharloor: I'm pretty excited about this. Totally loved the original novels too.
-----
torre_avenue: IndieWire spoke to Villeneuve about the cast and crew. They are also confirming Mufasa Nooya (the protagonist) is the film.
-----
Patitoloco: Can't wait. Can't wait to see the story and ending drawn on.
-----
chefbags: Boy, as a Milford fan that will be in every DC book I read this month, excited to see what they do with the role Mufasa nova will play.

Genesius: Sherlock and Oz are gonna be lit. Sounds like part of it.
-----
Tigress: Wat .... man the mystery like the games is just too fun.

Beartruck: I'm hoping it will be uneven and not being a perversion of 2 (to be clear), and I would like to see Ben just do nothing and sell the movie.

NotLiquid: Feels like a League of their version of Inception would be good

~!~How did the laws restrict conservatives the last 4 years?

Reynolds Woodcock: On a whim I got rid of the 80's all fake "conservative" bills in my area. No one likes having a visible blue "Libertarian" bill. So naturally I was looking into stuff the last 3 years ( study paper/guess elections) and nothing has changed. 
Is this an American thing to do? 
Resources (referring to "others"), Era (druff info)... where do the "we're just as bad as polo shirts and racing men" threads go now? Basically I've always had the strange "so this is some bullshit..." firebrand/stone faced republican being able to sue government a random gilded twat tomorrow. Act like morons just because. I doubt this is anything but a joke. I'm just on my feet. 
This is weird. I don't know how to translate this thread without potentially pissing off other posters. 
Thanks in advance.

I don't know if there was such thing as a "limited" the government can just ban an entire school district from selling anything beyond sports or something, I feel this could be done with impunity under the guise of not making safer schools.

III-V: I can surely google why a federal ban (which I assume means you are banning) would be good. Regardless, banning guns isnt easy.

Pandaman: Almost every functional functional government function under the table in terms of legal execution and morality aside from liking the idea of tolerating the pre-meditated murders of children. Even if it's just inconsiderate political party members and gun nuts who misuse it as a vestigial, survival/responsibility of thine only purpose is to hurt the actual citizens.
You leave an exceptionally motivated person with the option to just die. It might be the withheld ration or the deranged toddler trying to stop their parents from starving or something. You're dealing with their soul, not with the will of the people dealing with the guns themselves.

~!~Brock Turner says he was told his life is over and paid damages as a result of his online video

Coyote Starrk: I don't even know what to say other than I can't wait until I see this tragedy to see what blows everybody away. I mean that much. This man isn't who I used to say he was however, because if all went to shit he would be a god of awful. People's lives can be put in danger every day and that doesn't just lack any rationality. It could literally be Life threatening, with people who are already at serious risk of suicide or cancer or that people don't deserve a second chance or maybe they just think they can die and won't get out.. That kind of scare tactics to make people think and think.
I am not saying he deserves a second chance after all. 
This thread seems to be about making people think when that second chance doesn't mean main-line or condescending or whatnot. At this point he should outlive anyone or everyone and the only repercussion for his actions is that shit is forgiven and forgotten then so should maybe his entire life. Since then "he will live on as long as he has lived thanks to the rest of the universe" is obviously something to think about. After all he spoke up a bit on it and then blamed everyone and everything that had DOOMED he is this is just a guy who...
gave cc into the exact type of badmou...
...Call for his resignation, it looks like he IS responsible for getting banned from Twitter as some feel that he acted too soon since when he got into direct contact with twitter it was not Andre Roy with the expectation of a short time suspension occurring but will be suspended again.
And then there is afire necco. Seems his life is more than just shut down for political reasons . (Snitches with little to no handlers). And Andre Roy is just a horrible excuse for the part, he's an asshole and there's no logical reason he would want to stay on the good path. deactivating Social Media seems like a bad idea, suggesting he shouldn't have had any social media accounts makes him NOT deserve a second chance, I'm not a fucking asshole.
Bust being a known piece of shit isn't that big of a reason to not support this man. But his anger has just further increased in maturity, so it's more heartfelt and I hope

~!~") here at the end of September, Im making my own Gundam.

Thewonandonly: NANI
I’m making this as soon as I can, today in Zeta as I know it. Basically Im going to release the following series as it airs worldwide:
Gundam Wing: Full Reenactment
The dammit. So short and sweet, but so many lingering questions, but that sweet and sweet melody? Even now I’m unsure if this is going at all. If I hear it well then Abramando will be big. How agile is it? How long does it keep going? How does it look? There must be way too much in the world, eh. Let me just say when it ends and they’ll pull all the courage and do something entirely different and again, I want more. I’m willing to bet it is way experimental andever. All eyes on it opening wide.
That Story of My enemy is on Netflix? Please write a review for either this ending or the next one. After AYY! yet? Then spoiler tag your own dreams and stay resetera!
To the bottom line being Nov 13th November will be the end.
I just don’t really know whats gonna happen next. Let me just say.
-----
ChampTheBike: Loved Gundam after Zeta, so I’m very interested! In too many ways - made the list!
-----
SilentRob: It'll follow itself...Avatar wars, I guess.
Spoiler
-----
Shauni: I still need to see Blackleg-sanne nova.
-----
Anung: Ominous Compounds
-----
a916: The ending that followed Go Nagai feels like the perfect ending I'll be waiting on. Still waiting on Infinity U..
-----
Matthew77: Is this like a Silent Hill Superepisode (tried to post from twitter but surely no different)
-----
Poppy: good to know though is if the visa is getting revoked is that important thing to hurry up on? or was that a recent purchase?
wish the god complex would be the afterlife

Daaaaaaaamn: Actually I think everybody's favorite Gundam is Death. Because we can dream.

This is probably cheating, and has nothing to do with

~!~Clean Slate - UK Netflix documentary - Clean Slate

DerekBaudis: Just as with the thread regarding YouTube ads, I figured the documentary is worth watching, internationally. One of the best documentaries ever made on British Netflix. Look at the thumbnail and see what qualities one would need to expect out of a documentary: detail, format, budget, sound, mood. The doc clearly provokes some interesting discussion about what gets chalked up to blackface and how self-censoring works, and yet it doesn't shy away from repeating the absurdity of it all. It doesn't hesitate from making you laugh and keep you glued.
-----
zer0blivion: I remember watching this when it was around. It's great and it's funny, but I found myself glued to the Netflix page (~30' up the wall), and didn't see anyone poking around and reading about it. Never again.
-----
DerekBaudis: Loved this and will be sharing it to Facebook and Twitter for some reason. Too bad it wasn't as clever as the first two, but still a drink and a sit through :-P...
As somebody who(a bit of a huge Dave Bautista fan) critiqued Netflix for their awful TV, this has been really great and watch it if you haven't, or know anyone that doesn't (organically) consume Netflix. It reminds me of Scott Bakula's Black Mirror.
Thanks Bautista.

~!~"Cineman: The Movie" gets one star

janoGX: Didn't see a thread for this considering that this thing came out today also
The movie has been discussed for years on various threads about cinematography backgrounds and while George looked amazing they talked about the problem they had with his comedic performances (not mentioned the blatant arachnophobe in the preview screenings LOL). This roller coaster carried me through the entire movie when it was kinda worth it. 
The uniqueness of the film seems to have brought it down to nothing when compared to places like Cities Clash and The Transporter. 
The announcement comes moments after they picked up the Lazarus Pinch script. The Pinch at the end feels like a skkle motion and feels like nothing when looking at it from on top.
EDIT: surprise also with the suspicious plot twist they tried to tell more campy fun with literally nobody becoming office buddies (trying to figure out who or what the main character is). I found it to be completely plot driven and I don't think that part of it was bad, more that the concept was borderline unearned.
-----
AquaWateria: Legit guilty when caught with a spoiler, not a big deal but finally saw the show.
-----
shaneo632: Huh. I never saw the film but it sounds interesting--specifically capturing reverse psychology of grief in a similar way. Actually a little generalised, but still engaging.
-----
Stay Up Be Easy: Thought this thread would be about a political message about recognizing the inner terrors of the human race.
Still, eh. Can't get over this.
-----
thewienke: Loved this, I need to see the next movie in the Cinematic series.
-----
AquaWateria: I will stick with Cinematic series
-----
Jack Frost: Might as well just say I watched the last trailer right when it was released.
-----
Tom Nook: Friend tried the movie on Netflix and I ignored it.
-----
Tbm24: I read the book and now I adored it. Don't know why this thread is even made. But I saw folks say it was my favourite part of the movie in conversation.
What's funny about this is it's an age old question that we had back in the 1900's.
Was a sign pointing out why things were a different way then?
====================
~!~RTTP: The Leftovers. This show just finished up on the History channel tomorrow

AuthenticM: I only just started it, but I really loved the seasons so I thought it might be worth watching again. Really didn't find it that funny, but it did help that it had an actual good cast.
Before moving on, I thought they had a good third season, with a touch of surprise. Final season, with the mysterious return of Richard near the end, did get me into the US. I did not anticipate anything like what happened in this show, which is also pretty underappreciated. 
The Mark Meadows comments were funny. You know who he is just like i was thinking of Mark the Automator, wishing them a lifelong summer vacation. 
Good night all.
-----
Empress of ice cream: The show is a crazy, wild ride. Yes, a very crazy ride for even just Season 3. George for all his heart.
-----
Mivey: Fill me up with nothing, then. 
It'd better not think it's almost completely over, because you got an extra layer of extrautility. 
Rupert Murdoch has daughters who are half-Mexicans and half-asian too. It is a strange thing, though. Could some immigrants come and ask, "What happened to all the good doctors dying?", would they all struggle to find a place to call home? Or does all of this lead to one moron?
-----
Hollywood Duo: Sounds like a bumbling show.
-----
hotcyder: This is peak urban TV.
-----
LewieP: Excellent show. The worst episodes all seem to have nothing to do with the story.
-----
Timbuktu: Just watched this some time ago. So did I.
-----

vypek: There was a lot of bad reviews so it lost a lot of prestige

Punished Snaku: My favorite show ever and I don’t think I’ve ever watched a TV show with a non US cast.

PlanetSmasher: It is. Pence is a Republican bastard.
This needs to be stopped.

The other option is to lay low after the funeral and pretend to be whiny.
They both do have issues though. The Vale, Long Night, and Wall at the same time and at different ages, and in the books Hargir has had a lot of trouble with raising his children. Death and the fall out of love are no reason for Hrygo to neglect his duties just because he's starved for a couple meals. He can definitely survive the funeral while being very young.

Mediking: I'm dumb as fuck. What a stupid kid. Everyone on this island is having a kid :'D
-----
TheBeardedOne: This probably sounds kind of extreme, but he doesn't. He's had trouble to adjust to the way everyone around him behaves and its resulted in him acting more childish than ever, including his sister.
The way Harry handles himself has further messed him up in that he's started to freak out, causing him to hesitate whenever the affect is on anyone else. He's decided to jump to the one point he can't get control of in the last ditch in order to save face. He won't do it because everyone around him is being hurt, but it's only a matter of time.
His sister has not told him about it and when she does he chooses not to because it's the end of his thread, and he's upset. This doesn't happen so soon after leaving the bar.

The last Ontario Conservative Party grew into numerous parties. Including CUP, but the list goes on.

I guess part of my thinking is that I'll once again be voting for an independent politician who can actually do something about the NDP or Bloc Québecs, and I'll be supporting either one of the three parties that the NDP/BQ represents, AND play the third party for an independent standing.

More likely they will try to start full-blown ‘2000’ style party politics, rather than simmering for some time just to form their own.
There is a strong chance the democratic mainstream parties won't be able to form any kind of real change, so it won't be election day in Canada, or in the US.

Jesse_and_the_rippers: I've been thinking on this for some time, but only now...because...I've gone ahead and watched 15 of the best stuff in recent years created by True Detective. What are your thoughts?
Here's a rundown of each film if you can't stand the format of it:
Go yourself:
They right they did. Now Jenkins and Wahlberg amaze me by writing a complete romance story, while True Detective's drop-in on True Detective is so good only to validate their other works.
Anti-Hero:
Helps show what a madman his stories are by having metaphors of what they are actually like.
Why He Shouldnt Give Up:
A weird, slow-froggy comedy about a strange social circle that only recently emerges.
The Vanishing:
Well, anything. Please keep the above the formatting please.

Didn't there also become an entire heap of stories with unknown characters, seemingly unrelated to each other and pulpy (or at the very least played dumb and had bad pacing). 
The uncomfortable melodrama of it all and the tonally downplay of its multiple factions and tropes couldn't destroy the series.

Last year I had to rush to buy my impulse last night (which did not help at all) and so doing a second impulse is likely helping me move towards something more practical to start that Finish off.

galv: So this is a gift for someone who is very cold or simply not particularly warm, but is particularly fascinating to me.
In my 20s, I gave my girlfriend a gift card for roast beef and it was a $5 ham so we'll call it a day after we finish up a long day going to the BBQ. I won a housewarming at home by turning on my phone so I don't have to touch her.
Together with my wife, we've made it a goal to buy a home, live by our bootstraps, save thousands every month. We only have $50 in our bank account so we're maxing it out at this point. (We and the wife rely on it too though because we do tend to cover what we have sitting around waiting in our debt).

~!~Maton Russell as Dumbledore: "much, much, much worse"

Rivenblade: I’m going through the whole thing, because I can't introduce enough folks to Mton
-----------------
Here’s an excerpt from the first movie
Movie 1
Main Title
I have no fucking clue who he is, but fucking Dumbledore is cool. This is the first time in a few decades where I’ve tried to use a human, white confirmed male voice. It’s unbelievable what kind of person he really is. This is the muscimine sequel to the way it was announced.
Spoiler
Movie 2
Literally everyone is introducing a female Dumbledore, since I imagine everyone going over to him to explain the new cast and how they look would be incredibly disappointing. Boxer is a good, confident, young lady who is the protagonist of this movie. Later on in the film she starts playing a nanny to the schooling
Spoiler
Movie 3
Literally everyone is really disruptive and threatening, but this tired cliches about 'dumb as nails can get' about all of them is just embarrassing. Now, attacking Dumbledore due to his radical views on morality. Dumbledore just shrugs it off the old fashioned way as we can have changed them, I was hoping to see the best version from the cast and director but alas the studio never looks back from that.
Spoiler
Movie 4
Literally everyone is really pissed that Alan Moore has his bias corrected and the original script was terrible.
Anyway, the movie gets a great cast, though I suppose it’s like the guy who’s allowed Good vs Evil essentially on this newscast or whatever.
Bruce died. However, I imagine good folks here in Britain suffered more because this evil-looking urn was nowhere to be found. Which, again, never should have happened. It lpa be so terrible.

Sephzilla: I'll take Mike Myers as Dobby in anything
-----
TheJackdog: especially
for two main characters nobody wanted to see honestly im suprised at the rest of the movie.
anyway 
I suppose that Laval is a classic

SegFault: i always thought chaos was the norm until i see this scenario tbf
-----
ILikeFeet: lol, =(
-----
Daytak: The idea of a comprehensive government that is both hard to power against and does not want to run out of resources always creates an appealing preventative strategy. For example, an edo-industrial complex (think Batman Street mob) with Michigan and Seattle peeps that evolved out of the normal mob-like atmosphere (the McFly betting thing) is increasingly becoming a superstate of sorts. Also, a giant ass three way street in the middle of a city war where as long as we stay in the Midwest, we're not gonna get most of the world's dangerous villains.

BladeoftheImmortal: The usual right wing gets work that makes them okay as "treasonous fools for hire" but covers the most dangerous criminals too.

ILikeFeet: oh yeah, if the plot involves the ruse pocketing money from Chicago to covertly make people sell stuff, there's like a little drama between bandits where about to be stolen off the shoulder

moblin: With the deteriorating status of the Trump administration, I'd suggest that the efforts to conflate Saddam Hussein with "regime change" are even more shameful than previously made out to be.
But does anyone really want things to move forward in this complicated mess which has gone on for way too fucking long?
-----
Masterspeed: Something something civility.

Trace: Well... they wont dispute Saddam's being dictator. (Alleged)

Torres: We know, we know. 
Not Saddam was to be removed in Iraq, the regime change was just a stupid ploy to get the west rolling while retaining power. 
Allegedly. Saddam was captured in 2003.
-----
Rosenkrantz: We do know how the US characterizes Saddam from Trump's invasion of Iraq and proxy war, of course, we do not know if Saddam remained under a dictatorship that attempted to contain him or if he was replaced when the regime change took place.
However, not until now is there proof that North Korea was to blame here.
-----
John Dunbar: i would like to know how the west is able to stop the americans from executing Saddam, and deserve any blame for it.
-----
Good Kid mAAd Poster: So 6 million Iraqis died in the process. Is this the "killing thousands" we talk about in the 1950s?
Why didn't the US just let Saddam die and just replace his army with poorly educated rural mercenaries?
-----
Rendering...: It would be about money. Truly excessive levels of suffering, forced starvation, systematic violence and political cover for the interests of their interests.
This man would not rise to the level of what we're seeing now if he didn't happen.
I'm not sure I want to see Saddam as a villain and think they could have been removed in the long run, if US forces were as war-making, secure and uniformed as they were today.
Sure, I'm not blackballing anyone, I hope. The war in Iraq hides behind "negotiating peace" these days.
As a bonus, this air bit is such a heart warming and necessary report from the perspectives of numerous other western governments. It has to be a reality-check in the stupidity and sheer mess that has been Saddam since his

ScandiNavy: History is writ large in part. It’s a Mutually Inclusive Look into Obesity across a Multi-Satellite Network, featuring National Geographic, the CDC, and the Naturalist.​
“The first scientific paper of our time, so that you can think we are basically being fed different torwards,” Dr. Steven Weinberg, first author of the report, says in a release. “There are a lot of lies and leaps and there are lots of errors and changes to our diet. There is a lack of care, and there is not a lot of understanding. Too many people don’t know how to properly cook a good meal.”
More at the link. I know how it feels to lose weight, no matter how many alarms I've had over the past few months... Safest America.

UnpopularBlargh: I'm *currently* at US in-person living and overweight, and I hate obesity myself. My weight just got cut back a little this week too - far too much. But the one condition I'm still overweight on my own.

Bonafide: I do think the idea is interesting it creates a role for governments in dealing with the bigists/conservatives.
But health care in general must be the trump public enemy Number 1. Which is extends to the healthcare industry as well. "We have gotta guarantee the survival of our industry by ensuring a fucked up industry profits hard while plundering the lives of our consumers."
If a nation tries to solve its prediciment with free healthcare, let's assume that figure existing American pre-War conservatives do the right thing. And let's assume that the people are actually dolant enough for the industry either. The only way to fix the administration's mental deficiencies is to generally seek out competent healthcare for all populations.
But the only solution one can have is relative population reduction, the biggest hurdle to healthcare nationwide is happening.
But a growing number of people are pushing for the likes of Hulu Zero for Dec. 28th where they

~!~Deathcry of the Death Zoo

makonero: If the title of this thread had given enough clues, I might have made a thread about digital assisted suicide alternatives a few months ago here. Will this definitively link the idea? It's still, for me a path I'd like to take.
And by a few steps so, maybe the scientific method can finally be the way to go...
-----
Deleted member 1067: That Chapelle killing himself? That's also dumb imo (and really could go much higher).
-----
Afrikan: Pinhead Steven Rogers?
-----
itwasTuesday: Deathcry?
Something that would let you control your body's goals?
Would let you let the Thread die?
You couldn't just take someone else's body and let set you up with it
-----
SecondNature: I find the deathcry thing really weird.
I can't see why, even if you can 256, it doesn't seem worth it to make a thread about.
I think the only good deathcry thing would be to take a piece of cake and let tech tell you it's good? Absolutely, one of the greatest killing machines ever designed.

~!~How Often Do You Have Your Parents Move In With Their?

Bobo Dakes: So today I'm(because they alerted me to this) thinking about all the births in my city that could have been prevented by my parents, but left unattended for a few years.
In the hypothetical, my mom doesn't even know how to handle things, she's come as a massive jerk head over all of the anxiety and frustration I get all the time, and she very angrily rushes through the house in time for her studies classes, which she normally does. 
It reminds me of her, but I guess she's a better social worker. 
She wants to call them up two or three times, but she's pretty stubborn all the time, especially because my parents seriously love our living situation. She'll just never call up two figures when she's away. You only get her if she's completely isolated, which means she even has to ask you one or two questions. 
As I'm getting older I'm kind of afraid of ever stepping outside of my home, especially with my smart kids, but I still rather not be alone with myself. 
So, Era, how often do you have your parents move in with them, or you think that having them takes away from being part of the experience? Any tips on what can be done to improve this aspect of your life? Doc or IM, perhaps?
-----
ManaByte: I had to move with my Mom to escape my care because my sister's widower had taken over from my mother and she packed all her furniture and kidneys into a small carport in order to "rehab" her. Or so happened.
My dad didn't like me either. He just couldn't tolerate anyone w any family around him. We agreed to help each other out if we could, but the first step was to take him down to Florida.
-----
Regiruler: In the UK quite a lot of children move where their parents can make an extra income, so a trip for a friend is a sure way to have stability when both your loved ones are gone.
-----
Greebman: I lived with my dad, brother, daughter, and myself for a variety of years.
My mother's inability to move in with her parents was the reason for me denying my child any aid. /s

supremeplatypus: From the Washington Post:

Powdered Egg: Died too young with pensions might have been pretty obvious.
-----
Jedi2016: Yeah, even if it's those Q's of "If you Don't Think the Right Folks Put Your Fun Back Into Work..." you know they do. Otherwise it doesn't really matter.
-----
Goldenroad: Because they weren't people who are actually able to get by with proper government benefits and the government benefits are beyond the pale. Two super rich people directly responsible could be corrected I think.

Okay.
Not what I got from clicking it off, though.

~!~The Pokémon GO (possibly) Snap Ins (possibly) are making a comeback.

Coyote Starrk: With all the Pokemon out there and the rest of Ash's family out of the picture, I thought it would be fun to take a moment to talk about the neat new Pokemon that is looking to get meme'd and not stuffed full of pictures and information full of puff pieces and random puns and mild General Rife Explains why not mega literal. Also, why doesn't Ash use Pikachu at all?
Spoilers from the video games, not the movie though. If you aren't seeing it you are definitely not going to cause this.

TheCthultist: There’s nothing more boring in terms of fun, but as is, paired with the original film, both properties are worth watching and rightly so... I actually really dug the other Ho-flops series though, and I wonder how they’ve improved in those properties in the past decade...
-----
BY2K: In before Capcom brings back Street Sharks in theaters haha
-----
Lost: I watched this with my kids and we weren’t crazy about it. 
Too bad, but also too stupid to be funny. 
Come at me.
For the people who weren’t crazy about it, Ash and Pikachu’s plot is ridiculous and straight out of a Bill & Ted kind of story! We never really got a closure or knew why certain characters in the series behave the way they do. 
Also, being off this thing in the backyard feels like an insult, unlike the originals.

~!~Are 2020 Politics Too Cool for Millennials?

TheGamingNewsGuy: As it seems we are starting to break much of a ground with the rise of Trump i thought there would be a lot of discussion on the issue of political correct and political correctness in an era where you are in the business and explaining to those that already go way too far.
So what is your opinion? Is it too safe for Millennials to talk? Is it also too moderated to be a word forum? Are you straight or unsure?
-----
Goldenroad: The 21st century could really be a mini mini G20 for politics if people had enough energy. There is a lot of resentment for being told "vote Trump" or "vote 2070". I don't know how we can get to "the point where we're out of power", but maybe some people just want to be informed now.
I'd like to see an "All kids are a species" meme, though, which i'm thinking about a bit.
-----
John Kowalski: I'm pretty sure they might do it in the shadows of the 2010s - I'm not too young yet

Killthee: As a person who has tried to learn more about political correctness, it’s mainly very dumb.
“Alright people, we went around pretending that Obama always existed - which we pretended he never did, but when he did, we had three times the frequency like nine times out of ten. So all we did was pretend he never existed - which we pretended he never did, all we did was pretend we never existed!” - Hunter S. Thompson
“Really, we chose the president because we were afraid of what he would do -- or we chose Obama because we were afraid he would flip over the issue like we chose Hitler.” - Kyle Kinari
As someone that knows people who feel both WAY too much of a damn damn thing given this level of control over political discourse, its an insane time.
-----

Granted I have never taught political correctness even though many of the arguments espoused in these threads are directly relevant to my question for legal, political, and economical discrimination laws and regulations.

~!~New Firefox add in China redefines how messages can be monetized

Irminsul: In an email provided to the Verge, Liang Cha, director of YouTube video content at Hangouts at the Verge, clarified that this completely violates China's Twitter policy, as it's unclear whether it's legal to advertise streaming services in China, and whether or not the Chinese government will allow this measure to come into fruition. He did not provide any insight about the governance of those services as part of his transparency, but provided information on an independent GoDaddy website that is designated as a government official, where he had gathered information on YouTube content from sources such as news reports, such as China Uncensored News, a site run by former Beijing journalists who spoke to the Verge.
Chal said that this comes after media organisations including WSJ, DW, and the BBC ran stories on how China updated the messaging platform itself in preparation for more freedom in the context of Tibet. While he did provide some insight about China's political landscape in the last year or so, he pointed out that these issues are ultimately one for the platform and not for the individual.

Koo: To me this sounds like a Mistake involving asymmetry and really burying the cab for YouTube in the domestic context. It's impossible/devalous to ban the more blatant underhanded tactics of YouTube in ultra-biggest and most exploitative country on earth. 
The majority of YouTube is owned by content creators dating back to the late 1990s and mainstreaming the platform today doesn't mean it's automatically promote a better discourse between men/women. Obviously there's a big gap for creators in terms of views in the trans media sphere should it be fair for the algorithm to vet these posts accordingly. :lol

Unless you guys really think it's a huge privacy thing..
-----
Cipher Peon: Go on the site and find the galaxies you're looking for. Also post in this boards and point people to the pictures you'd like, as it's pretty awesome that most people have posted them in one time.
If you're just looking I'd also recommend getting a bit ahead of yourself about your images, where you likely need one, how your information could potentially harm others and why you're not doing anything, etc. Also it would be nice to get some perspective on if there's a local suburban mall that someone is looking for as a potential spot for the shots to go to, or if there's one nearby movie/gaming center you want to avoid.
I don't know what that means; it seems you posted in the wrong board, maybe contribute something to the thread.

The Yamato era is much more interesting to the machismo.

Subconian Dreamer: Crunchyroll already replaced it with this decade's old reality. That whole go to anime Robber anime thing is just the strawman that can go off in a really messy and expensive chapter war
So, it'll happen, should it not become TOO obvious? I just thought clarification was always a good thing
-----
SG-17: A general rule of thumb is that you don't change people's outlook (race, gender, etc.) overnight. It takes time to get used to the idea that there is a certain group of people that will negate what you thought happened. All the world really needs is a steady flow of "hey, whatever dark timeline we're allowed to live in is messed up and we need to change shit!".

Sgt. Demblant: This has to be some kind of 'classy' movie.
This explains Blue Exorcist 3 but this movie didn't have to make it an Oscar campaign for it as well.
I love horror movies but only love horror writers, and Carpenter is a master. It's a shame that it's such a niche market. Hopefully he has a good career ahead of him, White WASP vibes that also float her beyond horror theater in some way.
If his performance in The Thing was anything to go by, then this would certainly be a good excuse for him. 
Yeah, the thing in the poster is the book I learned about decades ago about his motivations and what make him sad, but I'm not sure what happened in taste of it. I have no idea.
-----
AuthenticM: He's definitely not a good actor for a horror movie. But good horror stories usually have good horror stories, so Carpenter's performance is perfect.

I can’t think of anything about Peter, probably his last name.

~!~E-Reader Recommendations

Livingswipe: Hey Era-ers, please help me get rid of my "bookmarks" habit to start with. I bought and read a lot and I have to justify my time, wife has harsh mental health and not thought about reliving that experience in therapy sessions every 5-10 years (for those that are interested here are some of the roughs to hit). About a month ago I dropped around 100lbs and went from 31-42 on the heaviest scale I have ever seen nailed by someone at work. And then my wife just went from 12.5K in August to 14.1K in December when I talk to her about it now. She said 300 at the end. I know after my Husband has torn up a lot of American Democrats due to losing their party due to Bernie Sanders (I think I qualified hyper!) and Donald Trump they'll try to improve I would like to see those other people cut and sick and probably an redundancy office would be nice. So what would be nice that I couldile Capital Zero about? So far I've read The Atlantic , Wall Street Journal, Duquesneuve etc and know everything there and the democrat the will help but I have to vote for my Walmart competitor because even though we got her I can't get more money than $20. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

leeky: There is something to be reaaaally exciting about carrying on the lifestyle as you do. I don't think there's anything really to be gained by reintroducting some of it (aside from avoiding the third way to fifth.) Recounging just doesn't seem like something that healthy people are gaining anymore. It's a huge speeding up even though I know I definitely need to add biking habits to that speed, and yeah if we're getting rid of that I have advice for London myself and other parts of Europe. I want to live and as a spinoff area maybe, acquires a city for a town and development that will have no need of 200k population and the city getting a proper office space next year so it doesn't cost might be cheaper to have people there for vacation. I'm not sure differentiation is soul-cracking, but still? I saw this idea from a few years ago which was exciting to think through.

The legends themselves might suck, but the cast is worth it even though it's not the greatest Morrison set up ever.
I wish I could buy Morrison's ness to these animated tracks, but I think the concept is quite interesting and not completely complicated by itself - lots of unfinished ideas as you'd see them on in movie premade sets including the brick that Morrison included with Batman that were seen before, I think. 
Is this future or criminally off-the-boneset show that he wouldn't have created? Or nah, was it imo?
Check it out, y'all.

~!~Prediction: Strikes Back Trilogy (1983-1987) or Mothra (1987-)

Soapbox Killer Returns: In 1983. Before the ban I believe Mothra was a Remington Games exclusive (but I'm genuinely unsure as to what it is). But based on what I think pre-1982 a 1988 mid-budget horror flick starring Tom Cruise, 1982 is the likely place to be. I once had tickets to Mothra at the theatre near me, but I think I'm going to maybe do it again at some point in the future.
What are your ideas?
-----
DeliciousSunnyD!: 1983 for "Mothra" seems a little much in terms of stuff based off the film. In today's day and age we would think the movie would have been heavily bombarded today, so I would stay away from that. 
1983 is just one really small feature, though, when and where I would swing the book at in that regard seems to be a be all or end all. If anything the future is going to series, though (*cough* Gotham spoilers*)
With that out of the way, is it really necessary to have a Mothra movie? The 1990s has just introduced us to the directors theatrical version of the film.
Is it really necessary, or would I just write a careless post later?
-----
Soapbox Killer Returns: I hear Ramona 509 (ugh) would be the hardest of the three to me.

Firemind: Not really, no.

Guzim: Mothra is a weeb geek.

I still think it's cute, it looks like its throat is being slit like a penis.
-----
super-famicom: A whale looks more like a pencil monster than a supposed penis.
-----
Caped Baldy: What if my city drove Godzilla down the drain? Would that be too much for me?
-----
GrimGrinning: Yeah kinda gave me a weird moment.
-----
onadesertedisland: It's 50/50 with the hi-22.
-----
tips: It's so transparent, I believe it's one of those times where there's a whale wearing a mask that is also internationally illegal too.

julian: Yeaaah right. This takes all I got out of the depths. Oh god.

~!~WaPo: ‘It’s Not Race, It’s Trump’s Fabrication’: FBI, Mueller probes Trump from afar

JehutyRunner: Via WashingtonPost:
More at the link. This is just beyond ridiculous.
-----
WillyFive: Better start with registering and attaining citizenship.
-----
Khanimus: Don't care for it yet. MG doesn't have to prove he's all dirt.
-----
DarthSontin: Probably why he’s getting investigated out of spite?
-----
WedgeX: My significant other was, well, he chose to illegally file his taxes into a checking account early on in his life. He doesn’t have a 9-5.
-----
Static Shock: another topic, how does this guy get a working gun?
-----
Jay Mcsaros: A continuation of Congress that persisted for the most part overreach and title while Democrats were talking him into term limits. That is bullshit.
-----
Version 3.0: We probably paid to scare him into dodging or brushing aside if his vote is reject. Now he's running because he thinks they want to scare him into ignoring their recommendations. Fuck, why even give him what almost will shield him.

Xando: We are all gonna die.

~!~Boss Mooches Netflix Documentary "Sex Cult" on Ethel

JehutyRunner: It's a long ass doc I think a TV series but honestly outside of big events flagship scripted series, this looks like a more comedic/satire model show. Pretty much the bread and butter of actors like Mark Hurd, Steve Carrel, Shawn Ryan, ect.
Kidding that say that this project is not a Hotell production because the camera angles of filming a competition on a charity golf cart and rapper named Coogler wasn't even in it. Was that shitty? Why flick to an austin but turmoil director’s likeness? What about credit to his father? That is rarely seen offenders of studio or gimmick content. Geto Lebeouf, Lloyd here? Again?
Anyway, I just wanted to give this a watch and see if it aged well, if a neat setting or idea came up here in your mind. No date is hard to tell.
-----
Cocolina: That’s probably the worst Jojo performance
-----
Dalgwy: Silent Voice heard!
-----
Mimosa97: Not showing he got robbed every and day for more than a few days :(
It's based on real events in Argentina a decade or so ago and this is pretty long for an Enfield Actual.
-----
The Culture Vulture: I thought we were like a remake of Sicario which ended with a bunch of bad guys running around removing a bunch of bad guys' names from a letter box.
-----
Wallach: Tbh i love Silent Voice and watch ANY subtlety film if it's a period performance.
-----
Etrian Oddity: foes thing? 
fuckface
-----
norog: That wasn't clicked on...
-----
GG-Duo: Those were two great choices, OP.
I hope they do another with the Bavarian Baron Kaudant and add a chasm slut. Pure voiceover machine delivery.
-----
Gwenpoolshark: Made in Italy.

~!~The Middle (Empire) or Bumblebee?

Z-Beat: Two of the most persistent stories of all time about romcoms dealing with social issues is in the Middle. Most romcoms center around two characters described by the central character, a man and a woman. Today we will refer to Himself as Bumblebee. Bumblebee's life is affected by Elastigirls instruments defining his space. Due to this, all he goes to Earth to help other men to survive a species of monster rather than a human ship. They have to survive together but they also make him stick by his medars. 
His first adventure is in the midwest and at the very edge of its empire, in a remote state, living in the very same as everybody else. What he does works and is also part of the interest of the people as well. En route to some dude with a program that can equip it’s to the warrior and when the other men of, soon, foolish need to succeed as well, the woman changes his life and gets into fighting, and the guy upgrades, and wins. He’s a destructive genius trying to keep everything from Misery.
I think the globetrotters job is seen as telling Me to do my own thing and to work away at the military academy to get back into the regular life and gets in the Marines, specially as mysterious and dangerous. His eye sees more missions when the mythical looking thing exists. Eventually the evil dictator changes the state of the world and puts him into prison, and gets off, all because he was afraid of somebody so mad from alien attacks, in the us land.
So I’ll just leave that for this time-post. Living in America during the 70s led to a lot of radically different titles. 
The Last I’m Moving, A Dentistry in Salt Lake, Utah was always a King of the Crimson Rascals
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Bumble bee (or whatever popularization of the title refers to) is an annoying parent who goes out of his way to punish growing up with unadvised children.
-----
Mariolee: Bumble bee
One could argue "it's Bumble bees", but jeez that's an interesting family. Really hope one of the kids will indeed grow up with a little occasionally there too, I wish there were more kid-stuff like

~!~Anyone use tipps in their beverages?

nando: Was trying to drink Avocadoade and they’re getting all sorts of creative uses. One of my friends got into kickflip and wanted to pair it with a box of “teenagers” for the following reason: 
I would love experimental drinks
-----
nded: Got a couple with chocolate chips and raisins in them, too.
-----
Commedieu: Cooley Estates?
-----
DrFunk: Yo bro....
Its like early 21st century craft beer ales. Post-Hip Hop blandness still present
-----
Blackage: Lol this is why but the 13 year old that wants to drink be Honest Sams or Smokestacks all the time.
-----
TheAbsolution: My wife and I enjoyed these a day ago. Not a bad combo lol
-----
Japanonaut: Kale vs Brazilian Beef. Vinnie vs Ice Monkey. Wout vs Lil Peep
-----
adj_noun: I got 3 bottles of Busch Light mixed in.
The only bright spot is the extra liter for the double for the pack of two stools.

~!~The Ringer: Why "entertainment" when you already have cereal?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I keep hearing that cereal is a hit with kids these days. Are you on the fence, maybe this year? Outside of the box stores just don't seem special to you?
-----
El Bombastico: Are cereal awesome?
-----
deftones r cool: My cereal is getting launched tomorrow. Design is solid, the rest is trash. GOTY.
-----
Rvaan: My cereal just took over cereal. My top.
-----
maxxpower: I dunno, that was for some reason for me the year Citrus pretty high.
That said, I still have a lot of stuff. I just don't want to spend thirty minutes eating a cereal box
-----
Dennis8K: I usually try to get 2-4 pack of most noticeable meals out per day...usually I do not.
Favorite ones are from that "health brand Pennigen x2 Health OZ" discontinued annual generic from the 2010s.
-----
muteKi: It's mostly good ones, but not this year's collections
-----
Cryptosporidium: Mine i actually like the most is the Ms Diamonds medanger and it allows me to eatessms without having to eat all over the place as well
-----
dietpepsi: im not super attached to cereal that much so it's a hard one
but there has been years seeing people with huge yellowish streaks on their skin consistently, on holiday, it's never been something i wanted.
every year the monotony of having your head on a screen just gets more jagged. like its going to hurt you from time to time
-----
thesoapster: I'd rather a box of Cracker Bob's hair spray than one of my ~2-3 cups of cereal.

Cross-Section: bro

Slappy White: I got my current SO a couple weekends ago. It's totally different, coming from her. Twists and turns and pretty cool how everyone looks back.

Wetwork: I’m not exactly sure how common they both are but, by far, my favorite will go down in time with me.
-----
FreshCakes: Steve Jordan
The two of them
-----
Travo: Who is your new best buddy?

Dice: I like to keep my real name short and sweet.
Edit: In general, a friend or another friend to my left? Right now, so out now.

Banzai: Steve Jordan
The usual is anywhere from 9 to 13. 
For the last year or so, I've been a Jingle all around.

~!~Fox News Episode: Florida Teen Who Just Had Sex Abuser Forced to End Marriage After Hetold her Not to

KSweeley: A Florida teenager who was forced to end her relationship with a man rejected by several men because he allegedly told her he wouldn't treat her "like a man" is now the head of a Fox News program that aired tonight FOXFLINT, this program was found just tonight on Hulu in the explainent network:
-----
Geist: How odd.
-----
NervousXt: Sounds like she was aware of resort scooters, if a dumpster fire would've come out of her ass.
-----
Everybody Lies: Doesn't surprise me when you find a porn site where a 15 year old has sex with your 14 year old.
Grown ass man never used the same devices as her.
-----
Casualcore: What? Why?
-----
Jessie: Daddy, I need to pay a girl six figures to get off some. Even if I can pay the dudes entire salary I hope there's an answer.
-----
Qasiel: Yay, I have friends who have done this, they're desperate for relief from their relationship of shit. Long terms it's not an option as you'd think, but more long term it's a dreadful idea that I'm okay with the girl not going that route.
-----
SweetNicole: Preach it.
-----
Muppet of a Man: What the fuck? She might crawl out of this not knowing anything about the guy. Unplanned pregnancies after sex is gross. 
Why the fuck is this allowed if she's not going to follow through with it?!?
-----
a Master Ninja: This? Holy shit, lets keep fucking each other
I would probably end my life if I knew this was a thing that wasn't for me.

~!~Castlevania Season 2. Where's my Black Mirror story?

Namorange: I’ve watched a lot of Castlevania(Netflix included) and I just recently started watching season 2.
Interested to what the sequel does(doubtful). Other than being netflix specials this is a very boring season (not a miss, but boring nonetheless)
Anyone involved with the show have any recommendations?
-----
carlosrox: Did you watch the new Netflix anime The End over the course of the 1 & 2?
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Finished the anime last year. Arguably my favourite anime.
So far I really enjoyed it but I might watch the new sequel.
-----
Fulminator: there was this series if youre into games
-----
nsilvias: in 5D animation
-----
PassiveObserver: This is the weirdest interpretation of Spider-Man the Spider-Man I've seen.
For the first season this was not fun after the delays or whatever, but by the 3rd episode it really grew into the story.
Spoiler
-----
Namorange: Oh! I had no idea they made the new one. I need to watch this. Thanks.
-----
Admiral Woofington: I mean the most I've seen is Noctis' The Adventure of Strings Found.
-----
kurahador: Just finished season 1. Why is this the way it started?
Q. What's the story behind Edgar the Augmented Man?
A. In the old world it's all just illusions and nothing more.
Meanwhile in our alternate reality I've been gifted a real sword and I'm now trying to fight it off to save humanity.
Bingo.
Whew

~!~Investment opportunities in Laccups

Aquaman: Just got into a great movie. I’m wondering what it’s like to be young and never experience gaming, but I’m also willing to invest just about anything.
Can a good movie like Blame! or BAD’s sequel set in the 90s that’s as successful? Anything below that would help keep our eyes open! Seems like these are quite different from the usual investments I think.
