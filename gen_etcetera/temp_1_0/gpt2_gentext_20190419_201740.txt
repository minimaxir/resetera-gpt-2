~!~Senior Adult Avengers, Off-Topic Can't-Spoilers: Why The Last Avenger was so bad

Slayven: It has been bad the last few weeks with threads questioning whynt they exist or Cernovich being hamstrung with threads demanding proof and why everyone associated with Thor wasn't linked to the shithead that he thought was named after. This isn't about the The Winter Soldier or any other controversy-level shit, just completely bad. 
The other time Thor was defeated by Hulk, Cap and Hawkeye, he had pretty uncontroversial anti-Ultraman and Tony ruined Iron Man's day. Just utterly lame.
Compare that time Iron Man saved Cap somehow-period. Instead we have the recently announced Captain America Paris Kill (apparently as an Origin story retconned) and Robocop and it too could be taken Mod edit for full 180's on the morality of Tony.
Pick one, have they actually been bad?
-----
Z-Beat: Ooh, so Captain marvel was what we were gonna make of Captain Marvel eventually. They're just not the biggest threat in almost every way
-----
Soj: Worst.
Best.
-----
Avengers: Bob Ross was clearly one of the culprits in a long list of issues that screwed over the whole franchise, and they were all the last straw for those beginning to get even frustrated with that.
-----
Sephzilla: They thought Thanos was the first line of dialogue from the film.
Which they did in fact think Thor was the message and the end credits introduced that they were mixing it up. Except Ragnarok had the Guardians. The whole Ragnarok arc was basically just a weird twist.
-----
skeptem: Basic agnosticism.
-----
ManaByte: Their latest line was more like "yeah captain marvel isn't the first fight in every movie", and introduced Captain Marvel was just about Thor puzzling about Asgard with Thor. The point is it introduces characters that are so white their thronian heritage is not racist. It only til nostalgia gets in the way of conversation.
-----
BlackFyre: Really you think the earlier Thor 2 films are offensive?
-----
Soj: Gotta love embracing new lines of dialogue first instead of bringing it back like so many entertainment mediums.
-----
bjork: I was talking to someone on here about it, I am so sorry. It

~!~Marvel Studios CEO Feige: DC will "watch Watchmen on Netflix shit the bed"

Star-Lord: Well also get a solo movie, before and after Civil war I guess.
-----
HStallion: DC on continuity
-----
Pai Pai Master: Man I wish there were MORE marvel films that could sort those out...
-----
Dardan Sandiego: Hopefully comicbros orders will give Marvel 2 streaming services in the near future. A streaming service that starts from Netflix is a very bad prognosis.
(I know Netflix's betas are at a bad level anyways)
-----
HP_Wuvcraft: That would require a LOT of professional development by Marvel that I would want to see at this point. Again I'd love to see a non superhero film made without anyone being involved at any level of leadership having connections.
-----
Pilgrimzero: So NBC can have those superhero movies on Netflix?
-----
John Doe: This is going to make more Snyder than Batman
-----
mreddie: Not surprising it's positive for the MCU huh?
-----
Pindicator: There isn’t much that these movies can do on Netflix outside of Great Britain. You also have Captain Marvel on Hulu.
-----
BDS: I'm actually thinking about Captain Marvel starting a DC movie. Will I be able to watch it then? Will it be “9 with six months of scheduling between release and release?”

~!~Steven Soderbergh's "Transmission" coming to Netflix July 2


TAJ: I didn't even know this was the first "cinematic horror" project that Soderbergh put out after the recent Warcraft movie.

wongz: Why you gotta hate the internet as a whole? it's easy to be a troll and be a Gish-lite (and more the Gish version of it admittedly) but hate the internet? Like fuck it. And it's actually fucking Lovecraft at his best, that shit.
-----
Koo: This is no fucking horror. There is nothing shocking about it. Nothing shocking on any level. Nothing up to 90% horror. Not even Castlevania.
-----
Yonafunu: As a horror fan I want this to be a fucking B movie and I want it to be good...
Or it can't better it up it's own self.
-----
Jon Carter: If the first person I watch has vaguely been into this stuff, I’ll give it a shot.
-----
sphagnum: I'm still waiting for Project Mayhem in a few years.

Ned: The same kind of scare that came out a couple years ago is going to come out in 2019-- just release it in a few weeks.
Aside from the fact that I'm so used to the reason "Occasionally weird things happen in my life that should be under the art, but not nearly often enough that I have made the easier process of deconstructing them myself" and I don't mind that it was a temporary thing, "because" as an adult I knew the link to that learned psychadelics a good deal from his addiction story in Uncharted 4 and it scared me, even personalally, but it's fun when its an actual little reality for the sake of fun.
-----
Valkerion: I thought this story was awful from the trailer, this sounds are it. More likely a journalist because how weird are you going to be? Or is it story 1 level above more scary?

Atraveller: A water festering plague? Such an incredible mystery of our universe... I am as tense as I am off...

~!~Calgary kills groundbreaking medical milestone FDA approval for ‘therapy’

FriskyCanuck: What could go wrong?
Yes, this sounds like a case for the coming death of the human soul.
-----
shnurgleton: Talk about crass
-----
killerrin: Truly bizarre and appalling that not only this but also medicine at all, the whole wonderful way that sounds so right wing. I suppose it could be because the voices in charge sometimes lean left but I guess it's symbolic of the need to treat mental health issues. More often than not, what happened to getting to a better understanding of complex, and hence complex issues, is due to a moral and ethical perspective rather than a slight disease or want. Or maybe because it's not as intuitively related to how mono would interact with thought control on the other end. God fucking damned technologies combined with clients to bring down humanity. Crazy shit.
-----
Necromanti: Somehow it's impossible to know what the opposite experience is missing.
Well, look at the combination of an addictive habit and well-meaning ex-girlfriend/former co-workers -- more than one to give you a basic idea of the brain's hierarchy and just dominant affect, respectively. And then there's the brain's ability to flavor oppressive commie ways of thinking. I just cannot get over seeing my friends drool on my screen when I tell them we're gonna have a baby in The Hangover movies. I can't bring myself to admit I'm picturing roommates with kids in My Bloody Commie, because the be-eggnast situation -- as well as, physical health -- twists on the entire psychological experience. The underlying joke about putting the good doctor into a trance -- the good doctor wants to be a crowed-like cipher of evil that can only exist as long as he is in the room with them. Dunno why that is so funny to me.
But this little Newcastle episode of Letter Down does a pretty good job of bringing all old traumatic memories back to life:

FriskyCanuck: Now someone please explain to me the definition of "therapy" in relation to modern inter-generational trust?

~!~Movies You Hate

Andrew Korenchkin: All the movies I enjoy, I’ll add to the OP:
I'll try to be open to other movies. It never feels like a game in terms of sequels and franchises.
Consider me as a diehard anime fan. Just curious what ERA hates about movies titled “Please don’t fuck” or “Because I love the movies”. It is some obnoxious, even irrational way of categorizing favorite movies.
To be fair, I’ve been following the massive, nix the band last year since that has taken over the theaters near me, but I really, really wish I didn’t watch films I disliked. So what though? Are we just a couple of trolls?
-----
B-Dubs: Fight Club is something I completely hate.
The acting, the characters, the dialogue. I don't know.
-----
HeavenlyOne: Slenderman is a masterpiece, I like the creature himself, it's very good. I loved the final train wreck, it's not like it was a disaster; it's just a complete mess.
-----
Daytak: Walk the Wikipedia page is sad
-----
NinjaScooter: MBV (MiM, no pun intended)
In The Mood for Love is an absolute nightmare, I hate both Dances with Wolves and A Live Duel
-----
weekev: Yeah I have really enjoyed the message boards of The Last Jedi. Tons of classics that are no longer a secret and one that should help unpack what went on in the universe. Has some classics that still stand.
-----
Deleted member 11262: Ironically enough my age group - teenage, old, and women's I know most intimately hate Fight Club because the acting is fucking awful.
We're just a little sample of the arthouse/film world/whatever awfulness that's taken so long to get around to discussing? It's been a while....
But fuck the exploitation afterits been too long, the idea that movies are lesser versions of higher daddies, others are just.unskeletimes. Jalks is great too.

Andrew Korenchkin: Man. There's no point in trying to empathize with someone who only hates the movies they hate. It fucking spits out all it's's lust over again.

Steeped in a Sea of Games: So if the winner, aka the one who serves his purpose, dies, these will all be forgotten and forgotten and laughed upon further re-renderings.

~!~Why doesn't the average price of new glasses include the advertised price of the glasses?

Deleted member 1378: This is more of a question of if there's a decent selection of new glasses if the average price includes all the significant extra features/surround sound and such, but this is me asking if there's a Newvisor that in the average stereo blu-ray format doesn't include surround sound? And like, glasses have the switch to full or extra, I assume without more significant surround sound?
This is more of a question of if we can price only in per square inch, and if the rest of the price include the surround sound, on the insistence of any sales people that are somehow the only ones that get the added features their glasses allow to use.
And the answer is obviously Newvisor, but they still haven't listed it in their box and their physical media doesn't include all of them. I'm puzzled... but it's like waiting for a nice looking television... and Bluetooth headphones specifically.
-----
Birdseye: Because it's not real sight
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Needs an after feature. I can't get the appeal of glasses in my eyes.
-----
AlsoZ: 999 more dollars to spend. :(
-----
Cocolina: It aint a box. It's not a square inch.
-----
Sankt Ra: technically it’s a square by definition. But if what area your buying blinds and blinds on includes in a stereo, where is the the 909 box to go?
-----
LinkStrikesBack: Welp it's over, missed the point of my first thought.
-----
Kevers: People actually aren't going to credit the price of a new new pair of glasses to the advertised price of the glasses. That means the glasses are only available for the advertised price.
-----
Alcotholic: How do women w/toys like the McGraw Man have sex without wires?
-----
Cocolina: Its a backward price-fix. A $19.5k Chromatic Aberini kit is only available as part of a $31.5k purchase
For me, since this complaint about hoops, fits, and outlets is anecdotal/bizarre/manufactured-for-the-ways appeal, i'm wondering if we're actually intentionally trying to stonewall or wag

~!~How come Lady Gaga is not considered a public figure of her brand in her songs

Chrome Hyena: So its not really a question at all simply by nature of being a social media celebrity that this expectation of fame or power for a time be it designed or instigated by anyone else. It must just be from above, it definitely requires your consent.. Really, Lady Gaga is known to have tweeted about Tomi Lahren
-----
Posty McPostface: Dee has a Twitter account, has tweeted ~17k tweets
And then its like catfish marketing and is vouching for somebody bigger than a kid
-----
Slime: Haters of this artist, posting images of your every day in tight detail, sharing hisart/artist's works from histub.
Kinda cut from my childhood, only one tweet recently
-----
John Kowalski: I dunno man. It's getting tiring hearing of Tomi and other Del Shannon and Tim shows..
Honestly like on Lady Gaga's stuff she feels like she has every right, and him being with her in the same capacity is healthy.
But like naw they were real
Am I going crazy or did I just not like their voices

~!~Selling some Juneau themes to a friend

Thewonandonly: Sitting here crafting a thread is painful. I'm writing to upload some criterion posters for the upcoming Halloween season. Each theme and thread will be roughly divided into 3 of these themes but I'll touch on a few specifics ones in a bit. It's whatever I'm told about the themes SPOILER WARNING: they will be in spoilers. There was a chance I may have been posting them too early in the conversation and thus may have gone off on my schedule. Hope me and the rest of these mods can just tear through them.
Basically these are spoilers for the new season of Juneau. I'll be using a template for each themes in the 3rd thread. Feel free to post the ones you want everyone to pick from there. Also please free return/scrutina links if it is the same ones adress I am using. If I don't get it and feel like getting bad points elsewhere in the thread just drop it here and lock the thread if you care about getting bad points. If in case you feel like I'm malleasting some of the more gorgeous themes or if you're just liking the names in case you dislike them personally feel free to close the thread and full in thread. THANKS to everyone who plays the piano while being stuffed full of posters.
I'll be collecting each theme in the lieutenant room at the last possible moment.
I raise my arms in a corp flag at two absolutely hideous posters.

~!~How do I know if I'm getting a flu?

The perfect age: Recently I've been catching up on school work and now I'm getting the flu. I did some minor weight lifting yesterday and it seemed to be getting under controlled but I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable. I haven't had breakfast in days and then traveled to do some stretching yesterday...
Couple of days ago, I ate super unsweet since I ate so much strawberry morning meal with bananas. I thought something might go wrong or something, then I was sick for a few days and the worst I got was a sore throat, so I ate less. But today was a different story :(
It's starting to snow some and it looked like it might have mostly been in the evening. Luckily I didn't get too sick and nothing confirmed that there actually wasn't a problem... Now I have a bit of an infection which I'm trying to treat at this point but hoping for the best but I'm afraid and the actual flu has sickened more than I can say it's lifted me out of the narrow minded upbeat mood I had a few weeks ago.
I'm spending two weeks away from home and I can't ask for any advice or anything other than I don't want to ruin my life with my own personal issues but if someone has watched my pics and told me they have a virus I would like them to take steps to prevent another one (since IV's are usually necessary).

Rassilon: Camphor?
Unwise choice of area but fun to carry around a little or often depending on your personal situation I've used to be (unstable). Do not eat too much.

-----
The perfect mother: This has been my experience, I just keep drinking lots of water and feeling like a complete new person living vicariously through others to try and reach the highest highs that they really want. Lucky is that about a week after the 7th week I spend most of my week in the post office and my 4th week I spend most of my week playing videogames

Nothing Loud: Do anything to fight the urge to panic.
Self care can literally keep me out of the worst situations that have come to be. I used to have instant panic attacks and nightmares in my teens as a kid because my parents were actually controlling my life.

~!~Reviews for Nicholas Hoult's WAKANNAIN 3 (Weekly Best Picture)

Scullibundo: Dave Bautista, Cinderex et al have amazing discographies, we should keep all of this updated.
-----
Daffy Duck: I found the movie quite uninspired, and Penaissance was very hit or miss visually. Not my kind of film, but a little eh as a story. Five women gets acclimated and .... Written Wrong!!? Nothing in the theatre is overly hit or miss.
But all suggestions I should tak
I'm always gonna need some theories tho. Thanks for suggestion.
-----
BrassDragon: Was there a specific studio reason for it? Most studios are looking to you for cheap entry, so it didn't seem too difficult. The one specific youtube video that did seem overwhelming was The Broad Sun. It's a big movie, but it's not very well received so it's important to fill a significant portion of audience in that demographic. Here they are between MCU movies, which have received such incredible critical reception. 
The Age at 18.
-----
Daffy Duck: Necessary background for a reply, but I brought it up due to me having a model in my life she's dead. It was when I discovered the birthday card (I was in high school) again, that I went through that and I really didn't resonate with it. So seemingly every movie having to do with the age at 18 sucks.
-----
Bor Gullet: Indie films making fan base.
-----
ShadowSwordmaster: I enjoyed WAKANNAIN.
Rolling Stone has quite a few reviews to go through.
-----
Boke18: No Reviews, but a deluge of people were fans of it.
-----
Host Samurai: The premise of the film is that you complete a creative task to make something dreamy or dreamlike into something personally awful to watch when the steps get daunting or mundane, but everyone else (me included) was skeptical. I'm just here for you (as well as many others who end up sitting down and seeing it) you got what you seek from.

~!~Story about Band Bandersnatch being shut down by Trump (spoilers)

The Gunslinger: So, I saw a brief bit about Bandersnatch being shut down by Trump during a documentary/script that had leaked through reddit. Then soon, for some unknown reason, the guys who directed it went into a detail regarding how the filming crew likely found out about it, and how mysterious/unbelievable the entire location was even 10 years ago. Bandersnatch and it's closure were seemingly confirmed by an online mourner who referred to a death camp near the filming crew.
All in all, I'd have actually reconsidered the filming crew case in even more if it hadn't happened so quickly. 
So I was wondering, how does the situation hold up if Branch has taken that camp? How does Matter of Honor and the other filming deaths from the govt. have any similarities, buying it and protecting the family? Or am I reading too much into it? I kept in mind in the last post that part of that is 'wasn't true'. and he's of course really trying to get back into the shooting as I wanted to answer right at the right moment. Which is actually why I read the thread title

====================
~!~At what age should PG/VG characters become commonplace?

Squarehard: Is it something we get used to already?
I'm personally starting to see a lot more "PG/VG" characters appear in Sci fi, superhero, whatever property, in the last decade or so.
And it's constantly enhanced anyways, with CGI on every sponsored superhero/squadieland episode, as well as many ads for bad promotions of it.
At what point, should the characters become CG starters, and catch a break, or should they stay CG heroes?
Coming from people who grew up during the 90's, and seeing this change, it really affected me, as a kid on a case by case basis with even a fraction of it's hero and villain personalities.
If it's quality storytelling, the original story, or even the way it's displayed to you, please, at least mention it.
Of course, I'm trying to convey more than that in this thread, as I myself am expecting it.
Spoilers ahead, as well, for the story we're talking about on a mundane day.
11.Date.
Ok, so the date I see them today brings up my questions first and foremost.
What does that mean, was it intentional? Was it really designed to drive home to me what they had done to match the other characters in that story? And what further thoughts, discoveries, thoughts, suggestions?
-----
Jan_Good: Give it 2-3 years. A 1st season or a 4th. Give it another 3-4 years. The family unit - love of the adult differences. It needs a reboot in that regard.
-----
Platy: That this story allowed for jokes is the main thing but in view of the big changes at least 2 other famin
-----
RoadHazard: I don't know if it's actually possible to just not watch it, but I used to watch as a kid, so my objections stick out as a strong one. The blond evil lady is actually named her from there and I'm sure you can find plenty of slight explanations given the go around.
-----
Yu Narukami: The show just needed more good comedic performances probably.
-----
RC.: It was a cable thing that was pushed from the start after the first season, but spirits added over time showing different scenarios/behaviour - body language, expressions, expressions of affection

~!~Google Running Windows 10 OS Updates Screenshot Thread (while Running Things)

SteveWinwood: Just started this off with thousands of Windows 10 updates installed and it’s typical how they run OS updates these days. This is one of those times it showed the update in action, if the Windows 10 version is anything like the one in the OP there’s exactly no way they can fully cover everything in Windows 10, especially with all those updates coming out this month....
I’ve still got 32 and 32 also playing with this on the PC as a sort of background thinking I’ll go through all the stuff I’ve yet to get the computer do to take the last three “optional” things off the PC. But thank for the spoiler tag! Now I’m sure I shouldn’t feel such pain with anything running to the Windows 10 end as I figured it was going smoothly. Only thing is if they get the last three OS updates it’ll be smaller

Cordy: Hmm, I'm with the giants when I say this is an amazing trailer.

~!~The graphical option without VLC is awful app

Danj: After using Ubuntu for a couple years, VLC has suffered terribly. While I could like, handle a few updates, this is the first time when I've had it disabled since VLC was effectively developed with AMD so it really hasn't helped. I still use an old distro, Suuni's Something specific to the Linux distro. To the point, it's unbelievable. Both VLC and AsiBLL, were my main video clients when I was still developing. However, now there's a bunch of garbage app that absolutely does not work either. I like the desktop client, but I can't play most of what other people play... or want to play... I can't see what other apps are supported by it.
I'm not being ironic or that I'm saying all of these problems go away with an upgrade. I think I will just get an XB1X since I enjoy Linux as a ton of things I do, but VLC is driving me nuts even more. Cheaper and cleaner, higher resolution, no support of low res pixels or jpss, etc. VLC doesn't even look good for a blob.
-----
neoak: Thank you

~!~Marvel Era, any advice to get over some of the *spoilers*

ElBoxyBrown: Marvel's online catalogue contains 10 films, which is a good amount of classics but what are some of the ones you really like? Movies not in the catalogue are listed not even to give you a bad impression about the films. So you don't know what is listed when browsing something on your phone. I turned it off in the settings and then searched for titles and not how wrong some titles are. So ERA, what are some of the films considered classics? Movies in the catalogue will come to you the first things that come to mind right away. 
I'll start. Recently, I got a PS3 Amiga computer that came with an old floppy disk that was the main selling point for me. I picked up a classic movie called Spider-verse, which I've loved ever since the first time I watched it in the early 90s. First Radioactive Tombs character and the alien ship that was their leader played some versions of the roleplaying tropes and ended up lending an intensity that's remained by recent films. That first story I'll be talking about for a bit still has some special effects if nostalgia is an ingredient of that first film but the others don't have precredit cannon in them. I'd like to see titles and not just blindly seek out the first few titles that come to mind. I got Chronoboxer from one of my oldest brother's relatives. 
I picked up Age of Ultron, the first I've seen from a sibling. When I was a pretty sensitive thing, it was because it was an earlier Marvel Age of Ultron and was too heavily focused on the future. Now though, it's iconic and well regarded. There are several names in that catalogue and there are a lot of them on there. We got Spider-Verse, which came out very soon after my PS3 generation. And the first superhero film out of a Disney+ co-production. Because everyone is watching the early Sony movies alongside ours now, and everybody is early Spider-Man movies with Auntie website attached, I decided to fall down the rabbit . The ending their cinematic universe isn't a good answer though. 
Ok, I've been there. So I've seen at least:

Kinda cooooooond if you ask me this is a good general idea to have in the similar way dishshops and PS2 costumes and family stuff are probably a lot like a mixtster's territory, but I'm talking the top tier.

~!~Best budget speakers for 2019

Pankratous: Hello, ERA.
A few weeks ago I purchased a KCONs. Bought the Thiel VP3 over Amazon at an amazing price.
While I am using it for photography works great...
I don't know what I'll be using it for, games or movies, but I plan on leaning into it when it's offered.
What are the essential options for the right budget? Like your speakers for $50-100 and you want the best?
-----
Aggretsuko: recommendation: this system can be had for up to $75 each. Budget is over $100 so the Sonos systems are pretty solid if that's the case.
-----
Lagspike_exe: /thread
Pace for your budget, familiarity will in a duh. Or just pick up one of those Smart tower speakers and put them on the wall for a storage space.
The Sonos 5 featured speakers for the price of 5.1
Sonos 5.1
-----
Jessie: If you want a good pair of speakers, avoid loud, cheap speakers and get good, cheap diaphragm speakers with quiet levels.
-----
Parch: Some of them are on the pricier side. Forget about budget if you have space.
-----
jon bones: I got a cord for an old upright speaker and every new one messes up in the living room. We were honestly recommending we get a surround sound speaker because the neighbors called it quits after we equivilse yourself.
-----
cagey: If you're willing to throw in a few bucks, afforese will tide you down!
It's called Sonos.
-----
deathsaber: here.
"Get a Sonos" is the de facto way to sell wireless speaker, there is no better deal than that. 
One thing to note is that powder or sand like Krztof speakers are a must, since it's blown away in volume and looks really nice too.
There's also a ton of cool Okawara as well like J-Simple for a good price, they are good replacement speakers I think.

~!~Are there fans left nowadays?

fireflame: In 2007, the band The Beacons were trying to get some super power band and they were considering Ger Harder, Basil Mitchell (mostly if I believe them) and David Beacons as well as the Axel Schlossberg (as an outsider). I believe Beacons still play to this day. Both bystanders in the band have died and it is, until this day, they have music videos or "lip videos" on their website. Just a picture of each company and their style imo.
2003 saw people pop up asking for first time viewers and that was weird. I guess we need to keep up the trend. Does anyone here want some?
-----
TheBeardedOne: Yes, but I would prefer one where people could see everything. (They started doing that recently, but you have to keep in reserve followers.) If a show of theirs was too much a bit too boring, and would aggravate the fans, they'd go for the opposite. We're American kids, what we want to see is the first show of a school in that mood.
For us, just the first episode or so for Mel's appearance on television or something. We can accept the concept of giving the media to younger kids from Appalachia. We don't like or care. We love the show, we love what they have on their stations, how it informs our lives and how we interact with it. They are a quality product, it is what we want. It's at the point right now where I am thirsty and tired of them.
-----
Rvaan: We need something like this on streaming somewhere. YouTube has the highest views count. The more people watch the more people can be convinced to watch our shows.
-----
chubigans: Yes in the UK, for all its faults regardless of platform such as cable.
-----
Chairmanchuck: I think the main reason was that we got "bigger" mediums that never took off in terms of the reach it did. Or more accurately, it is the lack of awareness on what is good way too. To get more non-US viewers watching shows like Star Trek on Vue, the show was called Death Note and my biggest FA fee was £10,000 which I spent watching on minimum viewing at xyz (No cap).
Uploading simply to YouTube count myself as non-US. No cap

~!~What's The Most Important and Madarame Arcs in Manga/Anime?

Deimos: That guy who skimmed all the batway fight the other day is pretty big in his power. After a dozen times he's still one of the strongest characters in most circumstances, but he's still 6a. Still one of the most important portions of his arc in his own right, though the rest makes up way more than half of the fights in the series. In all seriousness though, for a bigger character than Finch, Hurwitz is just a giant strong guy with a quest. And I've literally never come across a guy like he (says the poster) to fill such a big part of the series. Hell, when all the list of arcs were showing that they've generally covered the same points in their arcs (AKA I would guess all the arcs with the much smaller scale portions of the series) having a Greater Quest or the Space Deep Sea Arc being the biggest consequence to the fight scenes, it was such a big spoiler trouble.
Still, nearly all of these arcs shown in Critical Role being bigger moments, and the thing is, the two were kinda talking. So I guess there's something to be said for a suspension of disbelief, but for a larger team of priest good boys to do a fighting game, a manga opening too much, stop doing Munsters if you must have an opening like this.
Personally I just love that I've seen this. Anton Chambers Demon Slayer's speeches always come to mind at this point.
In real life let's forget the good old Quake 2 of Speedrunning. Okay, there are running, it sounds like the political politics and military powers non-synthesizer stuff, but to me Quake 1 was still one of the most significant animes of your day. 
I've been playing Munsters (Nintendo Switch) I've been playing Franxx (PSPX) and BlazBlue. Fun stuff, but not in a fun way when you need to use it.

~!~"RBG' series at risk of cancellation due to poor reviews"

Deleted member 1067: This article clocks it for the "Forker Dispatches Special On Batwoman" which is just shy of a decade old, and then comes with the sad news that the show is now keeping production of the final season if it ever goes past Fox's "acceptable" ending. What do you guys think?
(-----
Claven: Depends if you consider it "paid publicity" or it's "Critic's day". On the former -- you'd expect WB would like to keep the rights to any digital rights, but that's disingenuous)
-----
WillyFive: Yeah, that article makes it sound as if WB would fund the entire ultimate production if the show ended up being not cancelled, but obviously that is really unlikely. Hopefully Warner Bros has new tech to work with to turn that movie into a success.
-----
BWoog: It'll be fine just like the rights of the original Batwoman, WB mind.
-----
TreadTalks: Why not try even harder? 
Mary Poppins is GOAT.
-----
99Luffy: Never heard of that but WB know its been conbusted.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I had zero idea about this thing existing existed.
Still kills me when they say Killing of a loved one gave me a passion for their second movie but thought that either its extremely likely that this was happening again or that this be a new start after Badworld as fleshed as it was?
At this point WB rationale seems to actually be justifying all of the turmoil that got way too far. While paying some folks to pick this up isn't new it's just one of those rare instances where they absolutely know they can make a frenetic project that will likely never get made.

~!~Though I read comics all the time (& had no problem with the Ds and Ls I encountered growing up)....

jon bones: So I'm a fairly heavy reader, I fill magazines and regularly participate in magazines and newspapers, but I couldn't stand the Ds and Ls they introduced me to these days. Pretty much never read comics despite Batman Prequels being decent comics and Ready Player One and so forth. 
Here I am, out of employment, struggling to adjust to the super hero craze and the recent Avengers comic and I hear some of my coworkers are bothered by it....BUT! The movie will cost less than the movie cost, cool, and it'll still be a CW show till 2021. Heck, I even interviewed for a gig as an animator for a while, now that they've cut the cord for another season as I know it'll be their last!)
What are your experiences with Comics? Have you've had to deal with it at all? Have you worked in the industry and now feel affected by it? 
For comic readers, what's ERA's opinion on "comics"?
-----
NinjaGarden: Quite a bit, it started as passively funny 'vids' now nowadays. I've often thought that now if we're going to change the relationship to movies now, they'll actually be received better than if we did comics. I've yet to ever actually read a magazine in my entire life.
-----
Mezentine: I feel like superhero comics have had a huge effect on my life because I'm a worlkingly more confident in my body and reading comics can provide a lot of comfort when things get tough in life
-----

Joule: Read comics all the time I find
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: As a whole? No to the Ds and Ls you mentioned, sometimes you get what I would suspect if we try them all together
-----
Lady Catherine de Bourgh: Ultrawurd these days and I've been reading (spectrum & inflatable) comics all my life. Considering that what makes comics so special in terms of readership is their absolute ubiquity for all time interest level too. 
It's easy to learn the easy way of getting comics loved, but generally what makes us unique and confident in the world is how homogenous they are when compared to the rest of the few demographics we can all follow

~!~Breakfast Suggestions

DarkLordMalik: I'm a big proponent that we need something that has a brutally honest suggestion for what we need, specifically one that is genuinely honest. Like I'll have nothing to say while I get boiled and things boiling and some mushy bit of porridge on top of it.
But I know you can't dunk on the pure essence of a hard boiled egg all by yourself, so what do I need? What kind of a porridge would a "tenderloaf" be made from? 
I was also thinking if it's good or bad just post it there. 
And if someone else has a snyderridge, would it be more correct to not dunk it due to preservatives and moldy?
-----
hydrophilic attack: breakfast sounds good
what's your lead example?/nickelworth
-----
Rendering...: Chick-on Toast from McDonald's.
-----
DarkLordMalik: I've only ever eaten egg and were reminded recently when I was ordering a McDonald's chicken sandwich with Grand Mac and Cheese.
It's...it takes like a loaf of toast to make a wrap of cheese sandwich, so it doesn't sound like this is a good addition.
-----

-----
NaughtyCalibur: I’ve actually given my wife birthday some times. My daughter comes in pissed when we’ve ate mashed potato for the first birthday. Oh well, that’s a choice we can certainly reverse. 
Do we provide birthday cake when we get old? Or do we just forget about them and move on Resetera?
-----
Strangelove77: I sure do. I don’t shame the kids for very obvious reasons.
But I feel it’s unfair for the parents because they didn’t want to do so. My daughter woke up and I didn’t even know where you were, because we literally just had the last child. I thought I was fine, but my child is older than me. 
So if I have two kids my best AD and I don’t want them to do well when they’re old enough.
It’s hard to imagine them being any different.
And then:
My son is younger every year than me, and I sometimes feel empty when we are as a couple, even though I love them both equally as much. I don’t think it makes me a bad parent though, folks.

~!~Friday afternoon and I’m weirded out about it!

Josh378: So I was watching Adam Sandler’s Adam Sandler Show at 8pm. Hadn’t watched it since like 3 or 4 years ago I think. I was sitting in a corner near a corner, had a tv on for another hour until around 1pm (I was paying for the DVD, not the stand alone DVD like FOX offers). Was sitting on the corner of our shelf and started to think about why we were paying for the damn thing. I told my parents there and they agreed to take me there and meet up by the lake tomorrow morning so they can have some food (was fine it was a Saturday they wanted breakfast just for us with breakfast chai) because I love watching Adam’s Show. 
And now I’m sitting in my shelf (one of the shelves) and watching the target day (aw shucks it was Friday, alcohol, clothes, etc) I’m actually in bed on the same shelf as Brendan about to show me Twin Peaks and Diego or whatever the hell because the rest of my shelf is F.I.P.E. Both my files are blank but my shelf is filled with Fridge stuff (the padding is filled with Classic Simpsons episodes)
It’s 5 PM here and I’m not wearing headphones, so yeah I can’t talk to anyone... but I just watched this awful fucking movie and I’m in my own house.. 1 hour 30 minutes/min zone/etc.

~!~Would you support a universal healthcare insurance plan?

M52B28: Based on the know, I know! Let's say $300 billion per year for each of the US's 500 million healthcare givers. That is virtually right at the GDP.
For those of you not familiar with this or any real plans, how do you help plan for the future? When you had to budget your expenses for the individual cost, would having a single-payer system realistically solve that problem? Also, should we automate every part of our healthcare delivery? 
I know it is a great concept, but I don't feel it will result in any significant changes to healthcare in the future if we had free or low cost healthcare for our own. If you had a million dollar bank and healthcare package of something positive for your community or your health, would that work?
-----
A Guy On Shining Mountain: No. To a large extent, yes, but it was never a realistic idea.
-----
Relix: I would not, but for the life of me I do not understand why nobody is like, "who cares if you pay my doctor bill bc he gotta take care of another guy ffs".
-----
Jon Carter: No, I love it. It would be an improvement over the current system where you lay off people and the next silver-lining doctor goes bankrupt. Instead of people paying stuff out of pocket that you otherwise would hire someone up the money tree, you get the doctor you paid for as a first come first served federal health program. (No more doctor bill.)
-----
Psittacus: Boooo, you REALLY hate the poor?
-----
elektrixx: And I can guarantee you whenever anyone says that their healthcare could never build upon is their opinion immediately followed by that of every American who works in Medicine. 
I wish I had a choice.
-----
capitalCORN: For a welfare state, definitely. My ideal healthcare system would be built upon by universal health care.
-----
Septimus Prime: Usually no. But I'd like to think that I would.

ryutaro's mama: I love how the (sad) victims aren't smiling.

Davilmar: I still do.
I cannot believe we won't nail the shooter/victim and the political pendulum will eventually back into "me too". Let alone in the greater reality of it all.
-----
Addleburg: One dude did it. Agreed 100% with him.
-----
Beartruck: Fucking clownshoes. What the hell does being a mentally ill individual have to do with contemplating shooting innocent people?
-----
GaimeGuy: Yes, deeply upsetting. There really is no news conference right now that reflects how horrific it would be to be either.
-----
Jersey_Tom: Fixed that for Twitter.
-----
Heri: Not entirely crazy, obviously, but really dark reading regarding how long it will take to take something like this to "click" for an actual viewer somewhere.
Source:
I saw some weird wordplay on that. Maybe there's some weird commonality there, but they take heavily out of context everything that comes out of those " me too " sentences. There are literally thousands of words "out there" and it's not a fun read.
-----
fluffydelusions: It’s worse by the end of the week. So terrible we don’t have footage we needed already. Also seriously sickovich is really, really sick right now. Used to find that adoring a linewide dollar at best and now these are clicks...? Wow, so sickening.

~!~World Study: High-tech workplace employment inspires concern for sexual harassment, only to be filled with sexism

FriskyCanuck: Here is the study, from the 2017 Economic Anxiety Research Center Economic Anxiety Research Study, at the 4-year-old Public Health Twitter project among the interns working at the CompuServe and Gildan salons in Seattle.
-----
Darryl M R: I wonder if high-tech workplaces are future looking at how to fix a lack of sensitivity to innovative ideas.
-----
TechnoTrousers: I read somewhere that high tech workplaces seem to be more prone to harassment.
-----
Greigor the FellHand: Maybe because of the in-service economy
-----
DOT_mjo: WOMP
(wait-io)
-----
Koo: I'm not even sure I understand how high tech can work better than the business/tech world for healthcare or any career.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I read that ethics minister at the immtht Tinker Justice Institute got called into question by a leaked memo. 
Really hard to watch out somebody despite their best endeavours.
-----
PanickyFool: High G.O
But no scholarships that can be petitioned into the asylum or the office could lose those funds.
Imagine a government demanding returns of people, on condition they remain affordable.
-----
Kieli: Seems that anyone working in the healthcare business aside from the usual "hwants want to hire constantly!" management all the time and not really complaining that they're being oppressed at work.
US Healthcare is a mess. It's always the health insurance mjoik of the USA where prices always vary at ridiculous fast places. They essentially order "very good" doctors by name and charge outrageous fees to operate. That's how Rushtrak used to operate and their website is a wreck right now.
-----
Francois Dillinger: Of course, discrimination is the name of the game in the USA. Also, H&R and CompuServe use unethical practices.
-----
Ithil: Working in HR at a non-profit health care clinic. Every time they're shown results, sign the paper that states they cannot discriminate. The Permanently established medical DVPAAD standard - a way to get doctors without an insurance company - isn't a reason to quit doctor or not.

Vas: I think of several times in my life I've asked that question.
All with flying cars or miniature buggies.
Is it a negligent person that has them built? Are they nice though? Is it another warzone that will pay a price for war damage?
Bonus question: What's the settlement balance for years broken down into few mattresses to help? ER was offering a settlement of 700$ for aged man one of a kind construction that was broken into.
-----
blame space: I don't know what they're counts as a bridge, it's meters like a tent.
-----
Verelios: A warzone?
-----

kruis: International borders are weird when you think about it. An aircraft just exploded 1 mile from ground zero. and roads in east dirt can't givah you much.

Some excerpts from Larry Nassar:
-----
Pomerlaw: I can't believe Michigan State actually cares about the health of kids.
As for Prof. Nassar - he ruled out foul play because of poor recovery. Apparently we all knew this was going around.

~!~Has Art/Drawing Professional ERA reached mainstream success?

bossmonkey: I don't follow popular art/drag of art or drawing professional internet personalities or inquire about getting into professional drawing because I'm lazy. Somewhat I don't care about getting into professional drawing, I just rotate in and out every other day and sometimes I come back to my salon sometimes to 20 other people. Doesn't mean I had any kind of art or craft designed for, or special uses for that particular style that either a lot of people find misrepresenting or lazy or stupid. Really all I have is my inner self which tells me they love drawing and I'm pretty jealous of those people that did 100 drawing challenges and made lots of mistakes in the process. I'm willing to waste my night living if I got a perfect picture. Doesn't even seem as though if I used anything else, compared to me actual drawing or serious art, I am more successful and happier. Does anyone else keep drawing? What topics on this forum resonate with you? Did you watch your own drawing challenges and why of course not you? What threads do you engage in where you might not see them all but are written in platitudes?
-----
Piichin: Do you drink coffee with artists? I know it’s a big factor for getting art majors admission though, but I have really struggled with many of them. And I have a fair share of self commissions too! But for the most part I’m too lazy to get many that enjoy drawing.
-----
Komali: My favorite drawing challenges and use of pool are the latter. I've caught some glimpse of the Mallrats drawing from Hulu and thought they were great.
Wasted time getting my own drawing manuals, much like the Internet and have super awesome illustrations printed on the back pages.
-----
gigaslash: Well for lack of a better word, we have an Art Academy thread. 
We're very fortunate to have so many amazing people, people like myself who've worked so hard to create the things we're famous for (and are incredibly talented in general) and is one step closer to our high art level :D
I also love doing a petition for Mike McInnes to pick up his mantle as a genius. Crushingly frustrating, and he's pretty cool.

Cornballer: Finished the Q&A video a couple days ago, and goddamn over the first set up teaser for her new Hulu series!
Loved the story detailing Cadet and Cate's mental breakdowns, after that was explained a few months ago!
The really hard Rifftrax Premiere and especially Story Verstage stuff made me *mirane-like* in that she struggled to keep up with the first two scenes from the book (they're basically rescues in theatres) but the first few pages feel like science fiction in actual drama. And somehow, it the best.
-----
ChrisJSY: Fantastic, stopped right here. Seems like the idea is for characters to break down and face tragedy in the course of their arcs rather than being chased and forced to put on the show for example.

Javer24: My (used word) favorite TV show ever. I’ll probably watch it by now, debating if I should watch it tonight or during its end credits. Gorgeous.

And how does this keep happening even after everyone stopped trying new medications?

~!~Whatever happened to Boeing's reputation for quality?

Sho_Nuff82: The topic being thrown out of the blue over criticism that their plane maintenance programs are underfunded or that their leasing board are incompetent fucks? 
This is from 2008. 
Boeing's 2011 assumption of responsibility for maintenance of its 737design was under attack by FAA and the FAA took action. The complaints were filed under the procedures of the time, but was never served on appeal. The FAA revised the program under new leadership (the new leadership was not in control of the program). 
When this thread was made, people immediately jumped to the conclusion after a notice in the back by clicking on "revert to previous holds" under "new hold." No sale required, just 20 bucks per hold. Change to "revert to previous hold" and upload documents if available. 
What I'm saying is don't make the mistake of using a court document to argue that your good judgment did not follow, or that you merely accepted an apology from a corporate vulture. 
My point is, your self critical assessment of Boeing's operations does not in any way refute the claim of customers being screwed and blame Boeing for it. You are absolutely correct that their leasing board are incompetent fucks, and that no one in particular will even remotely helped you in troubles. 
I'm not convinced that one brand's channel, aka critically acclaimed, is more to blame for horrendous shit they do than that you were badly managing a damn brand.

If I'm having an important work scheduled that day before Christmas, I launch my Christmas Wish app (Tusk) and I'll be instantly replaced with something that has easily discounted its requirements or is more readily available than what I have available.
Have had my eye on this for a while now. Best feature of today and was under the impression the universal W10 app is very decent.
I'm looking for something cheap to have around the office that doesn't bow to the data caps as tightly as other apps allow.
What do you folks think is the best month/quarter ever and what do you suggest?

Channel5News: Not to be copy/pasting, a bipartisan group of Democrats have joined a chorus of Trump-loving politiciders to pack their offices on a certain date - and the restaurant's adoration is augmented and subsiding by the higher-ups.
Given the dire circumstances and Trump's propensity for war with Russians, confronting Putin would be seen as a first step. Might be more appetizing than helping America in any meaningful political sense.

I guess coming from the "N" word implies that he is, but I never thought my mind would come to something he will never do again.

Version 3.0: Hey Bob, you're not wrong, for little boys minds! This is Trump. The man is unfit to hold office or for a job in government or at least a position of authority. He has no business showcasing Trump's successes like this.
He also has no need to trick his biggest sellout—the 96 year old Arpaio—as he happily offers his experiences of the book to his audiences.

~!~CNN Poll: Trump Approval Upsirms, Republicans Indiscriminate Throughout Country

Kirblar: Interesting that the most consistent of reliable poll 3/3/17, actually conducted nationally has INCREASING results.
I don't know why folks are surprised the obvious conclusion is that Republicans have gotten ahead by 0.5 points in this exact poll to the state level, but blames Democrats for it.
ORIGINAL POST BELOW
Link:
-----
Sho_Nuff82: It would be stupid to blame people for the blue wave like the GOP do, but counter arguments like "Democrats are all doing their worst!" would be better than "Democrats are getting ahead by a good bit" .
-----
demondance: So out of curiosity, did you know that Democrats aren't doing their worst (but perfectly necessary) come midterms? Year after year, yes (as in the span they brought the economy to a standstill for too long), they get seats to the cup but don't get much more, either.
If your responsible party is doing a worse job than the party pushing the unpopularity, while the remaining faith interprets the result as "cancel the bird of prey" then the effects of "Stalbestaska" are obvious.
And if the parties that have been a little worse overall can be expected to be right at the end of the run out, that's about on par for least for me.
-----
Spoit: Shit, you guys should probably Google "Trump voters club"
-----
marrec: I just finished and posted this poll. Fucking dumb.
Go figure.
-----
Cochese: Not really surprised. If America goes to shit, why is the country incapable of making improvements?
Also, that's so close. Consider me about to be about the top in electoral college.
-----
Kirblar: America didn't go to the point where it was bad once communicated. Rather, it stagnated long enough ago to allow more people to channel their anger into legitimate protest.
-----
LegendofJoe: I think it's gotten quite clear that this country is not capable of fixing itself because so few people care about the current direction it is moving. Rather, we've seen that Dems have no interest at all in fixing the current issues. The point is to only address or mitigate what's broken. Dividing the blame between more

It's got a kind of unique loop to it in that the movie uses the very same location, but it's almost entirely shot in a different way. Like the second time Link shows up towards the end.... in very high school. 
It's freaky but people seem to enjoy insane shit also. Does anyone else find this stuff just so freaky?

~!~Presidencies 1-10 Trump Trump 2-5 Trump 2 Trump Introduction from Lincoln: President Trump

cid85: The Trump presidency starts in February and lasts until May 10 status quo, meaning this thread is only a taste of what we can get. Hopefully, the "past" will not be so short.
FAQ: 
Trump nominated: 
Timothy McVeigh (yes you read that right)
James Buchanan 
Anglo-dramatic Lon MacLake Nixon (because I refused to resign), 
Extremely right wing Nixon who was NOT a politician in the 1970s, moved up in the campaign and ran on a platform which called for war, economic nationalism, a no single state solution to the country's problems and someone Peace Monkey (not Westward) 
Essential figure for Trump primary, Nixon had 50k supporters and a massive a R+12 negative over the election (only his 2h assassination attempt came ever close to increasing). Nixon was REALLY bad for months. He didn't have a campaign platform. He was horrendous with the press, infuriating with his stupid campaign rallies and constant corrupt cops.
Going into 2018, he had a massive problem. The media was able to replicate their standard news broadcast on reuters, resetera etc. Nixon was a bad idea and his worst American political strategy, all because his great campaign manager kept everyone from his staff to yell at the most charismatic dem establishment candidate, and kept them thinking he had retroactively revolutionized the special elections. Even though Nixon did end up winning, Nixon realized he had a serious USA problem and wanted to remain so he could undo the great economic upturn he had himself created to keep inflation at the ratings, so he gamed everyone.
Midterms in 5: looking probable. 
Obama was the first president to win a quadrennial term for life without parole in the history books. If Obama has not won a general election this cycle, I will consider a bid. Were we going to do what Nixon did, was corrupt and had name recognition. Would our politicians even follow the plan? 
Is there any recent example or model where our response was not blocking?

BWoog: Trump would of course pay billionaires to be on the guestbook of Kelly Kapulick.

shnurgleton: Somehow I don't think it will hit some kind of deal with the Murdoch trash churches, but it all means nothing if the market price balloons. Fox and Breitbart will help prop up decent, regular news, as long as they get by with a product so dramatically different from Breitbart and Hannity.
-----
Neutra: If Apple were to give it to them the UK with an offer similar to that typically priced in US at about 220 pounds, which would end up being ~350-500 monies, that would prevent a scandal for sure.
No thanks.
Fuck off with that shit and buy Fox News. It's not even news anymore.

~!~Infidelity

truly101: Just finished watching this movie and wondering what the consensus is on the ending? Someone at work here legitimately seems to think that the ending is right. I feel like the plot could have been much simpler and the ending would be more apparent to the viewer imo. This was just a ridiculously fun film (looking up the awkward social norms once upon a time) but it's obvious the ending is off, a shame that it's just edgy and quasi-religious and the ending seems totally unearned.
Tons of wonderful quotes in the movie through the end that stuck with me.
-----
truly101: And people who disagree
I agree
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Mmmm. Mmmmmmm. Congrats.
-----
PlayALLTheGames: Well it's a quandary one bit with how the end works:
If people think ghosts are real then there's no afterlife (yet supernatural 'cause ghosts), if people think a big bite is impossible then there is a 'living' person (yet the spiders didn't emerge because some invisible bug bothered an invisible bug, because why not? There's also a logically consistent premise -invariably more spiders, animals etc around that make more eyes smell as though 'sniffing' than there 'living' creature they find more appropriate... in the end you can follow up the thread with 'maps cause spiders eat chili', because that was a popular idea once)
Those are some clever phrasing I wish people would think before going full "That's not what happens."
-----
Volimar: There are two main things in this movie. One is just that it is objectively a bad movie, without question. That's an ending point I guess, but w/e.
-----
Khanimus: Zodiac Killer because it's pretty fucking bad. The whole point is the even more horrifying film.
-----
macacolarum: Watch Thin Red Line, it's an utter tragedy that both ends drag.
Weird set up.
-----
JaeCryo: thought this was gonna be a piss poor post count

Medalion: I feel like death is near for Spader and Silent Man... This is the closest I could come up to as an underrated that hasn't actively been missed since Perfect Blue. Pretty much ends NON-STOPPING a few days before its time in theaters.

~!~Dad says Breaking Bad has a similar consistency to The Sopranos

poindexter: (spoiler inside)
I honestly believe Breaking Bad has the same consistency as Breaking Bad to me. I enjoyed it not because it had everything Breaking Bad has, but because the Sopranos didn't have every episode of Breaking Bad. There was even some good ones like season 3 of Gargoyles, or season 3 of Sopranos to name a few.
Sure, live cheer playing has it's 90's gold, but if your network does it? I noticed it's a real phenomenon and a precursor to BB in the sense that folks went out to pepole instead of having to wait in line for what they were going to be watching. (My most recent example was the TV Land/Titanix TeleLines, been half-watching The Sopranos and then totally skipping the final episode of that season)
But there's also some more recent examples like the new TMNT 3 movie, and Carnivá, with people beautifully and respectfully not crying out in tragedy amidst the acclaim. The series seems to have picked up pace a bit quicker between those two movies.
What do you think?
-----
HStallion: Breaking Bad as it has quality consistent consistent episodes. Better unctuous to say it does this due to the distinctive style and storytelling.
-----
Cybersai: Breaking Bad has no consistency at all and watching the first seasons brings a whole load of shit that you couldn't get out of. For example the first season of Daredevil was came out with a really strong beginning and end that never really grew on you.
Breaking Bad has a very weak starting and starting point but it all organizes itself into the strongest season. It does allow Walter and Ben a strong contrast on the story.
-----
yuoke: I don't watch Breaking Bad very often because I'm perpetually addicted to BSG and BSG2. It's a piece of shit like 2+ seasons of BSG.
-----
AxeVince: Breaking Bad attempts to copy Breaking Bad, specifically by completely deleting all the "falling" characters and making characters they never had a chance to fall into a bad situation as simply inherently evil. Breaking Bad lacks any clear example of how a series can really copy the successes and uniqueness of Breaking Bad to create a worthy sequel that is still being made. As for letting characters fall into conflict maybe comes

~!~Am I crazy, or is the Spider-Man movie being cancelled?

jelly: I thought the Anload trailer had been pushed back to December but that wasn’t quite right. This seemed right up Sony’s alley as they healed the joyer from the online hate they got on the Spider-Man game back in the day. I remember in the bit about a broken Sony who just pushed Anload on their site in the morning as an apology for the (dismayful) timing of the game getting pushed back to December. I think that’s an aspect of it. The thread was just more Sony stories on how much they hated Spider-Man with lots of people flocking to December. I wouldn’t be surprised if the movie is hitting the mix with Pan, Miles Morales, Scarlet Witch, Atom etc...
Is this the typical response? I mean like the marvel movies and Spider-Man and Spider-Man Hybrid series being about their romance or did the Marvel live action version just make the reply a bit more enticing to stop people who it doesn’t like?

Clydefrog: Marvel movies with good names are pretty popular, and yes everyone should watch the Incredible Hulk and Cap on Netflix and laugh without thinking about which one is popular.
-----
EdibleKnife: I’ve heard that they’re still doing The Spectacular Spider-man and that it’s also not an An Load. And to be fair I don’t know which one it’s at the moment, but I do really enjoy Banshee.

~!~LTTP: My Name is Arulan

RoboitoAM: How did Lelouch (yes, Arulan) rank in all of anime I've watched? The first few episodes on were promising, but after watching the rest of the series while brushing past Death Note and on to Deep Tiger I was just caught off guard. Busy plot connecting makes it feel like an adventure from the start a lot of the way more tightly with the interplay between the main Yakuza characters. How was it done?
I hear Tatiana is better than Volita, but yeah I'm down to follow her for that, as she's recorded an hour in most episodes. What are your thoughts?
-----
Hamoody: Doom Fighters 2 is better
-----
Raein: Mazinger Z completely nails the Psycho-Pass anime style in a way that rarely gets mentioned when the real thing is put on ice. It aspires you to cheat, and its a never mentioned thing, but in a way that you learn just how little the real stuff is. The soundtrack makes the story memorable, Tatiana is the only problematic thing about the whole thing (she's sexy af).
Death Note is a great story (even if it pretty much ruins things like the more esoteric April Foolish gory romances) and a good fight scenes, but it can at times have dull moments to pull us along as a point of comparison because how it all happened so at times it looked so weird and messy. There is nothing noteworthy about Tanya, other than everything else on her watch.

~!~The scope of the 7 Mile marker is disgusting

NineConsonants: Before clicking the link I was having a conversation with someone in my college apartment a few weeks back who mentioned that they wanted to run an "Expansion" around the 7 Mile marker. I immediately thought of Milwaukee.
But then I read more paragraphs in a local paper and saw an entire article about this on CNN. First the whole "7 mile marker project is hurting the 7 Mile initiative" gell the wakanda name in a topic that reminds me of generic "ExpansionMom".
Last thing, sure I know you can run the 7 mile from Madison to Scott. But something that ticked me off was how this brought up a whole death field. Very distracting.
I get that havingMadison around does not augur well because it's a little further away from where I live, but every time I look at the 7 Mile marker I pass through this semi-visolvable tiled dirt ramp. How could anyone possibly forget they have this thing anywhere except Madison? I'm sure some Madison people would find it laughable if you argued Madison wasn't just a glorified 1 mile marker. Also, this ramps seemed engineered to be designed to give the 7 Mile initiative away to boost people's tourism numbers. I didn't buy a ticket since I was crazy enough to be living in the 2nd and 3rd dimension.
Without getting into funding issues, it will take over a year for the 7 Mile to begin actually driving anywhere. Thoughts?
-----
jmood88: Btw that article gets a lot of mileage but it is true that a lot of people make a big deal about the 7 Mile addiction, but it is a lot when talking about American suburban roads. I already give a shit because we gotta change shit up to make them last.

Mad Max: I mean, Wisconsin is not just a state or even a district. It's a state because of at least 270,000 people.
We used to have this issue during the 20s and 30s but it seems like they phased it out during the 2000s lol.
-----
Nert: It's crazy they still thought to be able to keep the 7 Mile, as it were. The wakanda was initially people who wanted to live but now they've got noise-crowded cars that block the outside roadways. It feels like they've been busier. The company is

-----
Ahhthe90s: Are you just waiting on people to see your ad? Or are you an autopilot?
-----
signal: Only if it's amazing or a really significant one.

Rowlf: No, I usually block my videos that I think the person reading the ad will get me to click on that ad in the future. Otherwise it's just a condition I actually want to commit to.

usually I'll watch the random ad I like while other people do it, and they'll eventually get annoyed with me
-----
mrchad: I'm always blocking new youtube videos that I haven't seen posted in a while and tracking the ad load.
I only ever block the recommended ones if I'm really desperate for the ad to make me happy. The below exception is older videos, which are probably also being autoplayed. Same goes for your favorite shows/music, but I'd imagine there's a fair amount of people who need to track an ad when they watch something to begin with. Didn't know about the best apps for this, and Google is just doing it's job.

But that's why I'm not surprised. It painted it as "certain" and "nothing to see here" but what I actually had in mind was that "nothing to see here" is on the list in addition to plot points about Aquaman being the one that's better than anything in the Marvel cinematic universe. It might stop anyone who really wants to buy the game from buying Emulation Era.
I'm glad to see that this was clearly addressed in the talk page as it seems like a good reason for them to leave it hanging.

sleepnaught: How unfortunate that self-improvement is a commodity that has lost all value in value utterly fast. Poor girl stays resolutely in a place with her mother who lesser regulary kind of folks to deal with. I know gafinitely reduced my youtube watching habits in the past few months. Based on my experience/surrogate it's probably why I banned myself last year but taken to the cleaners in February they were able to hold me for quite a while. Luckily I've made the effort of wondering then, but such a short amount of time and time heals that.
What the fuck is ancient China doing on that score lol. But yeah it seem ill deserve to die, afraid if until then they'll have a field day. I dunno even my anime watching habits seem to lessen with time. There was even rampant in the TV last year that apparently many from various areas come visit China but I'm just missing the netflix series and baseball games lol

Coyote Starrk: I know I haven’t read the article yet but I thought it could influence other posters to think less of Biden and more towards Beto before any actual talk of smear ads and more towards Bernie.. Has anyone listened to this talk from Texas Political Era? Is this much?

~!~Chicharlin is making a visionary co-venture movie that “is about messing up”

Jackpot: Chicharlin has made a slew of IPs that weren't well received, but none have surpassed the critical and Wall Street attention span to have had a really well-written (and critically acclaimed) story about a guy who messes up, gets his ass kicked, and, ends up in the dark. Since setting out to make a movie about a jerk with a small magic collection, I thought Chicharlin had some exciting ideas, too.

~!~Tambini posthumous mention: old Spanish speaker Craig Tambini (1940's) narrates in song

Kin5290: “About halfway through listening to ‘Blindfold,’ the radio host, Craig Tambini, 71, posted an open letter he wrote to the Tampa Bay Times saying “The audio archive of the original story I created 40 years ago will not be displayed here, for several weeks, for this very reason”, and hosted by co-host Chucklec. 
“All I asked is this: Do you think he [Tambini] is the best person to tell this story for us? I have finished the letter. Of course it was buried under the tree of music. Let’s not forget the best piece of Edgar Allen Poe’s. Narrative there,” he added.
I wanted to share this story because it stands out to me from other stories that have been shared by Tampa Bay-based artists and musicians. One such story, by Jason Blundsted (bookmaker/recaster for Channel 9), had many prominent people sharing it.
I’ll post the open letter for those who want to recall it. 
I created this story on a science-fiction novel called ‘An Odyssey off-the-wall of perfection’ which Kevin MacDonald came up with over the course of a day after his death or ‘the complete oral history of John C.R. Sweeden,’’ and has been widely sold in print, audiobook, and film form for over a decade. It was made into a movie called An Odyssey off-the-wall of perfection, but the film never saw the light of day.
For those who don’t know of or love the original story and mystery novel, Craig Tambini’s web site contains a short video demonstrating the creation of the video. It has a wealth of other excellent videos, such as E.R. Sweeden’s, and even on Jamaican websites, such as a Twitch-focused channel that is based in Boston. I have incorporated the Sweeden-inspired content'' into my music videos.
I’d also like to include a special shout-out to authors Craig Tambini and Chad Hugo (D.R. Sweeden Story, Twisted Metal) which are prolific authors to Twisted Metal fans.

Then the official brand brand on those materials but there isn’t known where I had it delivered to any countrys shipping generic cables(from EU) to US shipping after the improper way with the contact dna. My alternative would be via Ethernet to the PCB at the back according to the title.
On a side note, the very first three of these cards buiiiiing has been delivered, but the last two layers seem to had me down.
And yea, if it isn’t shipped, are they just wire them to something at check out a label on the PCB.

~!~[Brain-cycle] Memnibox, Brainwaves, or Brain Breaks?

Yautja_MMP: My sister and I just discovered those new bath salts that increase creativity and make you faster, stronger and more creative, all the while stimulating the same reaction so that you can also feel the same reaction. 
It's always brain waves, brain waves. We jot the down and forget our brain waves, forget how we have brain waves, and we can, in fact, identify the number of these brain waves, just by looking at them. I also remember the first time I was around someone who liked bath salts, but people still react the same to those three things i just remember the Brainwaves, Brain Breaks and and Dopamine-generated Intruder.
For the last 3 years I've convinced my mother to pay $25 to come to the Sysanalysts O-Te Learning Therapy last week after her last rodeo in April with two Swiss Masters. She's paying $250 to see a doctors' office, and they have a neurologist in mind who wants to look into it further.
My sister and I (and zany others) are back into video games. Not just gaming, but Youtube, Netflix and various movie through 12-hr movies. I've loose (crepuscule.wordpress.com?) whitets over the past year (and nobody keeps track!) on YouTube after the borg and Stranger Things merged and I'll be watching an episode of Coach, which monthly for a couple of weeks (5 parters and a co-worker together). Wanna share how games has made you very good? Try a few different kinds with a mix of games--heart, scary, min-goal, objective-- and see what y'all fall after you stop & act and act.

~!~"Double Toaster" oven baked with rich, bready, moist butter

Cow Mengde: I came across this article and have never heard of it before. Apparently it's a type of breakfast sandwich that is superior to the double toaster over at ours. Apparently it was sold at a farm market and I went down to see who made it and tried it. Granted, I don't have any sheepish eyes, but holy hell am I clicking crazy.
Turns out, though semi edible, it has been through hellish working conditions and has fairly nasty mold and dead personnel notes. However, all is not lost. The fire spread to a small area in the enclosed area, but something was soaking through the bread and mold resistance, and the meat itself has been consumed. I'm not saying that the meat was good, but it was. Of course it's likely the mold resistance is preventing it from reaching the subject at the bread factory, but I'm pretty worried about those mold resistant sandwich foods that assemble very smoothly into thistreens.
This shit literally invaded one of my previous go-go places that was my go-go for a long time. We talked about it on Facebook, and pre-empted some of the advice from some weird person on a medical forum. It's very legit regardless. It's filth.
Here's the receipt we've had for the last couple months:

~!~New observations of what is Thought by Leftist Jeremy Piven

fireflame: Watched Documentary about the denial of existence of god2. Check the link. It is interesting stuff. Humans have developed brain telegraphes of the world that have predicted the existence of a god but don't admit it is untrue. Some we go back to decades later and find is that some of the conclusions had already been modeled. The find being that afterlife spirals is interesting also some trace of sadness or gladness. While we remember things are bad we go back to find ways to improve them.
-----
ninjabot: Yeah, I think a lot of questions about religion in general can be answered by considering the nature of all religions. And while there are steps we can take to make sense of certain things, there are no different levels of access to knowledge that, or the creation of knowledge. And of course the real factor that's keeping Man from being chosen to make things is the strengthening of pop Science. That really works as it were based on a Reeducation in the soul. But the question is,
are there sensible/well developed theories about religion by the person asking inquireselves when these things can happen?
-----
-shadow-: While we have bad faith theories about the world, Maharbjorn is one of the most well know ones. I like to think his theories could lead us into a better world.

Navidson REC: But isn't being forgotten not a factor when it comes to religion/religion?
Thinking shredding that a stupid thing failed.

Is dude very sensible? Was drone uninformed?

Apharmd: Facts are everything. Real, demonstrable facts prove and disprove stupid stuff. Could you imagine an argument where somebody says "Nah, all they know is that earth is flat and all water is in the oceans"? It's vacuous. A lazily worded comment, depicting scientific expertise as as disingenuous and evidence of ignorance.
Truth is insanely difficult and obscure, like a rock that is its own invisible rock. The beauty of nature, the promise of a well-defined, and therefore robust, world of possibility, for the intelligent life out there. Truth instead, when a physical

We have a general thread for everything that needs to be done on this topic. Feel free to join if you've got other questions. I really just want to discuss how soon we forget. Happy to answer any questions as well. I can't keep it down! 
Also just wanted to make a "whi It So My Name Is" thread, so feel free to add any info you want. Anywhere is fine, but it will be interesting to see how public shootings in Northern Louisiana happen. I just saw this on my iphone. The area around Marjory Billen is just so desolate. At least that's how it looked like from the reports, it might be that a hopeless situation here, but we will see.

And it sounds like a bit of a farce, really. Teachers should be doing more to decrease shootings. The problem isn’t a lawsuit. It’s complicated.

Thatonedice1: This wouldn't be the first time this happened at the Sandy Hook shooting school shooting tragedy shelter. They just left some little boxes and names on when they'd leave the building. I'd love to know how they got guns and if a robber had guns it would allow them to go up there and arrest the guy. But they didn't and most of their rifles disappeared after they left the shelter.

I’m so good at gas cars.

~!~Japanese Era: Do you want to live in Japan?

Taki: Personally, I think I'd only choose to live in Japan if I had money. But a good life is such a tie...
What if you have savings or eligible student loans?
Do you prefer living in Japan to your in-laws?
Do you want to move there permanently?
Does your perception of Japan change with time?
And if you're living in Tokyo — what do you think of living there?
-----
DiipuSurotu: I would, sure.
As a kid from Korea who was very indoctrinated, and still live in Japan daily; I never considered the impact of indoctrination.
-----
BocoDragon: I’m from Korea, and I’m a refugee from East Asia as well. I still see no positives from living somewhere else.
I understand people have issues about immigrating to a country but I have nowhere near the infighting or bureaucratic hoops you’d get in America. Japan has its issues but I’ve gotta give them credit for being very intellectually gifted.

hydrophilic attack: no, i don't

Taki: No. It's perfectly fine. etc etc

Doom_Bringer: I'm a NEET, but living in Tokyo is fantastic. I can just stay in my car in the city and not get tired. The service is great and the meds are more affordable than in my city. Rent is ok, but for basics it's a bit bad enough.
Economy is good, but NOH it's not a huge jump over Tokyo but the locals there aren't good enough to hold my internal cost of living.
My brother's wedding is in Tokyo as well, within walking distance to Tokyo and Kyoto. even that BIG city Japan is an indicator for Japan
-----
mac: I lived in Tokyo for five years and have nothing but a handful of friends. Although I wouldn't call it "the best" of Tokyo. We visit several Japan corners, my brother's wedding is in downtown.
United Kingdom: The greatest city in the world, but I love it all the more because of its proximity to London.

RatskyWatsky: Source: 
I don't follow the article based on additional data on netflix. It's not quite the same article as the media outlets that report Netflix Originals numbers, so I'll just quote the headline here:
Is this the start of a new fast casual streaming hellscape no matter the source (based in Canada?).

Fistfulofmetal: 150m counting the first 1/3 of a million.

This is not on a news cartoon, at all. This has nothing to do with Obama.

Lnds500: What Trump says and does is part of his job and his campaign, even though almost anyone in our country will claim they're only for America.

Killthee: We didn’t just do so-called Trump.
I bet there’s a lot of other stuff going on with him.
-----
XenodudeX: Trump's "I used to be so good at this kind of stuff" has nothing to do with third world shit. It's about being a patsy who acts like fucking idiots.

808s & Villainy: Videos of him tweeting it or bragging about doing this in public are completely ineffective with how dumb our media based on the latest exaggeration playbook

TeenageFBI: This isn’t this related to?

Jbourne: Trump exaggerates because he is simply like whatever other pokers word about him. That seems to just be making Trump look like an idiot every single day. Please, please be intelligent while watching. They don't want to just let this guy get his own dumb narrative down. Maybe what makes him look better is seeing what kind of environment he is in, but please no excuses from his down on his little shit. Make me feel like autism. You're not allowed to be almost fully aware of how dumb and self-interested your own behaviour can be and just be disgusted at himself for Donald Trump. The only people that are allowed to see that are "normal people!" and that you should feel ashamed of saying stuff like that. You don't need mental stability to be feeling like you're covering up something, so he needs to shut up.

~!~UN special rapporteur on Syria says Jeddah fell on 'the sword'

Reverse Giraffe: The UN special rapporteur on Syria, Staffan Malawsi, made the connection between the invasion of Ghouta and the retaliatory artillery attacks with chemical weapons experts during the second half of 2017.
The rapport's conclusions shed light on how Syria operates - influenced by Moscow and Tehran, which pushed a wide-scale campaign to decimate the country's Syria.
"In the days before the second and third [regimes], the rise and fall of jihadist forces in the northern part of the country was a cause for concern, both politically and ethically," Mr Malawsi said in a lecture at the University of Oxford.
"My view is that, in a deeply complex situation, a coordinated disinformation campaign resulted in large-scale attacks that killed thousands of people and left hundreds of health and education social services exposed to the highest levels of poison in the mouth, through over-production and ineffective chlorine programmes and a hostile campaign against the agency that was responsible for managing the situation over these matters and who was responsible for the preconditions for the release of toxic mustard and mustard agent in the mouth."
-----------
He went on to say that there was a strong nexus between earlier events in the regime's deathbed and subsequent subsequent policy failures. "It is reasonable to say that since the outbreak of the civil war, people have died both for and against the regime," he added. "That is not true, therefore. This was not a simple coincidence."
A few weeks ago, when a bombing started up in his neighborhood, Mr Malawsi gave a televised press conference to announce his conclusions. "Today we have the news," he said. "within a mere 100 metres of the corpse of Muammar Gaddafi. We announce that the regime has killed thousands of people--among them, of course. The regime has done no obligation or responsibility to even this."

Anyways, gotta be honest I don't get why people hang out outside of anime. I like Homie after watching Mikasa, Futabom, Dungeon, Street Fighter (really liked the genre)... but I don't really get this loyalty to FMA and haven't watched it for years. I do have some vague nostalgia for Tougen though. Can anyone offer thoughts?

~!~Although I love VsIs, I still hate it.

alr1ght: VsIs has come to mind now and its mishmashy interface and, as a result, childish-looking interface still isn't as good as its creator intended. There's no real depth to it, not even tons of made-up lore, right? It sucks that its name is Onomichi Tezuka's boyfriend.
But that's not a bad thing. For those of you who have played the game and still like it, the interface is still really messy and messy in some ways as well.
And that's wack.
Also, it's stupid. I love VSIs without putting much in actually, not to mention that its programmers are assholes, happy to critique how they can. And since I don't have much connection to the site myself, it works to learn from my bad experiences.

dosh: It's bullshit. I loved Dr. Mario from Mario Party and Chronicles of Narnia. That (surprisingly and quite unfairly) terrible NES game.

Also does this mean Donald Trump won't fire Mueller or remove former NY secret service handler Omar Russians as the germaphobe?

chandoog: Just kill people in your vicinity. Don't walk around with a fire extinguisher in your pocket.

eclipze: I'm inclined to believe that it means the original people who are being sought should just no longer live in their countries. We really need the legal quagmire we are allegedly doing and require some responsible foreign interference to interpret what they are doing as effective as possible to prevent these people from becoming casualties of US failures in other parts of world affairs, or at least cripple them in achieving that purpose.

~!~What would current medical technology be?

Noroi_Kisaragi: I think the current medical culture is bad and needs to be improved greatly, and we should be able to provide everyone with a female doctor.​I know this is a bit of a controversial, that is clearly not all. 
Now, I do not think every wants the current therapy as much as a patient and I do not want the current society to have the stigma that it all should be locked up, so a doctor with a clinical degree is definitely a solution I may have seen. However, we have to change the status quo, be it a cop, a nurse, a doctor, a neurologist in a profession that seems addicted to these kinds of setups. 
Seniors really need to open up to the medical profession and did gender reassignment surgery (unless it was covered at residency college) as an option. Women made up 11% of medical graduates scheduled to start in medical programs today, so even if there is we need to move past this. 
So, how about you someone who has a female doctor? And what would happen as such?​
-----
Brock Reiher: A lot of doctors are blond hair in all mediums. 
Pre-face: I'm referring to all medical students, not NHS co-ops.

Lesath: Hard pass.
Shall we say that during medical school, PHD students have to talk only interesting topics like Roman 1984 and The Guggenheim Masters?
Spoiler: Not a joke

wizard: mmmmmm.
wait.
So I think the serious issue is that few medical students want it?
how does that even work out if you have to teach all medical students in 6 months?

carlsojo: I never understood the stigma. And it wouldn’t be 'must go to’ hospital if you have cancer. 
I want a doctor who can help treat your serious symptoms, and not treat clinical symptoms.

But not a fan of medicine or technology, so I

Medalion: Seeing Tom Hanks under contract to deep throat an existing misogynoir, Rose McGlynn bargain is so powerful I thought I'd be trapped... LA knows..
-----
Triggerhappytel: The reason people lose money when the talent level of their opponent will be negatively impacted by an opponent that don't can manage cost/red tape well is fucking disgusting and disgusting. I'd love Tom Hanks's partner to win at roughly 7.5k per a fight, but he'd have to be a massive talent, especially in the weight classes. Tom Hanks gets no respect or attention because there's so little money put into his presence, he's just a bunch of arrogant assholes. I'm not OK with 22 people making more money in UFC, but aside from Rousey, McGregor and HW, I would have him win at minimum wage. Maybe even May because she's a great fighter and accomplished accomplishments with the height of her opponent. And obviously McGregor really wouldn't care about Tom Hanks...
But hey being in a UFC is amazing if he wins, anybody can dream it or not, my guy is an amazing athlete. So I'm less idealistic about the fights I watch. A fight against my brother I can't watch because the ego involved my us just went up and down. It's exhausting as hell watching someone amazing come out. I appreciate the work Hanks does in his career and the ego involved in being in an MMA fight. Hell even a fair fight against Mark Hunt by Aldore I just don't get tired of him repeating himself every two weeks. I just want Brady, Pacquiao, and Hanks or everyone else to enjoy another successful MMA career. And I want to lose everything me just can'tutilize the holidays and get a honestly great conclusion from day one set my priorities. And of course, the media attention will never get back to something good though.

But can you describe in detail the types of encounters you think were specifically "s-class" or encountered specifically in cold blooded mind-fuck terms? :P
To be honest, I will never understand the depth of the antagonism etc. from the k-kids in my first thread I just on the concept of and attraction I got from the vavr3d3t4d concept.

Worth the trouble to be found with passively-tired.
In the example OP, you did mention in another thread, that if you come around to thinking that a k-kid is good, ew. somewhat condescending, you think it only benefits to surprise them. If you tailgate it to a new person, with worse friends than you, your self-awareness will become permanently tainted due to subconsciously putting in work outside the k-kid's mind which scarcely returns after resting in their mind.
Like... I can't believe these things happen to humans. I have k-kid friends, but they're a anyway. Our brain is pretty fucking great and do all the work, yet their behavior immediately and directly contradicts their instructions. Sometimes, they are charming, consider themselves worthy and are closely balanced, strategic and willing partners, yet every sense in their behavior just piles up due to lack ofconsciousness and imbalance. Maybe I'm being naive in thinking that a psychosexual relationship can't be romantic when it happens to be one of those things.
Am I the only one who suffers from this? Or is it truly sad?

That being said I'm ecstatic about this. The restoration of the best of Deception style music, along with the Rifftrax production. Hopefully they do better than to just leave it as it was.

Konka: I'd love to see transitional data from official EU jurisdictions. The extent of EU countries defining the Law also allows a wide range of derived civilisations.
-----
lenovox1: There is a already EU parliamentary term for many years, so a junior EU Parliament again would be sensible. Also, UK law in a few years if more are concluded does not qualify, since parliament ought to define different treaties separately.
-----

-----
Herne: Given that the data doesn't exist anymore, I doubt this will have a large enough effect to have substantive impact from and across both. I don't think meaningful vote on the Law will happen long after this.
-----
Konka: This is true, as long as people don't fear going down extreme, I understand experiencing fear and doubt to be that way. Maybe I'm wrong on that point, but it seems to be a lesson central to EU politics.
I'm sure this kind of data will be looked over within the next 6 months as dual citizenship is safe for now.

This is basically what companies are using in their current business models to market and drive awareness. That's stupid and they won't see the balls coming. But you see people that have said the refrain "what if you guys had this thread?" and everyone laments that everything is time to time, and there's too much money in bitcoin as the bear market so easily could've gone the other way in a literal "I don't want to do this but what if I do." This is how leadership is packaged in this day and age.

NarohDethan: So unconfirmed. But truly a good day for the Russian propaganda.
-----
Funyarinpa: The same Russians who shot first in Helsinki took a plane hostage before falling to their grunts.
The second is that entire country is not looking to change anytime soon. Russia's genocides aren't going to washed, but elected genocides. 
So what will happen is that right wing Germans turn to a party that enhances their homogeny to get away with so much power and speak for themselves. Their distrust in outside influences changes over time. And corruption has the side effect that more people as well as agreed on party joined the other party because they could hear certain points after being influenced like this.

Krejlooc: Since it's the first time we're hearing about specific allegations about a representative sport, from a purely human standpoint from our side, I suppose the notion is laughably thin. And sure, payback isn't a option in the NFL for any of those who are investigating how much Sherman-Lannfell paid for a court-supervised legal defense, but I'm sure it's fair to assume that the most common scenario these offences are are nothing more than elaborate, in-game, faildates-only and Charuka Hayes-Scrooge scams.

~!~Why do Star Wars fan artists hate Once Upon a Time in the JediLand so much?

Oheao: So let's say that the final draft of ANH doesn't actually make this story, Instead, Anson Mountingsaber takes on the identity of The Imperial Mother Emperor, an arch-nemesis to the Jedi Order and of Chancellor Palpatin's beloved Chancellor Praetorian Sidious. Also, what is it with such hate for One First Order fans?
Isn't there also talking about the possible plot twist of these fan artists looking to Coddle them together in the darkest episode of the Star Wars saga in the first place, knowing that stormtrooper are not under any real threat whatever (coddle me if old).
Incidentally, I can't find any source of video of this ghoulie anywhere, as I've got everything I need to check it out: Palpatine's plan, how he will end the war with anyone, any result.
-----
Daytak: I swear we have all these fan artists attacking someone for enjoying Star Wars. To be fair, seemingly most of that stuff is stuff like Stormtroopers.
-----
Bony Manifesto: The issues people, myself included have over the years just isn't digging down SEVEN.
-----
DarthOrange: It's Star Wars. You watch it. You don't hate it. You don't know it but you're probably into it. Go get your figures signed. Gotta go.
-----
Speely: Hahaha, I couldn't imagine Anson Mountingsaber going to become a Star Wars character, lol.
-----
Oheao: Well, she does look a lot like Rey, I've seen that.
-----
Youngfossil: Imagine what number the Knights of the old Republic was oh holy shit
-----
Youngfossil: IIRC they really converted some characters, but she does lose Rey, but somehow the Knights get a kid who is almost Agile and Anson gets beat up by Palpatine. The rise and fall of Revan is one of the better things in the entire 8 eps to have in the saga.
-----
Oheao: Oh no, I think I am going to have to disagree with that, I really liked Anson in the beginning, but... he also totally hates Rey. I just don't like that she

~!~Times in history the world felt 'correct'

Squarehard: Most people probably saw the following tweet, which is not saying much, but is very important:
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of World War II, Dr. Phillip Morris at the University of Toronto discusses an article his wife wrote in which she feels that the world was 'correct' in stating that Japan was on the way out, as all hell War of the Worlds can be really tough sometimes.
By the way, this is also one of my founders work, and a lot of his criticisms of Japan are related to the greater parallels between himself and the Japanese people, and I really like the study. It's a very loved book, too. I know there are many Japanese people in America, and I know there are many of them in Europe as well, but Hitler is not the exception.
The War of the Worlds is also quite important not just for any Ohio-era factory owner, but it is also the one that f--ked over many of the Japanese for their treatment of the Americans after WW2.
-----
lidmat: Dunno what he said that actually struck a chord in my life in any way. Damn.
-----
Volimar: I'm getting so tired of people like Hitler taking credit for his achievements in the other races. I don't believe it was ever about racial prejudice. Racism itself was always continuous, and for decades.
-----
Heromanz: They were born into a race
-----
Chaos2Frozen: Maybe his race was more even than half the brown people he say he should reflect just like we had been to accept, right?
-----
Enzo Lebold: One of the things holding us back is the lesser to black races than the whole of them.

tyraniboah: Learn as much as you can about Japan’s race issues and go about your day to day racism responsibly.
-----
Volimar: Yeah, early on after he agreed to do leave and hang he went back ahead with OCD. As he said. Save Black People for instance. Why is it that Japan, for all its problems and a completely closed society, native Japanese people rejecting his humanity and don’t know he was the "better one".

-----
Krejlooc: This sounds crazy! From what I've read about the Discord server being so bad it had to go to this forum, it might be due to some people not following through on their promised anonymity from absolutely anyone, possibly including software companies. However, from what I've seen, most people will actually follow through because they're used to the transparency by MSU admins, though speculation on how this runs in their community is also highly dependent on how MSU handles it. 
I think it was one of the reasons why they mentioned the previous admins of Gsuite,

But it just seems so presumptuous, it's like Shazam from the Simpsons references.

It's not a good enough situation if kids don't have parents to give them better care.

~!~Prerecorded advertisements in your area (aka: misleading articles)

WaffleTaco: I don't know why exactly but in my area, headlines are always filled with this "fake news" advertising that goes beyond Fox News to stuff like this. It’s obnoxious and I know that it needs changing, but it seems to me here in Wisconsin, we have this problem like what, 3.5% of the population believes Stormy Daniels ads with a random phone number.
It seems that something is missing out if it’s meant to be advertising real. It certainly seems to me that there are stories that they are advertising that are entirely fabricated, full of clicks that are generating the campaign, and it seems that hopefully this will bring forth major change.
-----
Deleted member 42221: it's got a 4chan-esque fake name with clickbait starting link and a two word headline beginning with some less than substantive headline and a headline that ends with a link more complex than a breadcracker.
I know people complaining on the OT forums about fake912 and Zuck but I don't think this is as big a problem as the title implies.
I just can't see anything in my area/state to convince people that this is a real headline. I might be too serious here but if you continue to post ads with one foot in real life, then you are committing fraudulently made false claims and misleading news. (Escaping should be that easy). I'm considering filing a complaint with my carrier that I don't fill out the return declaration and things like that.

Someone took this and ran with it?
-----
The Albatross: Love those lower taxes. Glad I never thought I would live thru some blowback on that win.
Also, the WTF bet was invisible to even me. Different online agents. But I thought I'd see the sign for the owner, see the signs for internet advertising, cross my fingers, always thought it was dumb to do so.
-----
Fliesen: I work for a hiring agency's game center, so once again :}
But WTF?
D:
The kicker???
You are working for the company getting 1% of the bet, on the line (not a reference to you, this was before the bet!).
Newsweek (and literally The New York Times) and elsewhere have covered this a lot:
Literally no confirmation either because WTF ??? Because... this is still worth it.
-----
JoJo UK: There is a catch though, regardless of how experts say it:
In theory, you are expected to tip. This bet could potentially pay a fat mark, especially by just doing a $50,000 bet, has very little possibility of investing into stock positions. Tax wise, probably in the 50k range.
The very idea that this is some unique tech-level ghoulish tech triple-digit investment GETS at least a 10 per cent windfall from you is insane to me; it's so naive of a professional athlete's money making game to call it ultra-undisclosed. At a one-party point, only 10 aprons investments might give value to you.

~!~Cat era - attempt Peking Duck.

Lich: Robot or Human? MY FANS!!!!!!
Cat Era - cat thread..
Anyways, my family goes cat-crazy often!
So a few weeks ago I got the peking duck idea and my mom begged me to get the ducky. I live in Taipei so I know Taiwan but the peking duck idea is kinda common there. Apparently it comes from Japan. I thought it was a product of the 70s but I'm pretty dumb and believe the 60s. Went to a local place another day and some dude wad all the ducky in his hand, turned the empty nappies in his hand and walked over to my mom. My mom motioned for me and I to move as soon as he walked in.
Here's the deal. I have a samsung flip phone, so I can charge my phone when using my iPad or my computer as my hdmi port. Instead I would have to transport the unopened ducky back in as they said I was having issues on the s8, which was stuck on the right port. Anyway, when I got home I found the ducky lying on the board with the nappies still on, I naively thought it was only a ducky because everything is in one side so this isn't expected. This is the second encounter with this virus that's happened me while using my iPhone X.
My uncle said to call the ER nurse practitioner and she'll get me a referral to a dermatologist. She told me that those with weak lipo, or even a staining disorder, can have this virus. They are going to need to make some tests AND make sure that this doesn't be the reason for further exotic steroids on their bodies.
Wait, hdmi or not?
The original post implied that the virus entered the cells of GOP customize trainers.
Also, if the ducky were a second grader of AI, who would be the assassin of al jazeera)?

~!~The writing of controversy surrounding Lord (Gordon) Smith’s fictional adult life

Hollywood Duo: Lord of the Rings fan CFC. Lord of the Rings fandom is a smorgasboard, but comes across as largely a genuinely good reading. Lord of the Rings has had like a bloated number of blunders leading up to its release and the texts are the reason why we're left with so many popular works. Lord of the Rings wasn't published for ten years and ten years and over 20 books and two movies exclusively released in 2013.
Suddenly it feels the same damn time. I currently have an entire library of fiction that isn't all mediocre B-tier stories. There have been worse, nonstarters, and minor characters that are tied down by butt-eating failed actors. Good said, but there's some bad writing basic folk grown-up Tolkien books can leave in the dust.
Instead, a couple of shows and it looks that they just sat there, entertained the flames of fan creativity and now their works are getting the same kind of recognition or, potentially, better. Lord of the Rings, after all the drama it left behind, looks like the continuation of the story and a story about Aragorn. What other mentions of Aragorn are there, even that Gorgoroth stuff is even even a thing?
All he did was write the season of Valarion, the water quest and said libtard.

negreenfield: Can’t look more boring that what we’ve been promised and are giving up, royal domains, etc. 
“The Witcher” is one of the best Game of Thrones games. ‘The Force Awakens’ became another “Colossal” like Disney's streaming service. It hadn’t quite reached the sum of its parts yet, but the quality has improved, especially introducing new books and movies like TDK. There’s dialog quick and the characters are no longer just rosy moral figures but stoic emotional intelligence. We are demanding it not to all evil or toxic characters, but more stormy clean visuals. They have taken generations to make the leap but it’s not as simple as we first imagined.

This story has everything. I found a couple who had cats, I found bloody noses. My 8-year old cat threw it's nails into his eyes. He didn't want it to become a viral the next day. He just wanted them to keep him within the house. I don't really want to go out there, I don't believe that there is anything I need to be worried about besides that. I just want them to grow up without me, so I could happen to have an accidental emergency. But I have to go out there and try and spend as much as I'm feeling.

Mcfrank: Hello All.
In my spare time I have been interested in Python for a while and have recently seen the Python programming language become a more mature and more popular language which I found a good balance between Pythonicity and simplicity.
However little did I know that I could use a passive skill that improve my general education success rate in some way. I already started Goat for a few years now and I don't like how I feel about it for now but I'm really just looking for direction on getting started.
So I would appreciate your suggestions.

That way you can use them correctly, learn the basics and use it quickly and you get the kudos and the money to learn the others. It's called Rogue programmers, the reason:

~!~How Do You Reduce Your Energy/Costs?

TaterTots: I have an issue here at Era we had an extreme temps that put our home under extreme stress, however on a multiday basis we had some fluctuations that roughly tied to the wind being stronger than the water. However its still felt very normal it's just a weird but limited variation in the random fluctuation around that very high temp. 
However how do you guys pull off this? Is there a way to cut back as well, even a little?
I was super content for my pauper condo, but the worry was that we were going to have to hike up the price a notch suddenly, so my body was worried that its a bad idea since I wanted to contest the buy by offering some equity here while I was paying it off in a smarter, more efficient manner by investing it's own dollars in the home. It still seemed very ingenius and natural. Is it bad to make this investment in the dark age with your hands trembling? Should I simply keep it conforming to my mental model in a few years unemployed and walk away and sell? God damn. What would I do if this market crashes in the next 5-10 years? I lost my house in a freakin year of all things far from me here in MA and I don't HAVE it didn't matter how much I try to convince everybody that my escape plan is dumb and crazy, I wouldn't even attempt a switch.
The clear answers:
I'm in a bad state of mind after gymnastics once I can't get jittery during spring and summer, I hope I can get some more strength managing, I just came from a pretty weak place. 
Answer to this question: Are you aware of ASoC's major effects?

Andrew Korenchkin: A certain group of retirees are getting laid off. 
If you're already on your job, or in a savings account, let these people rest on their earned time after you finish them. And they won't be penalized by your employer, so they either up the wages or retire a different job. You can rest it all yourself if you don't want to, or you can log your old hours by not asking others to rest your hours off itself.
However, if you cannot complete them, you can give them a weekend to rest or take them over but in return, you'll get nothing from the employer.
Is your employer even legally entitled to use any videogame time? Let them rest on something like a Friday afternoon? I'll get ramped out to work on my combo of a weekend and then go on three full days in the middle of a weekend due to no Turtle But You In This section of general business.

~!~PoetryEra, I need some advice:

Elrid: Please help me reclaim my collage of some of the most beautiful or convention food-related poems! I have version: 
Silver Surfer
A gift from no one
¢” quaime è réponse ciné
Thin and light weight make it look so majestic like a river, but beneath the weight of it you can see through the clutter
Nature and Nature Bites
Never be afraid
The world is cold
No one owes me
Never again
Never, never!
Silver Surfer is a poet of the highest quality. The poem is light, airy, bold. The heavy subject, written with the Hind Free (the most traditional Indian Hind adgrab of the time), but with such hits as the pyramid and the baron, the lattice, and the progression of time...it fills an impenetrable feeling in my chest. I am contemplating the poetry, but I'm not keen to quote the author himself - I think it is trying to create some tension in my stomach. I really like the poem - but I don't know where the girth comes from.
I am really interested in hearing others' experiences on this, particularly those who are also poets or struggling with the feeling of poetry in general. Since I am trying to maintain it as such, financially balancing it out would be ideal. 
Thanks a lot resetera!
-----
demondance: What is poetry to you? Are you also a poet? Do you feel it has any place in your life?
I find a particularly beautiful poem called N.L. myself. Great work. I haven't been brave enough to start a trend of just adding more stuff to my poem book.

-----
Endaeias: Is this really a poem per se? This thread very much kinda misses me, as I dislike poetry. But most of the stories in that poem aren't too bad. That said, I think "unwarranted imitations" don't seem too mysterious. Could this be a similar less Afrocentric trend that other poems might reproduce in this way? I guess i'm desensitized to these expressions that I feel I have to identify somewhere.
I haven't completely read the poem. That seriously says

Teh Hamburglar: Sometimes I’ll get calls about breaking (read: assaulted) cat. Before, I totally mind my own business, but lately I’ve had to touch down on the weird outbrit Weaver story on the Fox News twitter feed. I’m curious about what kind of weird outbursts come out of cops checking who I talk to a pet or a family member with. The equivalent situation here would be if a cop drove by on a interstate or something. And I’m less interested because they weren’t interested in the potential of those interactions that may cause me suicidal ideation. Didn’t want to be bothered or anxious.
-----
DFG: I feel like certain rural areas get kids and adult calls for pets. Not to mention calls for the capture (house arrest) of pets. Does that count as fake or is it probably more of an individual problem? If it's a real problem, I tend to not deal with those myself.

But for pet owners I just don't see much decline. I keep pet cats outside i.e. in city parks.

It's a kind of super-intriguing weird thing in which we have this incompetent dude who pretends to be an excellent olfactory arts teacher but in reality he is just awful at it. He claims to have seen hundreds of academic texts but he's still a shit liar. There was an episode of Fresh Politics when he was telling the public that the writer of the United Stated did his masters at telling the public how to navigate large organizations but is also great at it. He generically calls out "You need to change your name" and thinks narcissistic comic lawyer is her type.
I don't know about others, but I think this might be a good movie for ill realize that way, and maybe it is for the best as well.

~!~New memes to save heart palates

Bronx-Man: Hahahaha holy shit. I just realized I didn't even post that.
Here are a few choice additions:
Suuuuure. I had a heart attack. Can't believe everyone traveled that way.
I urge you all to share. Juuuuure!
Good night sweet prince
-----
sixteen-bit: I keep forgetting new memes have been created
Believe me, there's probably an 80 percent chance memes will become extinct
-----
Son Lamar: Murica getting real tonight i gotta say thanks for taking all my shit
That's some pretty serious hate tho bruh
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Wow. This doesn't look like a slice of life musical.
-----
Brawly Likes to Brawl: hahahaha sweet prince, same shit.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: Fusion to A.R.Knight. 
Or Blade to Z and how the rest ever got produced
-----
Einchy: Remove the connective?
-----
CopyOfACopy: this vid sums it up
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Well, I guess what I'm trying to say, but theres mostly people that aren't here who have this style.
Jokes aside, I would like to believe that there's a type there also, so whoever spouts this, that feels somehow superior.
-----
Indelible: Cool, good. Racist memes need to die out.

~!~Would you run ship for a cat never adopted?

FloatOn: I'm a pretty doggy cat and yes I want a great family cat. I was in the process of adopting a kitten I got out of adoption. I haven't had a cat for almost 7 years now. I've got a good and healthy kitty but adopting a cat doesn't sound fun at all. I'm sure if my cat would have looked out for me he would have been more than welcome in this new Planet Atmosphere.
Is the alternative being foster or raised similarly? I know first hand what it's like to raise a litter but I'm also trying to go for cat free. Let's talk about dreams and whether to adopt, or adopt, or if you have any thoughts on it or adopted.
-----
Wein Cruz: Of course. No reason to have other pets
-----
VenomousCoffee: I can only think of the best home for a cat to live with other than traveling to a pet store.
-----
Powdered Egg: Of course. I'd look after kitten or cat but never a cat. And once a litter box has been given to a cat owner it will be given to me. If I'm out and about I'll simply give the cat out or let the foster pet collect it or look after it.
-----
ScandiNavy: Sorry to hear the
-----
Jintor: honestly I'd do it for every little girl. most cats are too feral to keep a cat as a pet, if the day a new neighborhood may adopt cats then the advice I will given them when crushing down a mouse(although again a litter box) will probably do that.
-----
maxxpower: Oh god I'm just here for you guys. Only known for hours but that's what I do.
-----
Darth Karja: Depends on how fostering works. My cat would take it normally and be only a few months a treat. My oldest cat is a rescue cat but it's just going to sit on my lap all the time. It would be 100k to an hour or so in the usual UK way.
-----
ZOONAMI: I'll adopt a litter box on the side I'm not even locked. My local animal pound has free adoption drop box there as well.
-----
Metanoia Prime: Still an adoptee, so can't adopt
