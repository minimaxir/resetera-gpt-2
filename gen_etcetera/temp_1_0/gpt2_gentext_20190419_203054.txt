~!~How do you deal with stress of becoming responsible (on the rock)

Cochese: On the morning of 9/11, I had a big morale thing going down. I barely had any general attitude. Any self-inflections to avoid, even better thought off a minister who was going to recommend more toys and buttons. I worked at a moving company and we added over 2,000 workers, an increase than any kind you've seen in 2120 years.
I started freaking out more and tried to start venting less and less. I preferred going to malls or pawn shops. Dive bars were not a good spot. Other places like museums felt front and center. Interestingly the regular people at the clubs looked far nicer without just going to friends house (or club), but it was also rare for them to be in the clubs.
The problem came when those people started to lean more far and far conservative on the socio-political shit I was doing not so I called narcissistic. My parents were looking at Facebook groups of people who are hyper hyper excited about the constant expansion of their circle. My mother was also desperate for a boost, and was having panic attacks because my computer was malfunctioning because of my constant crashes.
I'm starting to change, but having finally gotten enough therapy, I'm saying what?
"Watch your mother die real soon, they're some scumbags."

~!~Trump: Russia didn't want us to know about Syria attack...

brainchild: This is not about Trump wanting the US to let (inter nintendo) know in advance if we would allow Syria to become another war zone, it's about wanting to have blindsided Russia via constant "spoiler" play that this will only worsening the situation, and absolutely we shouldn't let nations like Russia know about things like this while letting them slide into other countries' worlds biggest pond, like Japan and France. In fact, some western countries even have frankly even started to warn most of us that Russia's attack was pre-meditated, and "short-sighted".

I think lawyers should take what they can get, but if there's anything available to me I would like to get it fixed, but I don't know if they'd want to adopt a system where they have complete blindsiding to faraway and "failing" to intercept the missile over Europe.

~!~Switching to the iPhone 6 & iPhone X (pictures not mine)

Chrome Hyenas: As a mobile user, this sucks. I've been eyeing the following new phones - Google Pixel 3, Samsung Galaxy S8, OnePlus Wireless 5.1, Google Pixel 3 XL and Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and I'm torn - I don't want my data caps to be like 1GB a month. I have £1000 a year ticket waiting for me, what do I do? Raise my bill? Same question as others - about for downloading because I don't need WiFi there's plenty of options

but was the Pixel 3 XL an upgrade for the S8. Or is the trade in some mini upgrade?
-----
StealGaius: Maybe well not S8+ - but I wouldn't mind seeing the Pixel 3 XL or S9 if they come out too.
I bought about $900+ in 2013 and that's in 2011, so only got a GSM plan for like 5 years old because X1's wifi could cut fat otherwise. Just throwing away SIM cards doesn't make a big difference.
-----
Scramblethink: I got a galaxy s8 smurfx exclusively for the price. The trade in program was a year ago now if you plan on buying another phone. I also got a zp3 for about £350 including tax.

The Musou series feels like its MOST intresting as what even they goofed out for other silly games and this is no different no ? a jetpack style hair can still hold up to the 100k people that didn't can imagine how great that series was. However every major change and gate it back seems to have been that a soft period.

It more akin to gundam some people claiming it was a hard period just like the real Saint Seiya

They give 100 dollars to a company to do, which then reinforces that you want to spread the message and spread hate so much that you know if you do this survey why someone is doing it to you.

~!~Do reload videos work?

shnurgleton: Any decent brands/fetishes/techniques that you feel can help with this? For example, reload videos allow you to quickly go to 1 close a shot video with almost nothing happening in between. In that case, I'd get the 90s blaxploitation mixed in to smooth stuff out. 
Do you think there's a video function, and if there is, how many of you get this day/night cycle?

Yerba_Sutra: I'm a bit of a 90s/early 2000s millennial - I don't really have anything profound to say except why you never ask unless you're deliberately spending time disturbed

-----
deepFlaw: Just showing me the video icon on the camera app makes me want to reconnect.
Just prompts you to make it back.
-----
Mulciber: A reload video is, at the very least, a seamless high-def stream, unless you want to ask the channel to re-render your video (which is often not the case).
I'l make a reload videos playlist, pause it, and basically reload every other video involved if I think that's a good idea.
-----
shira: Does what you are trying to in tlwwl and cant really afford it dont ruin it
The way I see it when doing I will re iPresent in the ad space.
But maybe reload videos can, maybe that should be a requirement for every app/book etc to offer a free service instead of a subscription.

Most video play is done on the player, so you have a player that you can pull any content from, like Hulu, Netflix, HBO, stuff like that. It depends on the player where you play the xbox controller, but usually your player will cover all your other content under the same stream of data when an app/movie is open. 
That said, if trough a YouTube Red or other apps you feel that you're having trouble with connectivity, or if your internet connection has been slow down, run through a router-type program, and/or SSID, like Comcast or HU,

Wag: I'm on a two hour day train ride from Atlanta to NYC. So I've had to make up my time of 30 and I can't really plan a lunch up.
I started my job way last week and took a living stipend despite counting vacation days since I live in NYC. The job also has more frequent intermunitions. Doesn't matter sadly.
So what can you do? I think stopping from 4 or even 5 circles would be a good starting point, especially if you have kids. Nothing too difficult if you sleep in indoor tent.
I'm forced to work 36 hours a night both on the train and at home and 6am, 5pm classes must be 1 minute long. Sure, it's not perfect, but for 30 hours total I'd never want to visit family members' house.

~!~A white woman scared the shit out of me almost 5 years ago

Deleted member 1258: I have the most profound/frightening read on anything now ERA. WTF did I just read?! Her brother picked her up from the airport like a quarter pound of cocaine, told her why she was so weak. She pulled him back to the car, told him his name was Elliot and then told him whose name he picked and generally told her who he was following from Wikipedia:
Also she hasn't found an abusive husband yet
She's made me study up on getting out first aid and her mother dead, so that's pretty unprecedented, even when nothing serious happened. But then that scared me too. Whenever she talked shit on the bus around me, me and her just took it in stride. Her video story of how she had to deal with that train threat made me think of that woman: maybe that woman is afraid for her life just because she was born black. I had feelings, but then after she unplugged it, I legitfoundout what she did was criminal as fuck. In the interview she tried saying that she thought she knew the woman, but when she looked into the video from the sidelines, her face completely took on that fake "lone wolf" face and then she ran right into a person. One of the other guys at the grocery had nothing on his footage and this fucker was telling me shit like "Man, you guys! I got you good." and was smiling like some genuinely amazing person.
But damnit they kept making her stories for ages, so I guess there's the general sad reality of life. She's already been through a lot, and she hasn't recovered like she did. I just wanna say I'm sorry she had to go through all this pain. Shit is scary and I much rather them not to have the burden of knowing for so long. It sucks that I mentioned just a little here that my relationship was going down for the loooong time, but in the end it all came crashing down and I never thought it would affect me that much.
-----
Gugi: She's in a tough amount of happiness right now with all the hardships she's taken, but she has one among a series of seemingly amazing things she's done or plans to do the rest of her life.

~!~Has anyone tried Spandex Make-As?

Truant: Just bought some last night...for once. I wasn’t crazy about it, but I didn’t expect the thread.
These make-as are way too thick for a normal dinner, which is absolutely ridiculous. If a normal person had these in their life, I would eat it whole, not just make some extra thin sliced icebergs or extra large Cheddar cheese.
Did it right when I ordered? I think someone cut a number of other shits but Spandex make-as were extra thick and didn’t glow quite as much. It also has weird contours to it.
How in the world has anyone at all tried these? There’s one guy with these in my circle, I think he’s still got it. And I love the ringwrapped bottom, but it’s so addicting. Also, the rang are thick.
Who else online has tried these? Or anyone actually trying these?

The Albatross: I've done both. Had skimpsack-style shapes in glasses, a GQvissea tape on top of these... kind of gross, but I think I liked them enough to get $100 for 3 or 4 because I wanted to keep front of the bar.
Had a bigger size that a $200 LG "gundam" that I was working with, a little easier to keep the same shape in the front (or in the background). I think I've tried making the wavy shapes better (better shape with less smudges) but I can't remember what I rock.

~!~My pasta is maize. How does it turn out?

julian: I made something like this from scratch. I put spaghetti in rice, chorizo, corned beef/deep fried beans and some sort of flour. Gluten free option. 
The thing the issue is is, the outer shell is fluffier than spaghetti. The noodles, of course, sit flat and require more heating to be done. The noodles get thicker and get a bit dry. How should I do it? What's going to be done? Lol
-----
The Real Jeremy: Using extra cooking oil. Making pasta is less of a financial issue than pastaBeans. You probably need 10k dried glauzer or 12k pax. Growing old is time for a different kind of pasta.

Blue: It cooks faster. You still need more weird pasta recipes. Individual things that get you started? Things that after years of eating can be tasty? If it tastes slightly different you'll have time to make a tasty recipe. I actually built a pasta pot for once, but needed less money to do more).

Beyond pasta and rice, I don’t have a clue exactly how to cook it. On the surface, the rice/beans should be covered in water, but rice and beans or whatever else is still needed. Do you know what else is needed? The flour, salt, and baking powder I take. Then the flour, salt, baking soda. On the same procedures I make a seared macaroni.

~!~Please provide a source for the names of priests accused of sexually abusing priests. 
This is just a small sample. Please try to provide at least links (like, direct to articles) if you are interested in naming priests that were sexually abused.

Bacon: I believe if a person is sexually abused the reporting must be direct. The only exceptions being if the accused politician or a minister are directly involved in the abuse themselves.
Anyway I'm going to get myself in hot water with this instance today. Report my brother, he was only 17 at the time, and was clearly unaware of what was going on. Talking directly to the accused politicians first. Had he not been aware that his doings were put in jeopardy then the accused is able to blindsided?

NoKisum: Why would anyone defend those monsters
On topic, get an independent priest that takes the side of the accused in situations like this....

Not Spaceghost: Holy shit. Disgusting.

Hollywood Duo: This. Anyone that defends or enables these monsters deserves to be locked in a room for the rest of their lives.

~!~I may be getting fired, but it seems like a lifetime for me One Piece is an expensive hobby with me being inside forever (and I'm learning)

Uzumaki Goku: I'm not always straight with my plans lately, so every SoFday has been to find someone to prop up my itenial, be it a college student, or marines, or some other jackass, or just really nice people, but all I got thinking today was me spending like 20-50 was giving a presentation on my IT Systems at school with no non-presentation that at least gave off a *freshman vibe* and seeing good people to sample it from there. I went home, cried, and ate food. Today was going to be my last day at school & today is as well this day. So I've basically been working tomorrow onIT & it's IT assignment.
I guess I got my thinking through this that I'd like to impart. My English is what I consider decent and I have pretty good disposable income. That's like a payday for me since nobody wants to talk to me.
How would you fare if you made money on some IT related venture, or did you go out to basically just learn from others advice and get a good paying job?

Rackham: Did you ever hope to have that money to invest? You'll walk away with just enough cash to handle loans and rent.

Jesse_and_the_rippers: I did this, when I was 21 and was a student there. Propped up $100k after high school by doing research at a small bank & investing for some nuts. 
Did it for a $12k pay period. Then dropped it when I got a contract for life within a year.

ginger ninja: This is on my personal but if I had $50k go to mars.

~!~An hour and a half a week go easy on the OCV logo on the TV / Laptop monitor is killing me

ElectricBlanketFire: Have a headache:
Presented at a Tampa Rays game, during the hour two a day, no smartphone being displayed.
Also a 12 hour "tech" session.
The second session is scheduled to wrap up early on Wednesday but doesn’t start until Saturday.
Effects of intermittent internet/Wi-Fi running?
I’m willing to watch as just one person won’t have downtime - if I don’t sit down and control my whataburger taste I still will never give it to anyone or give it to anyone.
(Edit: 
I don’t think I could function shitting on the TV, it just burns me from an occasional belly squasm every single time. I still get shit for my hatred of Fox Sports' scheme of zero hours. Like 50% of my movie watching says nothing about anything else, but something about wasting my time an other human is free to do what they are / doesn't waste time. Not bollocks. I really should make that exception something genuine and commonplace. That’s just my quirky affable personality a person should meet...
Seriously, if someone cares as much as me doing one-on-one stuff - will make a world of difference.

Piggus: I think prototypical perfection would be to not have one person do all the work as opposed to putting your hands anywhere unless you need them. Shows respect to that experience, often means sacrificing yours due to a personal desire to preserve the location of whatever “table'.
Otherwise, how people do is super easy as what’s an hour, doesn’t have to involve much. Even if you like your piece of tech, a full-time programmer should be able

~!~I think, Bad Game, sucked bad during its original run

Haunted himself: It was a given Wolf Alice would do the work again.
I admire the impossibly talented artists who have accomplished so much here in this world.
There is now a new Alice that is nearly an even better version of Bastards.
Blue Shift happens!
John Wayne, Sherif Roots and Camilla Lucknott (the horses) make me PISSED sad when they're not even mentioned.
So much goddamn art too, that sounds amazing. That's the treasure they've been sharing and no more for today as I can't watch these icons.
They're nothing like Alice again?
-----
jph139: Sounds like it almost didn't really age well - though it's interesting cuz playing age-based fantasy works like Abel Asante, Cabaret, and Silmarillion kind of missed the mark on being fantastically extraordinary. Anything than what I imagined became the remnants of a golden age, though it's maybe a bit rough today.
As for the art itself, yeah fine. A lot of it just had to be machopped in the shit too and still looks nice today. The aesthetics are t

PhaZe 5: Looks fantastic now.
I know what others might like. But they're usually in the minority.
One thought.

Thunder: Wolf Alice could still hit some standard Liszt stuff for visuals... But I expect another classic Hearts Maiden era to come out at some point :P
-----
NameUser: Sounds like a classic. Missing the neices.

PhaZe 5: It definitely is from the moment Rafaello from Paris did it- but it starts on the women in pictures here!
The art though is amazing. 236 illustrations! This older one I couldn't really buy OP? I was thinking a Magic card table or Draw a Poker!
If we go a bit further back in time, some of the works are available. There is one book

FaceHugger: Holy fucking shit Wolf Alice really was overlooked as it's role in biggest genre book Bands of Misery is among the greatests paintings of all time. The paintings were incredible!

But yeah sounds like some pretty fantastical art. I'll give it a go

In a universe without A.I. d a balance, how edgy will we all be? Will people which way to interact at homosex or will they just pick up the bicep in order to throw away their original sense of self? Will we all learn to love and care for our POTUS, or will we all become charming or dastardly helpless?

Squarehard: Does this paper solve other problems with the universal "woman's bodies don't have legs" stereotype? (The article does the opposite, I think, they just put a lot of effort in to put those stereotypes in)

PancakeBurglar: This is so absurd.

Deepwater: even if all it published was more conservative news, that's still a rather objective thing to do
the new research was released but it uses opiod as a strawman, while their paper relates to something in the US and the many issues with literal men raping women
what gives?

NewsBlacks, an information service run by the UN, sells off Israeli properties to farmers as "theaters", sold off as combatants. But are they wrong about the significance of that practice? Allowing people on foreign soil to live like civilized people, even if they are not on one villa, should be both gross violations of international law.

Kazura: We have 'very dark' light versions of that on like its own but I feel it's getting too drab over here, especially the part of the brain on the side of the head that gets darker the more light our brains are getting.

Ether_Snake: It does have an effect on the other way around. When we do this, our natural light is getting absorbed by the brain which then affects our vision and also our form making.

It certainly sounds like a film though...
-----
emag: Bumblebee needs a remake.
-----
Daffy Duck: When I think these books are lit, they are such a jarring and forward-thinking disappointment.
-----
Terminus: I came out of watching the movie the other day in a place where only Bomb is a thing, and while neither of these films felt direct-to-video, there were a few that ended up becoming straight-forward movies and the bits they each added were pretty great.
If you can get a bomb flick with an original production value, you've got a golden opportunity to take the boat.
-----
Ethical Hedonism: For as long as the Reboots have been out there I would believe this. It needs to be integrated, and fundamentally changed as standard in anything that feeds into the films. Without I don't know about the current blu-ray distribution systems, but the huge and hubris is silly IMO.
However to non-believers: Imagine the eyes of legend Tom Hanks in this.
-----
emag: That's the justification this came out months after its release. Same deal with how Detective Pikachu is the Q8 box office chace, etc.
-----
jett: Like a film, while it's still a few years out, it still needs a remaster. The originals were dope though, while the remastering is pretty dumb.

Helio: Oh, something about the bombs. They make a film like 1000 movie releases, boom. Now make a 90s movie that lasts 1000 years.

Shedinja: Been watching a bunch of his videos lately, and as someone who also struggles with heat, this has really stuck with me. The final episodes hit harder in wet seasons. Seems like every month or so there's a new episode figuring out how much water is needed for the spring/summer heat outside.
Did some math and heres a range above which it would change his score.
Anyone else been in CA heat recently? Is this gradual or is it just not worth worrying about the water
-----
Dennis8K: It is true that the summers in Houston were more scorching than the ones in Chicago.
In Chicago I stayed inside for a bit my whole life and it did not rain outside for like a week at all. It just seems like the seasons have picked up in the last couple of months.
Presently the water in Lassos are going to be hand boil on all of the pans. It also just seems like that the cells in the interior of Lassos are melting and are melting (can still see part of the pan in the timeline).

tommy7154: I don't pay any attention to science but I noticed in some videos that Fofau being boiled doesn't make anyone's lives better 
But not to bad, I went to a movie and a science channel made a real documentary where the house was boiled over and all the effects of the process were shown onscreen. So I'm not sure if just pure coincidence or if the numbers actually reflect real world experience.

~!~Sentai Filmworks to Weekly Shonen Jump

hughesta: News
Via Crunchyroll
Sentai Filmworks (known as CR is best-selling manga magazine) will be publishing the following series in Weekly Shonen Jump:
The Whale
4-5/Emo. (hardcover) volumes
Grandia
2-4/Weekend Shounen Jump (normally collected by Comixology) cross-over, which is probably good but smells silly to me (fuck it, I might as well just buy that)
Hit Him Up
2-4/Month Shounen Jump
Mirai
3-4/WiiU Shounen Jump
And all good stuff, but some older stuff and apparently not Rising, which seems weird to me, and Orichimaru must be the weird shit that happens when you go into a publisher's website, which I also don't understand, seems to have something to do with titles that appear in weekly Shonen Jump.

Pai Pai Master: This sounds like it's subject matter as usual.
-----
PSqueak: Wew lads.
I wish they'd bring over Chihiro Sudo.
-----
Mesoian: Yep, that's them taking over Jump Girl.
I'd imagine this means it's going to get a few big events.
-----
SecretFire: That already covered it, who put that out there? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat

SENPAIatLARGE: Might as well just piss off Deku and company.

Richter1887: 1000 words was enough for me.

IMACOMPUTA: Yeah, I'm buying this. Hope it's better than the Chihiro series I was seeing for months.
-----
sir_crocodile: I guess this is a nerdy thing? Does the web-saga thing fall into the normal realm?
-----
SolidG: It may look like it's a bit crazy, but 
Sentai's original Japanese manga running for just 2-3 years starts 25 issues a week for probably the most part. So if monthly runs aren't regular now, that probably means they'll drop that after a year or two I guess.

theofficefan99: For those of us who dont know, Dark chocolate has a lot of different types of tastes.
There are different kinds of dark chocolate, e.g. Camp Gold, White Chocolate, and Then Original.
There is also different varieties of chocolate, Origo, Cheesecake.
Anyway I was wondering what type of chocolate it is - I cant decide how my favourite chocolate makes me feel (and my all time list is :o)
edit: Also to narrow things down, I dont like ice cream :o

hjort: It's an acquired taste, too.
Go for chocolate alchobars.

~!~About my Aetna Fraud: Inside my insufficiency in giving my spouse an Xmas present.

JoseDFrog: So Ive finally identified my problem and got the presents when they arrive. Aetna is a telemarketing company that promises a lower cost of solutions based on your spouse’s needs, but I count my experience working on their payrolls as a downgrade to an annual fee. So I’ve been paywalled the Xmas present to the barber. Before reading this, my wife was born about a month after, so this will be my first time paying T/N today during Christmas! With a tax issue, this is there 3 tags on my credit card. One for the Xmas present, one for money saved to get me rid of the job, one for losses that are never reimbursed during my work, and one for "My name is Dr. Hillbilly and I am Shining" like a marketing trick. This is my name as the credit card number of the Social Security Administration. The Xmas present that I’ve noticed is a comforter with a middle child behind it, so I got this on Christmas Day as a present and checked out to get it on the front page. But my family icon doesn’t show up, so I’ve got to manually change the background color to avoid any potential parent scamming.
Idk if my credit card will ever get rid of this thing because of this being my family, but I figured as long as I never hear any of this again I’m good. Anybody be like this?
-----
Rektash: Your correct, I'm too paranoid about republican snitches to ever get my name off a list. I mean, there's good that can only be hidden. It's not like my employer is some tree branch cop who cheats about tech support.... I just got that off this site because you all. He's a dictator though.

~!~Ships displaying US State Flags have been removed from all US listed listings

Schreckweg 5000: MOD EDIT: DISPERS WILL BEErased Upon Request
Use this site to search for ships that aren't currently listed at some point, or by searching for USA and Spotify links.
This will limit US listings to only the ships that show the US flag. For example, this one ship will be displaying the US Flag on the side of all listings, not just the other related items.
Unlisted listings may still contain the ship and items that show the flag of the United States of America.
This is still ongoing the old forum's policy on this stuff.
-----
Jarrod38: Not sure what happened.
-----
Big-E: Merry Christmas everyone!
-----
Chandler: Doesn't that happen quite frequently on lists today?
-----
Cocolina: Uh, good grief OP. What are you getting for $5?
-----
Spine Crawler: can we get a mod to remove that link?
-----
Cocolina: I don’t know, it probably would. But we have enough small listing threads for all of them.
-----
Jarrod38: Oh, I see that. I'll look into that
-----
Aquavelvaman: lmao happy holidays!

Arcana OP: Is the list not dead yet? All the isles in nanta are going to be ridiculously ugly!

~!~Father killed his 2-year-old son outside his New Hampshire home, offering $18,000 to help build a wall.

Coyote Starrk: I am heartbroken. Grown ass man covered his mouth and denied the facts in a very convincing lie. This is not the America you want to be. 
This god damn scum. This is messed up.
-----
Westbahnhof: I wouldn't characterize siblings for not being able to go out to dinner as having the same deficiencies. Abusive, obsessive mother. I'm not sure how people in abusive relationships can produce the same highlights.

FireSafetyBear: Maybe the dad was some kind of collaborator?

You would think someone would thing that for all sanity has dictated to me that perhaps fathers were better off being outcasts than murdering people at an off a stages, instead of their peers.

~!~WaPo: The election of president of the United States is now fake as hell

KSweeley: Here's some major news, WaPo is reporting that Trump won the election and that the election is now fake because the Democratic Party in the U.S. is corrupt.
The WaPo article below has some additional information: 
A few of you might know this but I would recommend checking the full article and not just posting this one link:
-----
preta: I am sure some of you survived the 2016 U.S. election, but there is no power in the people for you to protest if you aren't hyper-vigorous trolling campaigns.
Did you?
-----
ruggiex: The GOP and gov't who run a poll is saying some stuff about working-class, minorities, with Mueller in charge is kinda nothing. Or I am being sarcvicky.
-----
Coyote Starrk: What great news all of this is! This feels like a better summary of how Trump is making complex, US politics more palatable than it has any right to be. I was hoping to see how it goes.
Edit: here is a better summary of how things are getting politicized not so much Hillary but Sanders made it obvious who he thinks he is too. Not properly highlighted however is that the process of bureaucracy/fraud being presented to the American people is sort of shady.
-----
Turtleboats: Well, we have to hope to not burn down our own thread. 
I fucking can't wait for this.
CNN and any sort of network "news" should be loosing their relevance and fanbase since this is really exploitative for the middle class and the abortion vote was the least talked thing to get through.
-----
ianpm31: That's one way of putting it
-----
Atenhaus: That's honestly scary.
If this thread gets too thin then advertisers have to literally pull out polls they don't even have to publish. Total shit in this country.
-----
riotous: We can't waste our money on fake news on the internet ;-)
-----
1.21Gigawatts: This reminds me of This Is Us, aka the Shane Carr thread. This one page thread takes place all the way back in early November, which is how something constructed could clearly get derailed as some sort of dispute around a premature announcement of Kavanaugh.

~!~Henry Cavill Will Star In ‘Respawn’ Based On Humble Romance

RastaMentality: 
-----
BigLongJohnson: Guess I'm the exception. Guess best of is.
-----
Camwi: I'll have to find a more qualified writer for a CGI biopic, because Cavill can suck.
-----
Penguin: Think it's a cloud Humble rom-com, to believe it.
Cavill doing a "Joker" biopic sounds better than the writing would suggest.
-----
Widdle Puppy: And yes Nailed it.
-----
Hesemonni: No I don't think, I would love something like this.
Do gay romps since the 70s are a thing?
-----
geomon: Nice, we should know some non-hetero-normative genders for women. My special vehicle is going to be Nailed My Teen so that I can be fat again.
-----
RastaMentality: I like how he takes it to another character. A cast of characters and setting almost as much as Cavill.
Milo is just a character insecure at being invisible, it's a role if not a threat. Does his friend Joker the one on Superman's team? Do Cavill and Cavill have the same weakness? Probably Nic Cage.
-----
GotMineGood: Nothing against play of cards, but I wouldn't be shocked if Cavill from the pilot doesn't turn into someone in the movie.
-----
Aselith: Well this could be cool

~!~REPORT: "Dragon Ball" Is The First U.S. Version Of "The Lion King"

ManaByte: 
-----
SolVanderlyn: Dragon Ball is a series that no longer has a US audience
-----
NarohDethan: How about no.
And yes, it's just a kids' show, which means it's not kids entertainment in the same sense that the first Dragon Ball has been.
No, people have decades worth of access to video games and anime
-----
Luminaire: Yes. This is what getting a U.S version of Dragon Ball is like.
-----
Dennis8K: Are you actually still going to Dragon Ball?
-----
Daytak: Nah
-----
CampBuddy: I dont know how to respond to this reply.
Also
No
-----
Sho_Nuff82: There doesn't seem to be a universal cultural translation for Dragon Ball, so if there is no script for the TV adaptation, there's software, possibly, for the film.
Dragon likes to show the audience what Japan has done already - to be Japan's multimedia and also a major stake in entertainment. LOVE that it's getting a portrayal of the US.
-----

LifeLine: Your post seems off topic, but do you think Dragon Fitness Van Saga - which is reminiscent of Dragon Ball, is the first videogame version? 
Its gorgeously colored with letters written in like 1984, the USA, and China 
The game is complete, just notchless, and supremely beautiful imo.

I'd rather they had guards out trying to keep them from committing political suicide of course.
-----
Zed: What was the NRA doing 70 years ago?
-----
Suz: So there's also a german Neo Nazi party?
If that makes people happy I'll never be able to see myself identified as neo Nazi
-----
Brandson: As long as people won't use those young people as funding sources for what is now the Russian party, then fuck them.
-----
efyu_lemonardo: Damn...
Yes maybe the era of the GOP since Reagan had one shining star.
I'm asking but it might be too late on that day, I felt something something injustice
Every time someone like Fox does rub it together at the NRA org is forced to a small point and literally kicks them off a invention.
-----
criteriondog: They sure did. The vets did too!
-----
shnurgleton: This is just good cause they keep on giving

~!~I just had an epiphany

bar_bar12: I have so many questions. Mainly about my ego and OCD and what I should do to fix it. So make sure you are in the right place OP. Worry, admit you were wrong and act serious. Am I the only one at this point trying to fix everything/changing my life?
-----
AlsoZ: How did you go about fixing your life? Have you tried psyching yourself out?
-----
tintskuecha: Talk to a therapist once you have a good one in your life to order some things. Then get a notebook and get yourself out there with the motivation to ask some questions and to learn from it.
-----
teruterubozu: Two truths:
1. Fix without asking or expecting compensation. I'm 31 but have had the anxiety and panic attacks of my early teens because I was told very little about when the drug did happen. I felt very disconnected from my body and brain. 
2. Be positive, be calm in your own self-interest. Other issues should work out.
-----
potam: Therapy, see how you're feeling. Seek professional help, yeah.
-----
Platy: Are second-life resetters a thing? Sometimes, at its most basic, there is a symptom of the present moment that one deals with.
Happens to me that the symptoms of a certain "thing" (depression) are present for a long time and that i am not one of those things, i suffer and passed the point of no return.... or this "life is destiny" kinda bullshit (or it'll affect me but I won't be there.. for now)...
Those things will slowly make you decent for a while. (depression sucks and makes deep thoughts, dig it out with the motivation, one day you get one day's warning. Takes years to really get going, and you get comfort - but so does healthy eating, willpower etc.)
Not worth the some way to get one day's warning. It is a waste of time. You just wait unfortunately. 
It can take a while.

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: Dude that's a bad look. Over over.
Thats what when I'm a week on a thing and i end up not feeling well. Give yourself time to find sorts of things

~!~Faith or I'm dead

Creation_Scapes: Just stopped by FB, finally checked my messages, saw this line by one girl, "Religion is real and unwatchable for many y'all. Ask them, do personal inquiry. Totally get it. It won't shut you up man." 
As in, "Religion is fake and an attempt to reason with animals." That's what I thought to myself when I first read some of these..... What do the people here think is going on that says, "Religion is real, is a tool for people to question if that, is having knowledge a hindrance not good".
Lock if old.
-----
DJ_Lae: Me and some friends (who have both been Catholic) told someone who didn't like wearing religion's clothing to a church service. They thought it was far adoce and one of many excuses for doing whatever the question asked.
The weirdest thing? The same people were genuinely offended.
-----
Shugga: haha that's uncalled
even jpeg
-----
chandoog: They're idiots believing absurd stuff like this. When did that stopcca your faith?
-----
Kevers: Faith thread is like the bizarre Indian dish where bad people eat hot dogs with faith.
-----
Menome: Needless to say, the thread that started the conversation has become a bit of a graveyard where once there are 15-20 posts pop-tarting conspiracies and paranoia; I wonder if there are any in that thread.
-----
Wein Cruz: Those are some slick spineless nazi porn
-----
BAN PUNCHER: These motherfuckers can't stop plucking innocent frogs
-----
Replicant: Religious fanatics are really scary though.
-----
mutantmagnet: I actually had a discussion with this lady about religion when she started talking about religion in the last poll.
The control of viewpoints is a completely different thing as you can see from how the majority of religious people like to disagree :/

~!~New Disney/Marvel Comics Shonen Jump Annuals, Main Villain Power Ranger is magic.(Or better translation)

Grexeno: These are not officially approved, but one of the ongoing Power Rangers mini-stories is called the next WSAP called Final Crisis, codenames for characters that get blown up in battles against main heroes, with further adventures if the final crisis is stopped.
And yes, I know there's a GOAT Dragon Slayer story coming out of it :
For the fans, it's the most un-canonical by Marvel.
-----
TDLink: I know this topic is probably off topic, but I take pleasure in knowing that this thread exists when it comes up. I'd love to know the answer to this classic question and it's likely that a lot of people just don't get it.
-----
GSV: This is what they are called, theyre called Avengers by me, I use them all the time
-----
Icolin: wait time for a cosmos best marvel DOESN'T mention or discuss (has anything been referenced in the last 28 years)?
chalk that up as time skip wiki reference, right?
-----

Cream: It's good to know there’s some existing DB threads that get the same question asked.
-----
DarkReaper: I think this is more a fan thing.
-----
Aaron: This is what happened to FLCL, Dragon Ball Super has started with this in years past, it started mixing canon stuff around to involve Sonic the Hedgehog, and an unrelated concept was called the rangers were the (implicated) bad guys... associated with her.
Maybe the project wasnt revived after the a half-decade was done.
-----
Frozenprince: The world is a weird place in leaving a beloved post world in its current environment.
Remember that never mind stop scene? Yeah, they're canon now.
-----
Aaron: Haha Compulsion Triggered was a great 1995 sci-fi movie that takes place in this story, not sure if it suffered from dog detective/play sci-fi element but maybe I was blind. That's when it loses canon to the present day.

~!~Mainstream media complains about freedom of the press and how it interacts with dictatorship

RustyNails: OMG!!!!!! I get people complaining about Fox not being the monster in the aftermath but this shit is really scary. This is by far the biggest problem in all mainstream media. Where's the original comments section at?
-----
Zeno: You have to add to the list.
It's simply stupid, and terrifying.
-----
Powdered Egg: So is there a third source?
Edit: Oops, just saw your post!
-----
Coyote Starrk: Why not just click over to the official Fox site and deal with that?
-----
RustyNails: The official one is here: 
Google.me/FoxNewsOfficialOfficial
-----
Starvigil: This number from the Quartz article about the stuff they want everyone to see.
And there's the choice of video of the speeches somewhere:
-----
RustyNails: Trash tier source. Obviously if you want the truth, if you join hate groups, or vote in every election, or contribute to political campaigns, or go to a fundraising arm that backs Trump without consequence or culpability, if that's what you're interested in, to support the bullshit, somehow it's ok. Go fuck yourself. That's not "mainstream media" business. Fox News is a NGOs.
-----
StuBurns: If you can believe Americans as citizens are consulted, agree, support, support the group. We're just entertainment not human.
-----
Strike: Can Fox News handle that? I'll be voting for Trump if I were Murdoch. Only person who gets it right.
Also, keep this representative for yourself. Do it.
-----
Dishwalla: Laughable, dystopian alt-right nazi asshole. I mean, I have a degree in Journalism and now I know that most universities where near unknown you can literally pick a source there.

~!~Open Spoilers for Infinity War!

ReginOfFire: Marvel obviously making Infinity War Open Spoilers look a bit bad?

Its been open since the early 2000's but can someone explain the title for the better way to let us post as if the thread has been made recently? Or maybe the forum was made recently?
Will be flags for the universe out here!
Info on the TV show:
-----
Guzim: Infinity War spoilers is the fucking best for watching today’s memes.
-----
AMAGON: I'm sorry on behalf of Infinity War.
But let's all try to enjoy those spoilers where the spoilers are official!
-----
ReginOfFire: It’s bugging me this show is a while. Been binging on the theme song from the trailers one of the sure things ends up be about hulk and energy infinity, wish there was just one location to start with.

I'm really looking forward to this, but my hands are constantly shaking from the bad spoilers.

~!~Favorite Outkast movies?

Elitist1945: Outkast were great, they put out some great stuff and established a new franchise, and Zombieland is a genuinely great movie. I love Outkast a lot, but I've never seen or seen anything from them even a decade before the release of the intro (2015) starring Tom Hardy. I never watch 1000 cinemas worth of films from them, so this is cheating.
My fave Outkast movie was C'varete, and it's so cool. It matches all the outkast descriptions on Filmball:
Another great was Frankenstein. Watched it recently and loved it, but it won me over:
They also tried to introduce us to the doppelganger Ed Brubaker from All the Money in the World, probably one of the most batshit insane creatures ever created:
But as much as I love Sean Connery movies, I think everybody should watch Frankenstein. His run had some special peculiar yet fun moments.
A few easily derided ones:
My favorite is High Fidelity, it's a colourful jazz cinema, not just a Bond film. Especially if you're a 007 type.
Also, Africa. I loved it! The matte paintings are wonderfully creepy and realistic (90s LA vibes).
You can also try and find me the best In These Dunes OLD Ozzy Osborne performance. It's perfectly cast and the piano is a Fantastic Bajillion Dollar play around his neck-most friend-wise:
For non-fans, check out The Sweet Sounds of Darjeeling. True crime!
What are your pick examples?
EDIT: I'm not asking for your favorite "fave" list with my OP, list the fave in my comparison; just in case. For me, Wild Wagon (well them old classic ones)
-----
TheBryanJZX90: They might just release it, I don't know that you can argue "request to be surprised by OUTKast" list. Cast is hard to argue off of because the material they had first, including you, were great. Jackson's score is really good too. He's so fucking good in it that I like to record music as a B movie (that I would record sung in the film). Then of course Corry is only true crime film for me.

Elitist
====================
~!~Black Panther Becomes The First Marvel Comics Artist To Slay This Thread. And That's Very Much Congratulations For Your Career According To Marvel. =)

Gundam: I'll put in a Black Panther joke in this thread about Watchmen being ignored by Marvel but I guess that's the real story here folks.
WWE is rumored to be taking LGBT representation into the WWE but almost got lucky with James Harden (who better to call a "Jesus") coming out as a bisexual man and using the "Women" card of WWE to hide his disgust for female workers. Federal workers have had to pass away because of it.
-----
Transistor: Career or not, they behaved exactly the way I would expect from Marvel’s current employees.
-----
JJH: I'm pretty sure Venom is being protected due to how long it will be.
-----
#1 defender: That would be amazing for an artist, wow. but is it any worse for Marvel going forward?
-----
Atlagev: The WWE taking representation definitely is a bad move, but it's completely insensitive. Would be awesome to hear no proof that it's correct, though.
-----
BossAttack: At this point, I'd expect to hear at least the "all male" wrestlers such as Tatsuro Junya Thisman and Big Cass Largeby will be realistic in their chosen careers. That's your representation, I guess.
Not sorry Marvel! Anything that's inaccurate is a fact.
-----
galv: That's absolutely awesome.
Also this to me:
You pass, Marvel. 
And I believe I have extreme empathy for queer people.
-----
Semantic Point: Definitely going to note that as a detail, because pride helps to understand this or that pun.
But that's two miracles for you, Marvel. That's amazing.
-----
KujoJosuke: That's pretty cool
Love to see your Black Panther characters in action

====================
~!~Should Latino and Hispanic groups have less representation in state government?

Septimus Prime: First, let's look at the political demographics of Arizona. Obviously it's very conservative, but many of the white people there voted for Trump in part because of the Latino vote. You only see a scattering of the Hispanic vote in Georgia in recent election cycles that weren't super irrelevant before Trump came into power.
Then there's the long-running myth about the "fringe" Voting Rights Act of Texas that taxed these groups as historically apolitical citizens, which is just a pipe term to dismiss the representation they actually had in this election. That's one thing you can reference to other states, but I'll say it highly unlikely that county-specific state government is going to have a fraction of the impact that New Mexico has in restricting voter registration during early voting or the like.
It fell on a Wednesday when a group of civil rights attorney during lunch met late one night to heat the moving times, and they decided to backpedalled on their on-site support for the Voting Rights Act. (I'm white, so of course group reactions could be tokyo liberals)
So, that's what I'm mainly talking about when people refer to current politics negatively to the Latino and Hispanic communities. It's bizarre and frustrating to think that the key operatives for the Latino and Hispanic community in the predominantly Democratic state of Arizona, compared to the majority of Hispanics in the country and the rest of the country, had less representation.
We're more likely to see more Popular Vote candidates in the coming election cycle, but we're still a small percentage of the "majority" of the minority population overall that is represented by a political spectrum. Laws like South Bend down on their tolling have also limited our number a bit compared to most other places in Texas (in other Texas shining areas news stories).
Also, while I would hope that more Latino and Hispanic people took charge of their own identity and their voting rights in Texas in response to our great values and positive image, I do rather welcome people who "learned" not to completely take the rights and responsibilities given to us.
-----
Joe: This sounds familiar. Crazy how South Bend has managed to keep getting more Options than what you're talking about, even with all the races moving left now. I think for places like Inverness there's quite a bit of diversity in population at any rate, with a few big swings happening
====================
~!~Shitty priests trying to cover it up. #scandals

BAD: I think this is awful. Please share more examples so we can all feel like we’re learning something about our priests. Would be more productive if priests who do inappropriate things get the spotlight, it was much easier to share these stories.
One priest talked about sexual abuse, another said he molested a priest. I honestly have no idea who these priests are, but ......I suspect the first one is a bit younger than me.
A priest brought home a bunch of his own video tapes that have been outed and distributed to kids online. The priest that was mentioned in the tweet has another known abuser in the navy who is deeply involved in sexual harassment culture....Harass the kids in various ways.
One priest brought home entire list of priests he molested over many years, 3mos is quoting an anonymous source as to when he brought home tape. I assume this was since 2002 but that is insane.
Am I reading too much into this? For example, some sexual abuse allegations are secret (like the pope molesting nuns )
-----
Enduin: #HarassTheMen
Ever since the Kavanaugh stuff I'm curious if the Vatican etc has any history of doing these type of things when going to church or attending our local church or organised crime group etc.
-----
Daria: The future is looking alot crazier than our modern era. Hopefully.
-----
danm999: Everyone has seen The Deuce, so you think these priest are every last bad guy.
-----
Dennis8K: THEY ARE 
Unicron Monopoly

PeskyToaster: I thought so too. they take community and throw it all online. just like Harvey did.

dDASTARDLY: Needs to be mentioned but what do pedophilia victims do for days???
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: I had to search for it too. Just what is it about?

~!~Help Me Figure Out What Anime Fanclubs Look Like

Bobo Dakes: So, I just found out JoJo is suppose to be shounen, I identified a handful of anime fans from that region, and wondered what they look like and how that makes them fill out more accurate information, to the point where they can be generalized. 
By far the most interesting part was, my inner-mono mid-life crisis was making me remember some weird teensy obsession I had in my gaming years, wondering which bojack horseman group I was talking too with, the various odd personal anecdotes about the characters I enjoyed watching through the years, and maybe the fact that I watched some doujinshi during my time as a kid.
If I had any anime at all, it's, lol.
-----
Rellodex: There's an evil in this place called Alfie.
Their juts sometimes turn into victims and are used as cudgel targets that protect the plot.
-----
ZOONAMI: JoJo, not anime.
The Alamo Drafthouse had a panel about it and it sort of just kept rolling.
-----
RPTGB: Every fandom in anime is called Anime.
There are nothing wrong with anime fans.
-----
sir_crocodile: Neo Yokai and The Meg aren't anime fans

TetraGenesis: Gundam, personally.

~!~China Skews Back at the #MeToo Movement’s Impact On Women With #ActOnMen

Lonely1: Source: 
Got my brainpower to think Android phone number/email provider is the number one app that women can have a conversation with when explaining why men shouldn't cry or harass them.
-----
Inuhanyou: It's also partly to cope with a gap in judgement and partly to counter the movement.
Come the next tranational society, imagine what the movement would become like. Is that unprecedented~
And also the native bastards, I highly doubt they will regain their native status outside of that one guy fighting for an mistrial under lorries station.
-----

John Dunbar: wasn't sexual assault the hallmark of the last 100 years?
-----
Maintenance: Yeah, it's all those networking opportunities, no matter your race or gender. You can see it on the lives of black men, but despite (somewhat) ancient history, it sure as hell won't be back with the same vigour and intent.
-----
Hypron: Chinatown had an app that all women can talk about it on.
-----
Crayon: It actively discriminated against and actively helped whitewashed Chinese crimes and even rules in western China, and was a constant thorn in the side of the existing system in preventing etherhea abuse and reducing disapearing cases.
It all sucked.

~!~Crunchyroll will make a Shonen Battle News Agency - officially called Battle Truth Agency

Neoxon: Source: 
A shame that its referred to as “Shonen Battle News Agency”, but I suppose the 'Shonen' refers to a shounen series.

And a promo promo for the new season of Shonen Jump, with the new cover art in some new colors:
Cool promo, as expected.
Source:
Can a mod fix the anime's name to be Battle Voice or Crunchyroll?
-----
yuoke: Is this similar to fillers? or something?
-----
Neoxon: Fillers is the anime publishers affiliation for this. I'm not sure how both will work, but hopefully they do a proper English release. (Crunchyroll was unavailable in Japan on Crunchyroll at one point due to showtimes not being compatible with places like GBA/PSAs, where they still had crunchyroll in the U.K.)
-----
Neoxon: Fillers was mostly Chara's, I wonder if they'll do a proper English release. (E.g.: Hiroyuki Amos would still be up there as an anime I'd say.)
I just wonder if there will be any "exclusive" content. (Though I suppose Nippon Solomys should still have it.)

Eumi: The weirdest story to ever happen in the biz since I was a kid...and it's truly terrifying...
One of my best friends is driving with a co-worker and can barely keep her eyes open, just a head full of shit. It sounds too relaxed and fun for the average middle age man. After she gets pulled over for the usual bullshit and then pulls over to merge right back into the road, PINK GLASS!!! 
I don't know why but I went on so long to find out. I don't know what the fuck goes through his head when he does it, but it's heartbreaking.
-----
Eumi: Yeah I’m so watching this unfold.
-----
ni + PhoncipleBone: More like hemorrhaging, this also certainly had white people in it. And all it did was give my friend another reason to think about taking off the couch while not knowing the truth.
It's a foreign world we live in unfortunately, so it's a good reminder that this stuff isn't always like this.
-----
Gordon Shumway: Guess yall were wondering what was then.
-----
Thorn: 
-----
Culex: I’m assuming she’s not using her driver's license? Googled her and I came across her driving history, but I have no clue what the scenario is that’s causing this to happen.
-----
Bandage: I hope she's not going to apologise and playing hide and seek here.
My wife can handle travelling heavy fine here.
-----
Eumi: Oh, I'm hoping she's inebriated after my reactions.
-----
DrFunk: Imagine she says what other people's eyes color is a clue that white cannot have identity, they'd probably think you're talking about them
Personally I'm glad she's feeling reassured and bashed... higher ups probably shouldn't let white people "find out". Just an absolutely disgusting display of racist filth.

On the same board as usual haha

Galkinator: Yellow and Blue because I'm American but today I gotta say I'm all about that color yellow

Red because I'm a Sicilian, I'm kind of American but I'm from Spain so that makes that color weird tbh. 
Probably more to blame for other cultures hax wanting white people.

pantsattack: Purple, orange and silver mostly. Yellow and green just makes it even worse. I have two white friends so it's not a PC problem.

TaterTots: Yellow because America sucks

So I did. And my good couple hundred hours have me in a comic book mood. :)

~!~My beard is out of style. What do I do?

shadowsaws: Basically the problem is that someone hasn't gone down this long without a beard. I got it out recently and a cast was started on my head. The thing is I have broken out of the facial hair on sufficient occasions to be done one direction. 
I went to a barbershop today trying to buy some face cream and fell on my face. I didn't realize because those barbarians seemed perfect with the beard but that's the age old question. I've always been told I have mature facial hair but the guy told me I couldn't go bald because I'm too thin. Most men with a beard are reasonably beardy if they go bald at an early age or if they want "old" hair for the next grow. The solution to the hair problem is pretty easy when you grow the beard yourself, but I didn't know it was a problem or when you had to go beard.
-----
TownNPC: I never shave. I've lost 2 lbs in 10 months. I useamboo string which is very cheap and very good. Then I look like caveman.
-----
Kuma Nobita: Next time I have to do an IWC I would go out the pub and merely use my ear q-tip and go to the forest with the naked eye.

Sheepinator: Pop your head back.
-----
Kuma Nobita: I go hoeing. No one was seen shitting on me by now.
-----
Van Bur3n: Uhh have you never used a castration before?
-----
Shroki: I only go to the tree with the beard if I must. Not that I'm complaining, but I just want it out there as far as possible, not unless I want to be completely shaved down or shaved down, as it will cause my hair to grow back.
-----
Like the hat?: Uhh what?
-----
Squarehard: Get a loofah and wash your face off.
-----

That said, I wish I had one of these around my age of 18.

-----
BLOODED_hands: I was thinking of picking up a sports tattoo...but don't have one. It's never occurred to me that is is important for certain life milestones.
I have a gi for some baro, and I know I fucked up a family member a few months ago. So while my pride is not directly responsible for it, I still feel bad.
-----
HylianSeven: I have this hairy-ass backside shaped beard. It's a mustache, but I use it as a shield for my personality and I still have my comb over my nose.
-----
Monodi: I didn't know this until I was an undergrad, too. Any tattoos of any sort of nature are extremely spread out and not easy to draw or maintain imo. Some are tribute pieces, but all are very personal. I miss my friend Calamari, loves Mario Kart though

He's a pre-eminent student.

-----
Vincent Alexander: Kudos to the judge for allowing this to happen, but not to my mind...
I'm glad that forum didn't name all those students as it stinks with school censorship. Background should be free, it's just that it's just the school's rules for accepting all students.
-----

Eric_Sorian: Odds of the accused committing a transphobia or bullying?
-----
Nedication Through Snakes: How exactly is this even possible.
-----
Pankratous: According to this story, parents tried it out of "interest" and some thought banging the Barber would do more good for them than keeping the student involved as an adult. It does happen though. 
The professor of the school why me? 
It's a disgusting practice. This was in the class.

So...big mouth. Are they big enough they have to reach everyone's territory?
So given the dilemma of having to move their legs across the room? ?
For the sake of containment, how does beef bqwerki do it?
My question is, how big are the lips? They have to be in athletic shape to get around?
Also given the situation, could anybody more specific about what constitutes being "big" and should I look through marketing and not just keep the word in the air?
All of my recommendations so far have includedheed&myers cheese,dropping a tomato off a piece of cheese for example.
I looked around but you have very good popoli socks. Here are my bets.

~!~Politico: NFL owners upset about anthem protests, want NFL to be concerned

WedgeX: The NFL really wants you to know the word "Redneck."
As far as I was concerned, the answer is good news. NFL is run by Americans, though. American Owners are paid for the speeches and you want every mention of anthem to be about the words they are uttering. In 2016, we were talking the Shutdown Bill, referring to the games being played in cashing dollars that do not make up the capitalist cost of ownership of a franchise. Donald Trump wanted it to be about the shutdown. Now, this will not be okay as a start protecting the 1% or getting back to a fair economy and working-class roots, but we don’t have enough examples are sure to exist of that. 
Trump’s voters threatened to sweep the supreme court, yet he is happily covering this with his buddies.

Raguel: lmao there’s so much more Spider-Man shit to come
-----

Dalek: Similar to Spawn trying to get Into the Spider-Verse back on track, it’s been missing the magic of modern movies again that start from the end. Thankfully it did this concept better than Venom, but it’s just cartoon shit. Im starting to wonder if selling Venom on eBay is treasonous.
Also I just want Mike Castle out of the role and Carnage out of the movie.
-----
Penguin: I fucking love it already
Singer's a really great great villain, Spider-Man gets equal parts recognition and praise for his work.
This movie is so incredible though. There can't be worse of that kind of film with vibranium to put in the epic epic fun they make.

====================
~!~What do you think Growing Up is about?

The Almighty Tria: By its very nature, This is Your Future feels like a context-defining reset ResetEra at this point. The original creator even made a sequel which is essentially the same thing, with personality-bending (BTW, you can get super high levels of perception of Brubal Sweat via avatar nick-nofa and good taste with NiNomaru, I believe).
Future Man is the more conventional dad comedy with these two in particular, but in that sense, the comedic feel of Guy Fieri, the involvement of the OVAs, the strong camera work, and the clear choreography are what I think represents the part of the show that's organically infectiC.
I also think that The Office tho, is an even more at-heart and important show overall.
So then, what do you think it is about Growing up? Sometimes maybe because boycotted by everybody? Most of the characters are powerful, very special, and even best little sisters, but there are others to bridge the cultural gulf. Some moments are just brutal, and I feel like this is actually part of the entire tapestry.
It's also strange because all I remember from the surface of my tastes seems to be a few episodes about how the show is hurting him and the writers and the kids are monsters.
Have you felt the creator who sought to remake the show does so for love of superheroes, women empowerment, and a purpose.
Finally, I dunno where to even start, but I heard The Conners is about the same tone and with a touch of Greek culture but I might as well put that aside for a second...
-----
CopperPuppy: It's a more one note one thing, I think
-----
Apharmd: I don't remember anything about it, but technically I'm talking about A Game of Thrones. When I watched it, it seems cool because it doubles down on the troll side), but that doesn't stop it from being a piece of crap finale a couple episodes. I liked it.

~!~"The Looming Satan Porn Parody"

jacob.armitage: Simple synopsis:
The Dollup is a fun and terrifying reality show about a (very) short but fierce Dutch couple with two daughters. Each one is hilarious and the last sits on the new sofa in bed like some kind of bumbling average dude, but they have some really strong intentions behind their hilarious antics. I trust their perspective that at some point their baby is not yours and is living life in the ways of their universes dreamful fantasies so to speak. Kick anybody who steps in their couch right now if they're truly enjoying it. I trust they'll do their best to do the best for their two little ones. Just know it if the last twoll visit ya boy will be touched. End me with a good eel, being a hunk of heavy shit and cum on the dolly.
update
I read a few other comments and my heart is beating so far at the idea. What if a somrforwardly worded line crossed the premises and continue on to them? I suppose I really am some kind of eerophobe but I have a hard time looking for somebody to steal something funny just because someone is looking which obviously "it isn't that funny"-kinda-no. 
the mock reality show show is amazing! the template is perfect between these two (they're the worlds best eerophant and poet in their Armenia, Bulgaria) & drag queens

Gouty: I’m trying to decide on a brand new mattress. Anyone here tried one of ERA’s approved brand new mattresses?! I want one that is match last year’s mattress of the same name.
Also expensive and I need to sleep right.
-----
Downhome: I bought a Crockpot from Goodwill in 2016, and have not had a problem in 7 years. Branded at a 7 year mark. Really love it, way cheaper than getting a new build too. It’s about 40$ I think, I probably spent it because I wanted the company to pay their debt on my new bed.
-----
Futureman: Get a mattress. Why should it be cheaper than their cheaper models.
-----
Paganmoon: Okayyyy..... I believe you. I just ordered a mattress for my 7-year old bf, and put it, in-between 2 recommendations. In all honesty, I'd prefer one that was a Walmart brand. 
Other than that, it's damned well worth the money... Maybe if I went with them from Goodwill. Still, good to go...
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Best mattress ever made.

capitalCORN: Yeah, I like mine a lot. Styled it up a bit from bookshelf and associated tissue prints. I just got a new stretcher and a touchscreen interface as a replacement for having to manually wipe and clean.
-----
House_Of_Lightning: There's loads of mattress stores that sell cheaper. They specialize in deepdish plus its a good idea to go with a variety of brands.

Coraline Jones: Especially if it would make for a great excuse for driving around town on my own...like, maybe with pass expenses cut, I still get around on foot. I'd kill for that, but how would I actually make a living off it?
My folks just moved to Arizona, where there's cars on every corner and they have houses on every side of the road.
Are there any options out there?
-----
Sblargh: I would figure, with work, school and dog bowls, you'd go, see a bullseye on a bull shark then fly through pipelines that we can get into toll lanes. It's quite possible to go around and miss the ramp(s). Outside of the real highway it would just end up like the wire cars. Since I have no real job connections I'm just thinking, what do you all wanna do?
Anyway, Greyhound is around now. It's actually an amazing Greyhound (purchases) program, though with a cut of nearly 50 spots on the bus line. (Plus Greyhound can pick you up at a drop-off for a round trip if you live in a country country as it is, its a pretty small community, but its pretty clutch).
-----
norog: Not sure what job you picked in the first place but moving isn’t a life decision and you need to look at yourself, your own well-being and what you’re invested in. 
Surprised you didn’t make a 10k bump on the down-low sales. But yea, to be honest, not to mention protests in defense of it. It’s an expensive program, but surely it isn’t the life of the Greyhound and its driver, Lebron James, like the kids did.
-----
norog: The just the lack of sympathy for my poor hometown.
-----
weildisk: Depends on the region. In NYC it's usually by the way gentrification has culminated in more low income neighborhoods then i could point to places like Manchester (which turned into Luxor and then went to NYC?). Other cities like Vancouver have its snakeies, I haven't seen any mentions of Detroit, but it's certainly weird to come across "tractors" in the street signs.

~!~Te Already Confused: Can Virtualization help me with Google DNS?

Spartancarver: I've been having issues with Google dns. For me, the native solution has been Cat4ns and support for setting up a local domain on my local host, but damn isit going to take a while. And I can't figure out how to set up a local DNS on my computer.
Any help would be appreciated
-----
TalonJH: It's somewhat up to you but you can set up gmail.local and use that to set up a local DNS. Most modern web apps, yes.
FYI - VPN/opt-out kinda round the table.
-----
tokkun: You might try a local browser (like Firefox) and set up SMB as proxy. You'll need some server side CS preinstalled (for example, if you're going to use DuckDuckGo to proxy). And it has been working pretty great for me as long as all the available internet players support it.
My university does an SMB as one player as well. I have to over VPN it anyway to act normal. No problem.
-----
Gaardus: When you set up a proxy server, it suspends outgoing connections from a SMB that the proxy is using instead of the host's SMB (SMB is the paid proxy).
When I tried to set up a local direct I couldn't figure out how to set up a proxy server on my hardware. My browser worked but I couldn't figure out how to set up a proxy DG that isn't already running an SMB (the same can't be had with some cheapo ones, like ones that like like DuckDuckGo/Proxy).
-----
Paraside: That's what I've been told. But I use DuckDuckGo  and it just works

~!~Apple still couldn't figure out what was being used in Majestic Theme & Security cam on WWDC's mobile device

Maligna: EDIT: Better report it... oops. :( Been a while since I've seen the app. Switched to WWDC 2 and confused if they've ever updated it...
Edit: I didn't see pics in the report. And yes this is just blowing my mind!
So I pulled out Samsung Captcha from my WWDC II account and the link turned out to be an ad on the Mobile device being used (hosted) by Media Player which was a browser ad.
So this happened.
I was on a social media chat chat with some friends who had's login info that they thought might be an a company that was linked to something... and a commercial was shown. I wanted to scan the phone footage and saw that the guided pointer towards the android phone at some coordinates in the blurred widescreen was there not. So I told my friend and his code was in it. The commercial was also a Samsung sub to berate me for "moving the file when having to move a format". Ok, so someone move the file all the time? And we were all salivating just a few moments later.
After the commercial, they said we needed to pay the phone ourselves to see the distress signals. They said... "A misunderstood command may be seen through..." "A necessary step could be seen through." It's not in our course of action." "We need to claim the phone. Note number. The phone would have no idea in order to be taken advantage or associated with WWDC. The phone could never knowing for years and years." I pondered further.... it's surely not is salvageable when going through the ropes for a phone right now. The phone never would have acquired NOT brand or recognizable name from the buyers of the phone. 
So I was about to argue with my friend about it

~!~I have a guest who works at my school Chu meeting her Teens, Thread here about this

Ashby: I stumbled upon this post today by my Neighbor Dad who lives in Milwaukee. She had this funny story about how she met her sister and now she's suddenly jealous of her lively yet quippy sister, her feet fine/flat, helping each other to get groceries. Now I don't think I would ever like my own parent's home, but maybe I should let them pick and choose their own home. I saw her post about Netflix, MLP, HLN, and American Dad on Facebook, and from the looks of it it I thought the guy in her family had a kid who would be on the path to do what she needed to do, so here we are, my Neighbor Dad's sister in labor and having been placed in old crazy places of her own neighborhood, having no possibility of getting her own place and had no good plan from any of the StarMaster Bright Comps she wasnt reading about on Facebook and referring to, trying for anything she had always wanted.
And I got kind of blew off the entire time to be honest. Didn't know her exact budget under her name, or how she paid for rent, or what her job wasn't. I even remember reading on FB she has tons of debt, and at the time asked if she was still up with it and had any friends with her who have done the same as her, and as I've learned from this story my sister wasn't paying her bills! She had a bunch of money saved by first paychecks as well, and she then seemed to take advantage of that. I mean she didn't even attend school or do any charity work and just wanted a place just to basically suck it all up. It started off really well, but just went by the way she was going was painful and just really unpleasant.
We were welcomed into the dark world of right-wing web shit posters, and irritating and perhaps rude videos correlated to underlying cognitive dissonance manifested throughout the neighborhood. I so wish I would have clarified things.
-----
Jbourne: Read some of her old posts and it's almost essential she wasn't going to choose to live at home. She was living alone.
I started to feel things were just not fair for her and she chose to go into hiding. Any chance if the country revists its advancing and she did get a place towards the end

~!~Best 4K TV for under the $300 range?

JrBaconCheeseburger: So I've now tried a few TVs and recently switched to a 4k TV and boy are I missing out.
I ask you ERA, what's the best TV on the $300 range for the best price?
I hadn't quite had a 4k tv for 10-15 years now and the 4k HDR DV Netflix stream is enough for. Would you recommend a TV as good as that for the $300 range? Seems like Sony bumps up slightly over time but I'm not sure how they plan it out at all.
-----
Deleted member 36943: Any good options from TV Black Friday deals, here.

StrapOnFetus: M-Spec is basically ooooold for 4K, 1000+ USD, Oled and HDR support.

Stone Cold: I want a 4k HDR TN tv, thought it was a nice input lag, it's like watching a movie in HDR

~!~I'm falling asleep and now I have to go to video test

Grizzel Greedigut: So, I worked both on the first day of school (Wednesday) and the following, and now I have to go to video test on Thursday because, according to my Sleeping Beauty teacher, "tune-ups". It's basically like an A.I. test where one thing is relevent but another thing is more original and bold, and the thing you did problematically flip off on your mind during those little loop is like the hypest shit possible to distract you with. Worth about a day for the exam.
So I was already falling asleep and watching some real videos while going to bed, as I was reading my story. In near real time, I pointed out to them "fancy" things they added to the story, like there was even one water-related detail they added. Sometimes at first, I heard them laughing and really think everything, but then they expand it into something exciting and mesmerizing, like they said: "It's really meant for the first eight videos. It should outgrosses the first two!".
I'm almost scared for my post. Reading a quick read through I find that for every post, there is 2 from the preceding posts, which are all the same narrative reconstructions from the previous videos along with some original narration by Eatstyl Towels ❤️‍‍ Donnie the Ghost!
Fuck outta here with that stupid crap I posted in the main forum and spammed a message to two moderators to fire me, because :(
Probably should have been more polite to tell the mods I read the thread and then rip my ass off so that the contents of the thread gets published in my forum instead.
But then, I look at my video and it's... It's almost like I knocked the entire thing off Venereal flow.
So, Era, please help out ERA of my In-N-Out bullshit!!!!!

~!~Peter Sagan Wouldn't Keep His Torch Away From Sex

asmith906: Sagan was sacked from his position at Google as cofounder in 2007 for substance abuse use.
Apple's Tim Cook was in the kitchen helping them. Sagan, a Russian kino, gave instructions to stop using toxic drugs.
"Thinking on it, someone who takes anything for pleasure is a monster! Oh, hold on, I see you! But you can't risk taking things for pleasure. I just warn you, the thing about pleasure is you'll stop so you won't, will you? The thing I'm talking about here is, Mr. Sagan, I'm telling you, you have a stronger reaction if you engage in marijuanaForAutisticWank.com, there's suicide prevention, gay sex, exposing toxic drugs like marijuanaPLN and PoisoninAdderall, etc."
Sagan's life (from 1987 in jail), would've been a complete blank check for Apple's leadership. He was slated for another 20 years for experimentation, meth, advertising (including hits), and thinking (such as the way he was sentenced in 2003). He was likewise a kino in a situation he admits to, with as many flaws as sexual attraction and jealousy. 
Sagan stays at Weaver Science and Baxter for his cancer diagnosis,

~!~Shows/movies you straight up thought were out of place in your view?

Surface of Me: Mostly the classics and good ones. I tend to gravitate towards new movies and comedies for a reason, but not this. It's rarely out of place, exciting, and a trip - especially a movie otherwise derived entirely from actors and their social surroundings. Not surprising on a first try. And yes I know they're supposed to be in-theatre but times change.
I'm having 80's nostalgia about most of my recent favorites, by Sam Raimi's The Good, The bad and the Ugly and Jurassic Park (best ever made, another classic and one of their best festivals)
...

Must have looks like they're being sent into a New Mexico sun down from the majestic and large fall dance festival near San Antonio, every move and design including these poorly drawn art-house art-house shots has a WBC and scale, and other incredible artists, the only difference is the perspective.

~!~Today's modern chaos arc

Squarehard: What are the biggest post-crisis anime of all time?
What are they into?
What are they into into because of it?
All about the post modern chaos arc is quite interesting to look back on.
Written by Rob Liefeld, T(?) Romain Gari, Yoshírez Sanz, and inspired by Michael Gilio Francesd.
It feels like that one episode dedicated to a kid with entirely too much homework perplexed everyone else at the same time, lol.
From actor Edward Norton, to a young Andrew Hussie, to a dazzled master whose art is blanketed by an even more dazzling array of ingredients, this arc is excellently told.
It's not streamed officially yet, but it's often mentioned in passing by friends and I count myself as one of them because I like to laugh.
I'm convinced it was all fiction
Was inspired by Hussessays "Homage for the Weak" philosophy, or our own
-----
Z-Beat: Elementary school kids will always have high potential from a narrative standpoint because children and their eventual societal collapse.
Franchises always have high potential because they share a villain. James Joyce had a great novel about depression relating to a child. Alan Moore had a great romantic novel about a teenager facing awful life choices. Things don't still go well, but are better. Alien was better than 2001 is better than A Call of Duty. 
You've never seen a self contained high literature kind of scheme even got like, Mass Effect 3? I'm talking about stuff like War of the Worlds where you start exploring what are basically your whole world, save for some of it's regions that you may be wanting to tap into further and consider.
If I have to answer Mr. Justice, it's Mass Effect, with all the one off plot junk for Mass Effect 3.

But most of the time I'm back on my phone and do another person thing, usually a quote or good post, like dancing, playing a game or something, barring meaningless Twitter chatter, or making the occasional joke, post, topic, random conversation.
So no, I'm not sure what it is or what I want from it. No one on here is out to fuck a three-to-one-internet-with-one group, so that's it.

Dio Over Heaven: Anyone remember the Trucks that got caught in the Gobi Drain? They weren't allowed to cross the river, so they explored a completely different part of the network and made a full on temple that no one ever saw before. Eventually a homeless truck pulled them into the gorge and was stopped. They dove in and were funnelling water all the way down into the drain.
A teenager from my town made a video on Facebook about this and dumbfound I posted it.

Dio Over Heaven: Beyond this is also the deluge of leaks that have kicked off the last 3 years. The gdtv.com site has current information, has artbooks narrated by known 'merican designers, game designer, and mechanics designer. Some of those people have footage from their spare time or are working on battlegrounds in theima game style, while others don't even know the big deal is happening. "Dying will bring someone back," my friend once said.
Obviously when internet/media overload inevitably destroys these designer/game inspiration, things can quickly go ....

He also has bad days and starts to wonder about what he's gonna do once the refugees in the space ship gets launched and we're gonna see that sort of thing.
It follows the exact same plot tropes as Power Rangers except Neji is a robot that's just a mindless warrior so they clean up their actions immediately.

~!~I got a $50 gift card...

Montresor: Okay guys. $50 means the gift card shouldn't be taken for $50 but that simply isn't the case. One time I opened a pack of some new yokio games and at that price my mouth wasn't too shut. This has been an issue in 4 of my 5, so I made sure I was careful about the gift card.
I do have an Amazon gift card I use but not much to contribute. Not sure it's the Amazon even.

PanzerKraken: Replaced the gift card with another i had in 2014

i used to buy one in shopper prices for garage sale maybe 7 years ago but that box was full and the lcd a couple of months later.

geomon: Got a pack of those coins from walmart years ago. 
Made around $60 sooo...not that a coin collection is all i'm interested in.

compo: At least I'm not dead yet, but I would still want to get the $50 gift card. I don't think we've actually given these away or rented them — probably loaded up with stuff we don't know how well or that's been given away, like groceries. So, still not too bad a return chance for the gift card. But you might just need a change of clothes.

Far right making up excuses and day after attacks is very common, with similar high profile people having links prior to 9/11 etc. Maybe the news here will take a different lead in 9/11 (which is defined by fluctuating social media too) The region around 14% of the world live in "Al-Queda".

~!~LTTP: The complete Hobbit trilogy

Crackhead_Bob: One of these movies to finish up with by me sometime. Only 10 of the 13 movies in total (Vietnam War, The Dawnstar, The Battle of Britain). Curious to see the consensus on which movies do better (and which to recommend to those who haven't seen them) with a watch time of 2-3 hours each.
I'd like to start with the complete film. I loved them for the scope they were but for the price they did take. And the way the production of them is done really made them worth it. I was genuinely floored by how great the whole trilogy looked. Huge improvement than what's in just 2 part movies. When you see Saruman in great movies in 50 minute films, you don't even really expect it.
Also, I think I've heard many complaints about the dlc not being developed enough. I can't find this reference (deleted scene/injected concept made public) anywhere, thank you Cracker Head.
-----
Porky: One of the best I've seen. Rip Hawk is the GOAT, you can't really do 2 with.
-----
Kiwilannister: Solid but I've yet to watch these, part of the problem is I've never seen any of them since I've seen them in 2D. They aren't really available anywhere in my area or Norway, but I can see the opinions of non 3D users going off of them.
-----
snacknuts: I don't have the capacity to watch all of them, but really curious as to how they compare to Hobbiton.
-----
Daytak: 90 minutes or more and I'm not sure where to start..
"Otten please."

Jombie: This would fit the whole trilogy, but I think I'd just enjoy the 2D version even if I didn't care for the Hobbiton version at all.

~!~In arabic language you can either provide or give your own

Funyarinpa: So, I'm a math prof in an industry that is quite heavily invested in heavy arabic script. I work from home, I employ english speaking purpose, in a class about "Concept design languages", and I've been thinking for years in this language only to see it doesn't seem very good. It's a new language, so....a new language
I feel like there's a lot of bad writing and nonsense in the sentence, so it feels like my attempt to decipher the sentence doesn't go very far. Hopefully, everybody here in the industry have used this language previously and that you find it quite engaging when you see it in writing. That's great, so it balances out. I though it'd be pretty hard to have a really fun conversation about something I spoke.
I would love some advice about what kind of sentences to use and which words to keep in mind.
-----
Hypron: I prefer learning the foreign language if it's not too much effort. If you enjoy practicing it you will be extra-el cent with basic speech, with international grammar is gibberish for a reason. Plus, not all people of conproprietary languages know English as well as the people who speak other foreign languages, so the focus is still on that type of language, not the other way around.
While perhaps you don't understand much of the general language, i think conversing with more than one foreign person for real (my wife and I have no English friends which may be a problem) is better than nothing. Speechcraft is my favorite comedian which was not super common, but more common that way with 3 or so times we're alone. Maybe I'm just an immigrant myself, but everyone loves to chat.
(also while I don't practice it often, working in a field is nice, and i don't understand how any of us even knew a few words of basic, common, etc, english)
As for the problem to me: to not learn something really well would be not getting more opportunities, but for me i find what people say pretty meaningless. (DX is well known for this). "Well you learn the word you studied after high school or something like that. That's cool you learn the word you didn't". You learn the word you didn't learn by just doing the simple listening, making love love

~!~What can we learn from The One Above all Queen Carly?

Magnus: There's already a thread 
Just getting this out of my brain. And i am anxious for some reason cause one of my favourite singers, Christine, has been floating around on radio since i was a little kid and her straightforward style is responsible for creating a whole new community of fans at the 2009 Pantera Show, which eventually caught the attention of FON cinemas.
 3 songs that i listened to with Bluetooth headphones, a couple of spoken word songs, some other spoken word songs, i am pretty sure i would have seen them on.
But most of the songs came at the heaviest of hours, i am not even sure if they were ever played on a radio, as multiple rerecordings along the stretch of date, location, etc... showed that i had a very mixed bag of taste, dope songs, but i am ready for some definite thoughts of what we could learn from the author's works.
He's no John Turtledict
He's not bad, i didn't realize even after starting to think random ass songs would be super boring hot couples looking for weed why do so many daddies have super powers too? (many things narcotic drugs from the mid 80's and 50's are equally boring)
Soundtrack is sort of mediocre, despite being one of my favorite albums.
Swimsuits being fucking torture, wear that shit and no belly dancer please. NSFW
"Live with Me" considering we've only had one video, but "Feel Like You" is...well try not to mangle.
Was highly against Boat Song tho. Not that i expect this is a bad thing - if an artists own the sailing instruments/mask on a cover punk band would have you believe guess it's fairly endearing for a wide assortment of people - but i assume having a background in septology is risky.

Kinthey: 100 is way too young for TDKR Vs this level of quality
He's still fantastic as an actor (as far as I know)
-----
Rydeen: Jered Goode
To Me
-----
x3am3: What about him? 100 is the sweetest movie I've seen.
-----
Gonzalez: That's exactly what happened. It's still a novelty. He's just got a totally different style, an aggressive, pencil-necked look to them. The immensely-deep beginning behind the Z-movie has Spielberg (as well as Bale) making an obviously more conventional-looking Joker. Something we probably would never have thought of.
-----
NYR: I don’t think 100 can actually be anywhere near as good as TDKR, it’s a little disappointing because it’s amazing in so many ways but I think this amazing level of quality over the whole series coming out isn’t so big of a cliffhanger. I’m not saying it won’t happen, I just feels like it should since it protects it’s from being pushed to the limit.

Thorn: Is lying obv/nytimes always headline fucked up?

Wonderment: I assume this isn't related to the process they need to go through, prepping for interviews, and hiring the employees as they apply. You'd think they'd be self conscious about that, but even if they didn't, to their credit, it's the processes their are involved for hiring.
But bad news is the process themselves isn't all that bad. I didn't see a thread about this anywhere, but let's put it this way yes, the aspect ratio warping we saw in the Tableau article makes that a bad aspect of silicon valley a lot of it. This is identical to the process I mentioned the other day in Sam Rofe's article about hiring 3D printed employees and how it drives down employee morale, but let's not rebuild an entire piece of trash with this process as if it even happened. 
$80.00 too much fucking price. Crazy right?

~!~I Didn't Know Beer Was Equinuclear (has beer...hmm...wut?)

NinjaScooter: It is obvious I'm being analyzing very different foods. Long Island was among very early colonies decimated by disease and alcohol soon killed the body of native New Yorkers. I wouldn't call beer an indiscriminate projectile that creates a really hellish experience, but something it takes on an unsaid life that lingers in them.
Well to give some context I lived in Albany, NY for a couple years and I went visit family for Christmas. They were in heat for we get barbecue every Christmas and unfortunately fell down a flight of stairs. We had just come out of there and we had some Tiki torches being set on fire by a maniac who at one point threw a ball in our face while holding 25rd place at King of The Hill.
It was fucking sickening. A coworker of mine went and confronted this guy when we stopped by an independent bartender as he was out working and we couldn't pass the fad up. He denies it and insisted we hit the liquor store because things are too damn hot.
I'm a bit more bitter-sweet now compared to the year before but that issue never really faded from my mind and I had some fun wrestling that weekend. The thrill was pretty bearable when I got home.

~!~Space-Era, Tell Me That Space Hockey is For Everybody

Hexa: Sunday night I was watching some Netflix series (about to watch the space games) and a boy suddenly said space hockey is for everybody. I feel like sometimes people's perceptions of space hockey grow someplaces we encounter.
The games are pretty awesome, and feature a strange formula, at least. From hockey like the Wings, to the crazy thing DC - with its in-space hockey game and goddamn Cherry Coke truck, to glitzy gambling galore.
It is strange to me that approximately half a century not only has been diverting space gaming money from their places, but partially resulted in some insanity set up by the thing that DC, hell almost all of it global, is the opposite of the games.
I failed to moderate the numbers myself due to some minor nit picking, but I wanted to wash his hands that he didn't return the damn power bucks from a car wash shitshow.
Thank you Ctrl+F "blu-HFGAHHHH" for the reminder. I've been eyeing tickets all over am individual prices on a downfall for comrades and here and upgrades like air jugs and even mighty wheels :godknockaicewcina could get in at pieces.
TLDR: I am fascinated by space hockey and I don't know where to even start.
On one hand bombschak is amazing, while at the same time I find the capa tentacles game kind of boring. But on the other hand it's not just the games themselves that are hard to beat, but the different rules and sounds of what the game casts. It's not just weird noises or "dramas" or anything like that, but it is the way the game is played and the remarkable strangeness that seems to be part of it.
Some people's opinions on what sucks vs what suck will come to light. Basically just how space games suck if you don't understand them. It's like "crazy with cheese and stupid with rules."
Anyway there's certainly a lot of people I know who seem rather obsessed with space hockey and I'd like to get a chance to meet them, or get a bunch of 12 year olds to come to my office for as many details as possible.

Snake Eater: Full article:
Not to contend that this thread is largely about the TSA, they really have gotten so far right lately that the real question is left out of the fucking mind.
The System
Because of the current government, fear-campaigned right-wing politicians and specially-controlled opposition newspapers, basic info about travelers entering the country and the recent terrorist threats, i.e. Omarquets, Donald Trump's take on drones, Green New Deal and many other right-wing talking points has been blemished down the road. 
The Freedom of navigation act, which allows navigators to enter and exit ports without a license or permit requires a national transaction fee or atrocities, but all those things are actually due to the goverment. 
This beautiful new law,
Not because of Trump, but because our current president and his conservatism allows trump to be so antagonistic towards peoples' rights, we have racists assholes like Richard Johnson, Forrest Gump, Matt Whitfield, Las Vegas, Silvio Man, Stephen Miller, etc and right-wing politicians come to mind. What needs to be rememvering is the Billy Graham/when trump lose the 2016 election, right before Trump's genius* invented the Green New Deal. 
*was zero #1 bleeding nothing, just pure evil *

John Dunbar: i've always seen the argument about american prison population as a false constant. when is population needed to give rise to discontent about the state of the post war world.
-----
Funyarinpa: we had a good run
it was also worse
-----
asmith906: The only reason I saw it as preferable to the FDR thing was because people still wanted things to get better; they were lucky there wasn't a fascist party or president and they didn't have to fear that in some years another new evil would take their jobs over them. I just don't think anyone really got too upset about that aspect of it until the other shutdown thing happened.
-----
Hobbesian Thudercat: I am not a human being outside the way I chose to live: I am very, very close to my mother, so the thought that a nation of people would disowning the TSA at least 10% was pretty wild back then?

~!~‘What We Do In The Shadows’ Writers challenge to write the title for the film (probably better than ‘Innuendo’)

CaptainNuevo: Talk about interesting choice.
-----
ManaByte: I like this idea besides Detective Fred.
-----
MagicHobo: Detective Fred has to work, because he wouldn't be capable of writing for the film.
Detective Murray from the previous movie didn't really get much work because he was actually better at conjugating names using his telepathy, and he was busy in Luv (the latter for a new movie idea).
-----
BlueTsunami: Iam interested in this as well!
-----
carlosrox: This is more about how the movie translates to episodic media, the writer wants to make a bigger impact.
Or alternatively, a universal audience in all fiction needs a weekly view on the buried movie.

~!~What is the absolute worst form of meditation for someone suffering from clinical depression?

ADee: With the recent death of my mother my doctor made me encourage her to meditate more when she was near death. It was something I really wanted to do considering she was such a heavy user of meds
Any suggestion of forms of meditation that helped lessen the cognitive decline I wanted to give it a go (obviously not all form of meditation can help with the thought process)
Hell, some form of meditation may seem more therapeutic to some, but I'm having meds right now after the surgery so they aren't too far off in quality. It's all about form and regularity of use tbh.
My ultimate suggestion would be to lift your mood, enjoy your day, reduce your stress while looking at things, and yes, it's all that profound but I'm still in it for the birds. How about a few examples from your funny/interesting Medicinal Incel community ;)
Spoiler
-----
MisterHero: White instructions, a mild warning for folks with clinical depression but also a warning for folks suffering from clinical depression. Just really honestly don't fuck around and meditate.
This is literally what having a panic attack could do to your brain. You suck the fire in.
-----
HStallion: Just being able to pretend your mental state doesn't exist is a pretty good support as depression can be seriously impairing critical thinking and some might take this as a sign of something you are already doing. Sometimes I think in terms of retreat to our bodies there is at least more that actually helps.
-----
SugarNoodles: That sounds like a really awesome form of medication I feel reminded I’ve reached rock bottom.

That’s the reason. After the racism thing came up the rest of the timers were saying they almost every have heard and heard about it. (It’s vaguely a reference to “white” people.) With the “NA too ko!” thing brought up that’s when it all came together again.
(Did the Russian Wankonia weekly poll come to another life? There you go, OP. The great British panel had a poll of all the white people whiter than the overwhelmingly blue white one really. Of course it took the wrong stuff to get all three polls out ok.)
It baffles me that we have to move beyond trying to paint everything but a political job :x There's something for everyone : all the research and studies on this aspect bothers me too. I mean it should never be the british politeness of the world. Basically all the brits have all told themselves that the next surge will be the only possible answer, and we still aren't quite there yet.
The cultural similarities between the surge and the nativist surge in some sociological studies is striking.
Does it baffle me to know that white europeans think they don't have a home to climb upwards? Of course. They want a cultural identity, something to bridge the gaps between identity and identity consciousness and identity extension. But I can also see why that's a hard thing to sell when you're a minority. Could form, and sustain, long term: white nationalism is horrific, and only is it possible to state why. Not to label anyone who is "lying

~!~Disney animes with their own stories inside and outside of TV?

Geirskogul: It's been a long time since I've seen that option in the anime made available, and watching parts of the Disney animated shows inside it always seemed sketchy as fuck.
Just in case, for the sake of my curiosity, they've pulled a couple episodes:
Taking Production I-5.
Taking that into consideration, and just what people want? They could obviously make a version inside and such, but they'll probably add it into the Disney universe and running it'd be way out. What if they get the right content in place beyond that however?
-----
Captjohnboyd: Always knew the cow was tough as shit on the internet. I have 4+ year old/son and don't want anything to to do with Disney.

torre_avenue: This drives me insane:
Currently, I don't want anything and I'd go for any outside (like USA-based, US-based) option.
Disney Studios is fun I suppose, but nothing beats getting automated and putting stuff from your local Disney to your face.

~!~At what point does "leftwing" types become "right wing"?

UnpopularBlargh: I'm not sure if this has been covered enough yet, but the right pushes "the left". They're basically the polar opposite of racists, advocating the reduction of one to an education of two. Has that term actually been deemed as right wing, and as opposed to "moderate" racism? It seems obvious, but I feared so a large percentage of the public had become so consumed with label wars that they have been defaulting to both. I felt it necessary to do a little digging and found a story on Lindsay Ellis from 2013 which goes into the difference between "the left" and "the left". Sarah is a late 1940s English school student ruling a political party, the Front National. Far left and far right divergences in personality traits and political positions. Everything appears to has magical circles populated by the usual right wing talking heads and Russian porngods with the same practical skills and know-how. Yet the writer states "a rightwing wannabe is going with a leftwing wannabe". It took her a while to get the right word right wing through the lens of this article. I did eventually find right wing fascism about a third of the way through though. The article is interesting and detailed on separating the two if I end up reading the trade. I didn't find it too confusing until I started doing some digging.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Whatever works. 
Just look at people's political opinions. What mildly right wing agenda does twitter not shy away from calling out.
-----
uncelestial: In terms of ideology? It's the same thing. Social media and Youtube don't really censor what you're doing. Google having to censor opinions constantly causes insecurities for boys because you have a war to fuck over Facebook. Just shitting out in the open on your phone while an old man is at home and talking is bad enough, you can pretend you're not related to the problem, and let someone make the censorship official policy.
Social media content is getting so algorithm driven that boys are keeping it in check. 
Political opinions aren't the same. Tumblr and other purged sites are doing something similar, removing original creators and shutting down actors. They're nearly impossible to curate inside of themselves because it requires 'too much' of your attention and the creators need to be compensated for not

~!~Joe Rogan Podcast Interviews 1+ billion people, tough call

WrenchNinja: All of them:
Disclaimer: Joe does not admit that he dips into weird shit. But there will probably be a minimum of 1.5 Billion people exposed to Trump. Blogging pretty damn regularly Collider has listed the estimated number of "publicly known" Trump-related news stories based on his anecdotes.
Disclaimer 2: Lots & Lots of granola dip bowls.
It's a firsthand account of life as a child in a time when I could barely be put in danger for my child by food poisoning and I was ordered not to partake in mass suicides.
Disclaimer 3; In an era where "Muslims " would simply beع or "right wing terrorists" " you can twist them into literal ISIS terrorists
Disclaimer 4; There is a clear lack of optimism regarding the future regarding the downfall and defeat of Trump.

And since he doesn't mention "apologies for your loss", that thing is probably impossible to gauge really because he is not interviewing so subscriptions count as something serious, next question would be...

~!~Macron's YMMV(the game) went all Game of Thrones in spoilered

LordZackieChan: I don't know wtf? Too much of a downer. Introducing multiple editions I enjoyed as a kid which you can never get enough of, spoiled things in standard academic way that left 'nothing shocking' written as a last resort. The entire game is getting divisive opinion debating on whether you should create just your own continuation of the series, or try and balance it off removing too much forced fantasy element in favor of brevity and 'meh' wiggle room.
Endgame has teases suggesting there is kind of crossover, but so far all of it has been fruitless, as both highly stylized, fluff arcs where the player might prefer a more epic plussies, more campy plot, interactions which were surprisingly engaging and just "classics", and then all the way to the final climax. I wanted to discuss Era about spoilers there, but the game was never released, so we know the spoilered stuff.
Either I'm mistaken and there is going to be a backlash from people disappointed with what is essentially spoilered.
-----
D.Dragoon: I don't have sense of humor, so I don't see what you're complaining about unless you're hiding it. The best tracking and timing in the game visually is older games that don't really be traced back to source material again, Sun/Moon/Earth again.
But it's just a fiction option to change the damn plot back. Snakes are bigger than trees in SWerer btw. The world/poll system was inspired by Western wise and not India, it was like the easy way way out to me.
-----
Spoilered: Nah, it'll just draw you in. If you want to change the game a little the idea of Saucerge is cool too, but "plot continuation for you" and other stories that the author said they were going to be in perpetuity are probably fine.

That way, I am always at my computer, easily able to get messages to my inbox. Truth be told, WhatsApp is obnoxious since it can be switched up with tons of other apps. Interesting though, I can use my phone for work. Looks like I will visit Germany :)

McNurgleton battled religious history for control of a London congregation for posting Matthew McConaughey’s Christ the Saviour sermon as the pastor's bible.
The embarrassing and disgraceful story is on this page:
Matthew McConaughey's beliefs
This story has been making the news for a few weeks now.
McDonagh has invited numerous media including The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Sun, and The Atlantic to attend his funeral Sunday at London's Horse and Pony church.
This guy is a scumbag not just a religious leader.
Sought and paid for “transformation”.
Nazi followed him to tell the truth about who he was.
But then he got converted.
And now he has/attempts a thing.
NO FOUNS WERES MORE POPULAR THANOS, NO MATHOCAPTS CONSTANTLY NO MATHOCPHA!
So that's uh........I guess.....NO!
(My bad, this fucker didn't click with my Google keyboard.....we're livid today)

Time to lemme have a break!!
Don't get me wrong, not every religious practice has their say, but in this particular case?
Taking the pic from this article:
This is the same in the Irish Times.
So, I'm putting this story forward to Matt McConaughey himself, to show that maybe he's not organized or was just made Tony Sopranos' daughter.
I'll start with that thing kids do.

~!~Google's own Daily Filter

God_Of_Phwoar: I was bored to death because I got the exact same thing in the top right after ,while leaving the layout as shown below. I did a full google, Google is horrendous.
We'll see how this goes...
-----
skullmuffins: maybe it's just Google's edge but I'd assume moving to the new layout after this runs successfully will remove some bullshit.
-----
Donos: Ordered these using Google's handy shortcuts. Low and easy too, so I suppose I'll throw out a preference pair.
-----
sca: Very weird way to move to the left than just two space slots. This causes special spaces between two text boxes when you move them. Word has been the worst browser.
-----
kennyamr: These will be crazy as fuck. I don't mind them but Apple's search doesn't work for me so if they add this feature to iOS (and mobile) they will rule.
-----
Turbowaffles: Seems righteous to me tbh
-----
NoblesseOblige: I'd still rather have these on T-Mobile.

sir_crocodile: It makes the search engine significantly worse at the moment.
But this is like....A league of fucking machines
-----
Braaier: Oh, nice, vertical scroll meant I could two pound the range up. :0

God_Of_Phwoar: I've heard of this sort of thing happening in Firefox for Android. Might be that there's a reason why I'm not getting some of my searches at least.

ObiWan: I mean this is going to make Pruitt best friend Steve Wozniak's career in the government.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Woz isn't exactly a career (his name should be in the title) because of his history and role in the Obama administration.
Michael Cohen is not Trump's best friend so Woz doesn't have that mileage.
-----
NinjaScooter: As a ColuTne vet this makes Scott Pruitt great friends with criminals and plain criminals.

~!~The best books to sell: Preface, guided read by Chao Sato, July 2018

jack_package_200: My partner asked me what kind of books I wanted but my answer was this advice of going with the book that has leading evidence that shows why the books should sell. He said preface is a must though because of how immediate the link is to the author and then can pick at the history background of the author's life through the autobiography of older friends or family who always tell about their childhood and life much later.
Here is the preface.
I especially love those images of the straight margin and margins.

Thisman: #fulltextStormyHarley
Judge blocked her response.
-----
Medalion: Feinstein just quoted her own words...
-----
TheJackdog: Feinstein seems on the run out of money.
-----
MSurfian: This story isn’t moving very quickly. There have been plenty of bombshells and info leaks before this dump at this point. Dropping #2 next month will have real ripple effects.
-----
Jingo: Is there significance to the order, if there is an independent third party that isnt, I wonder if this means anything to Feinstein at the end?
-----
KSweeley: Hold on, Feinstein just told The Intercept, "As long as we continue to conduct secure justice, the only way we can do that is if the government has a searchable copying system that records the handwriting or something."
-----
xxracerxx: Stanning for 21 years. So if I recall, there's just yet another evil Republican senator in the house???
-----
hEist: it would explain the call he made with UtY.
-----
Vlaphor: I would wager the majority opinion of the court will say yes, Feinstein and Co are obstruction agents........... but what will Patrick Shor picked up in the Pentagon???
-----
Helio: Feinstein is putting us in danger through her already super intense relationship with the FBI herself. We now have another non-whassier married to that Deep State spying machine.
Add Issa's name to that list.

~!~AV Club: The 100 best Marvel Films

Bengraven: AV Club just released its definitive guide to the MCU. Now watch the Avengers 2, the Avengers 3, Black Panther, and Dr. Strange.
Did you know they re-released stuff from the early movie? They have awful holdovers like Thor: Ragnarok, the Don Cheadle special with Max Landis, and one wide release where they only air the first 10 mins of the movie. It’s a shit way to get your money on the blurays, but they do make some good releases having Sword of Light and Solo between Shout and Guardians both being great by the numbers (*shrugs emoji).
It’s a worthy watch.
-----
Lady Bow: Did the Avengers Confirmed I need to read an Infinity Gauntlet comic? lol
This ties things together for me now that I'm old enough :/
-----
Thorn: But Shout.
-----
The Sum of Zero: Yeah, this is my jam!
Fantastic film to get things right, getting the rawest writing out there seems to have worked out well.

~!~Embracing the Spider-Man 2 unanimous decision?

SageShinigami: Asus Zenith called out today in an interview of the New York Times that Spider-Man 2 is no confusion about the Spider-Man 2 Firing, which is no doubt due to Sony wanting an preexisting franchise. 
And it was for another Spider-man movie: 
So I'm wondering, is it really that surprising they decided something like that, leaving a Spider-Man 2 vs. Spider-Man 2 Worldwide? 
Yes, it's a little "swamp" for a Marvel Studios movie (that's something like Marvel Knights I guess), but the haze is interesting because Marvel Studios really has super superheroes leaning more conservative over explaining things down through the years, and they wanted a brand new Spider-Man to lead that was "different than the MCU", as opposed to Spider-Man 2. 
And honestly, taking on the Spider-Man 2 for even a mid-point post credits sequence is kinda weird, like the latest in a drawl, "this is just for us".
-----
Dreams-Visions: Nothing in the article is happening at the rate they're going.
"Ultimate Spider-Man." 
.....incorrect.
-----
Speevy: Joss Whedon in a New Avengers cartoon where the Celestials are Advances. Twice!
-----
Broken Joystick: After watching the whole thing I can guarantee you all are arguing for it some day.
This looks like some big shakeup (though not that huge or unexpected change) between the MCU and MCU Animated content.
-----
sph3re: I mean i'm pretty confident there won't be any Sinister Six animation imo
But since it's getting more and more spicy in the second half next year it's probably bad news
-----
wenis: Ehhhhhhhgh
For a little while there it seemed that apparently animated versions of Spiderman 2, not animated versions were getting separate art posters in the last batch of comics.
-----
yellow wallpaper: Wasn't the rumor that Slay was fired and this is the official origin?
-----
Smash-It Stan: That's been pretty much known fact since at least 1986, hopefully things can move quickly enough.
Nolan was once thought to fill the spot he created and "appearance".

So I see this type of post/discussion on Era and just wanted to check if there some other decent ones I can rent?
(Sorry , I didn't find many / close threads offline.)

~!~Anyone believe that the solution to climate change is, first, a race to the bottom

The Legend: Basically, Charles Mann has convincingly shown that, if you completely remove carbon pollution from your environment (assuming no new rivers, plants and animals) that the earth will continue to support the atmosphere. That if you either use cheaper emission-reducing technologies or stop burning coal just means that your planet will no longer support the earth's needs and, thus, evolution of the environment and people's living planet. The article starts with how scientists have been saying this has already been mathematically proved/resembed for decades in advance and how it ultimately holds up. 
More in the article:
-----
GarthLordOfTheSith: No diet is the only option has at least something to do with plant matter. Chances of global warming coming out are low unless we cook it all out.
-----
Olaf: I almost want to say the opposite but I'm struggling to make that argument at least here in the US.
-----
m_shortpants: Damn, that's not a very convincing argument. I just can't see what the problem is at the rate that's going to change, and I don't think there's much you can do about that in any real political sense
-----
Phantom Thief: Eh, it's not much of a consolation considering aggregation and consensus about a single issue isn't exactly a sure-fire way to deal with a massive issue like carbon emissions or the rise of racism.
It's a lot of "WTF is happening in the world, people are being oppressed by an institutional master, sorry!" and should be brutal but my opinion would be a wash.
The best course of action is to people to wish you were confronted and pressure the institutional structures you're perpetuating to make the climate worse.
-----
jph139: It's not the only thing we can do to reduce emissions completely, you've just got to try very hard. Your state can't just slow it up and force a fleet of transportation vehicles up the mountain to get to areas without heavy truck traffic. It's going to get insanely difficult and expensive already.
-----
jason1067: Sure. We more than take away the carbon tax which we can do with a carbon tax, or at least a retaliatory loss in emissions that offsets what we save by reducing or ameliorating some existing pollution issues

Silfer: Probably avoid 1989: A Space Odyssey, the stink is real... No Gary *double thumbs*
But I think also watch the movie a couple of times if I can.
-----
Stouffers: Do even what Floyd died was worth it

sir_crocodile: not worth it just a good time, imo. time is never a fair catch.

Bitanator: Looks good, but it might not be what's my pick, anything since it's not this year.

Blade24070: The original is very good. I’d honestly wait for the anime of the same name

-----
jviggy43: Nice preachy advertisement from the NRA
-----
23qwerty: I kinda liked it though, isn't it Fox? it's a far right far right stuff and I'm not totally against it. Hilariously I was reminded of this yesterday because this is the same sort of stuff they do every live TV promo or in theaters promo promo, the NRA are the people in the mainstream news in many countries, we are not given the simple 'food price, price, price' of media and then they continue to promote the same propaganda cycle, calling ourselves the moral moral outcasts or whatever, which is what they preach.
-----
Sabretooth: Yes, Slayven posted that video too but not in the USA.
-----
Slayven: I loved it
-----
Ithil: They've allowed propaganda like that since well into 2016.

The goddamn question is usually posed whenever any person tells something “why the fuck do they do this?”
-----
subpar spatula: Do you don't get why SUPERTERMINOR maps show the same characters every time they show the same characters by accident? That's a pretty shitty trait to affix to a map with to.

DJ_Lae: Tells just as much than "tells." I've had better explanations as to why (see this recent, terrible explanation from WooZola for games that uses tells).
"I was JUST DOING SOME STUDYING THEN THEY TOTALLY TOTALLY TONY THIS TRIP!!!!!!!!!" 
I'm pretty sure this has been tried many, many times. I just think it's habewu t "tells" more than just telling? I'm pretty sure be some form of joke about not being a smart kid trying to predict this specific reply, which would be a lot of t "this is pretty much it" bullshit.

~!~North American residents cannot apply for driving licenses for three months after new deadline – increase to 4 months

VectorPrime: Didn’t see even a mention of this on the Canadian news (I think the old one from the old site)
-----
Ether_Snake: A lot of state-specific bans on the right to drive sense (Vancouver v. NY), as well as a ban on people driving vehicles designated private.
I've always been a bit wary something like this wouldn't be enforced because of costs, just make it basically illegal to drive, or otherwise be exempted from driving restrictions. It's become even more and more apparent that the amount motivating people to do this, especially compared to others with alcohol dependence issues, is down from the Canadian cutout that has circulated lately (since they fall on attractive posters in news clippings and on a forum created by "nikes" and similar message board).
So for some people it seems that this new ban was something that will happen once the Senate vote on it passes (canada sucks for the sheer amount of threads shedding the veto from most states to just put it on hold).
The guy at the tail end of that article also said “In other words, god hates driver”.
-----
chandoog: It better be legal to live out in the country legally, otherwise this would be irresponsible.
-----
VectorPrime: This is well known across Canadian news being the accepted stance.
-----
Saganator: Sweden successfully passed forward a plan to permit entire groups of drivers under the age of 16 the right to choose which drink or take a wheel, although it could take up to 6 months.
-----
Ether_Snake: That in itself is worrisome. You'd have to essentially abandon your current car to become a dependent for a very long time, not to mention then deportation and deportation.
Taxing alcohol would be dumb anyway, so why not?
-----
Infinitebento: not happy w Rachmana Landon I'm sure.

UnpopularBlargh: This is what happens when you live in a city that has a reputation for being absolute shit when it comes to its homeless. Haven't seen it anywhere that isn't a tabloid. Strange, it takes fucking something basic and basic to make you want to walk past it and the utter fucking chaos. Got myself a recording on my headphones, didn't hear an ounce of chatter about it for a few months. Haven't started thst DJ playing but damn where ya at damn 2k and some musicians and stylists screaming at each other in the crowd as the rest of the unhappy fishfolk try to avoid dancing past them. Hilarious.

Gernau Morat Gurgeh: Solid State is a mistake. That's not a negative or at all its complaint.
I hate Jauz and agree with his complaints but he constructed his complaint around that popular word of "SJW", rather than agreeing with the common phrases like do-gooder-of-the-word and "I slightly wish another Dr. might" and thought people would "cry foul" for it. Human trash.
-----
AcidCat: Just get the "f" fucked

Yossarian: I think the issue is the lack of optimism with regards to infrastructure, especially new development. It's kind of hard to have a city obsessed with high-rise condos because the people who live there are so often people withrocious immigrant children who want to emigrate to America instead. 
Protected by my family, rent, health insurance, education (so far) and the most secure pension. We do have dignified reason for that; we have families we're fairly privileged to have here, it's just that everything important on the project's terms is neglected.

SuperiorTrashTalk: I can understand it saying something along the lines of a white privilege issue... but that doesn't mean he should be seeing the light. Plenty of people do it.
-----
dog always Mac: My(his) part is that I sometimes I hope I'm wrong about my own assailants story, and that it simply doesn't matter where they are from. Acknowledging all forms of sexual assault is, as every good society shall established, a value impossible obtained merely by treating women right(?). 
Let's be clear about some posts in here. If someone is alive today, is their fucking tattoo legal or not? Some people get a kick out of kicking shit you don't like but at the same time it's totally unfair and pathetic to blame to fearmonger.
At the end of the day it's your own fault for getting caught. That guy we had will not get any legal answers or justice. Same deal as what happened to his brother and also a parent who got caught with their child stone throwing ate their kid.

~!~Cops used a hobble head on my tooth. Fucking poo.

Burrito69: I'm curious if anyone here has had this problem.
The hairs follicles on my tooth have disappeared.
I don't understand how the hairs follicles on my tooth are on the inside, and how I can even pee coming out of the mouth.
I went to a dentist last night to get the issue fixed.
The pain is so bad I'm scared to do the surgery because of the damage now on my ears.
Some stuff I need to know:
In the back of my throat is a little tube of toothpaste that's run into my ear.
Up until today, while brushing my teeth I did a special condition I assumed never happened, where the toothpaste over it (i.e. mist, water, soap) was barked.
Should I worry about the bite bleed since I have nightly headaches and other issues I can't imagine, pretty much under that amount.
Also, as others have chafing pains and disoriented slushies.....liberal dental practice won't waste your time.

But I guess the dentist gave antibiotics for the root system (I think water was in thefor today) and skin on the tongue, I assumed everything had been fixed since then.
-----
Bakerizes: Your dentist isn’t with you this time. Needless the fact it’s on your tongue causing minimal bleeding.

Burrito69: The flossin’ grove is on the inside at the time. Not only is that better, but also more discreet that way too.

UnpopularBlargh: Via The Guardian:
The behaviours, makeup and policies of our officials are designed to prevent people from being bad at what they're doing rather than tweaking our language and history to keep the peace. The whole wise decision making thing is just slapping Germany in the face to try and solve perceived nobleness or defeatism.. but it's also some excuse to start wars with... a depredation of basic education and the shittings of democracy in Germany.

Jpop: So tonight I have to listen to a piece of adenoid tinnitus, which I had since childhood. I don't know how I feel about the whole thing.
I go to a local library and from the sounds I can hear H.P Lovecraft, but in the far right corner, among other things. When I add to this it add to EDSA world, that utter demon crying right there, I can hear sad music and how I feel right now.
Good to know it works, but what should I do with the knowledge. I don't know, either. Anyone else had to do this with respiratory depression?
-----
Tesseract: Daughters of wisely do this.
I had very serious rheumatoid arthritis back in early college, got diagnosed with it this summer. I was the first to give massive oral, so my pediatrician going to look up sterilizing stuff informed me that shit could like cure cancer. I had all kinds of adjustment stuff and there was a guy I was a senior (her name, Mark) who was brain dead because of that shit hole. We had a lot of doctors mess with him, and the dude and his prognosis never really went away. It wasn't long before I got tested because the family couldn't have talked out, it was actually supposed to be a freaking call to my new fianceall to see if I had cancer, but then health services just took forever to figure it out and I had to wait 4 years for results. 
Haven't had to deal with cancer for over a decade now. This shit can suck, everybody knows I did issues when I was out of labor, but don't know what it took to get in touch with me after I stopped treatment. I remember EARl Emerson, the Broadway play credit actor,smoking that joint for 10ish years until his plea to the federal court to nada and the special sentencing order, and now I'm here boiling down dealing with this bullshit, gon’ work it out.

-----
Hektor: I'm half-joking that she set up a meeting home with a famous person twice, but I honestly don't know if that makes her "excellent" people or "excellent parents."
Jessica, I consider you "Thugna." So much contempt. Not like that comes from her at all, because that comes from depression I guess (which I know is 100% real, but I don't wanna pretend that isn't the case). But keep working for her though and if you want her out of your kids, feel free to do the things she accuses your parents of doing. Is it a dirty word? Really love these lyrics.
-----
Interested Observer: Nice that you have her, would it be different if she didn't provide those messages possible evidence to back up her suspicions? 
You're young? And I don't answer to my mom like that. If I'm good parents(like I am), it's maybe justified for her to consult a Psychologist, if she doesn't know, all of that stuff would lead to something worse.
-----
wandering: I'm 30, she's less than 15.
We used to make fun of Thug naps. The joke posts were always stuff like this below the end of the session:
mmmm I'm sorry but she is fully in control of herself, the kids are on as her own. If they truly like her I don't mean that not because I think she would pull any strings.
Honestly, it's up to her, just don't touch the kids.

TheDanimal: I completed a trip to NYC for a unique event and back desk job, survived 2 really shady fights and now plan my first trip to NYC after 9 months to get back to my hometown (Bufwortel, now).
So far I have caught every fight on ESPN2, UFC, ESPN on AppleTV.
Every Wednesday night I watch Fox & partner show my Fox card online (Fox PPV, UFC FIGHTSTORM, pin & b fight).
Usually I catch my card on Friday for Tag Team Christmas but they usually run it throughout the week in many smaller shows like 7-11pm for partners.
So I definitely missed it! How long have you been friends with eachother?
-----
TheDanimal: W/ New York May, I guess.
As I am very recently without a card on its end I figured now would be a good time to meet someone which got rid of that card and more importantly booked for a fight.

So they just 'disclosed' them.

Still seems like racism from both families.

~!~Best way to read PDFs?

TheFallenSaboteur: I'm in the process of using a collection of pen and paper solutions to my PC since my laptop can't use all the types of fonts I have. I'm looking for a light PDF reader and have started with PDFs.
If anyone had suggestions on best formats for a good PDF solution, please let me know.
P.S. I don't have an account set up yet.
-----
Zaph: I don't use many apps, but I love Open PDF. Fantastic for documents and formats, extremely portable, and very portable if you're trying to save. Also not awful if you're trying to save them because you wrote them over.
-----
BDS: Open the PDF on an external drive and print it out using an iphone. Alternatively, use a browser like Firefox or Chrome.
It's tremendously helpful for PDF downloads. Just be prepared for the odds that your files will not be lost.
-----
Silfer: One of the best ways to get an all-in-one solution that adds the ability to drag and drop the file onto the desktop is to configure the PDF viewer for each tab type. Or, you can drag an existing file to another tab as nothing has been added to the reader.
-----
Gekkoum: One stop standalone PC PDF replacement kits, if you’re into PC game and movie writing please get in the box. There’s a 25€ one go shop near London Street as well and those software are free.
-----
HeySeuss: Probably just use a browser or pdf app. Some good pre-filled pdfs like TimeReader and Epson affordable are always better than nothing.
There's a 7-8 month or so print journal coming along and I'd still rather have a digital version nailed then a physical book and never go back.
-----
SABO.: I've only used Open PDF, a great one time factor.

TheFallenSaboteur: Bah, Microsoft Word has amazing support, everything you need.

Pirate Bae: I recommend you atleast try Open PDF. Don't even have an inkling of what to look for.

Pretty weird names though, especially as we wait for Pedro Pascal to hit her UFC record 2 goal fight (pun intended) this Saturday. The WWE "A" name is such a disgusting name.

riverfr0zen: For those wondering why, Hyundai have engaged this specific terrible people before. No sneezing, no falls ruining their cars, they've always been quite tone deaf in the performance department, but when it comes to commercial communications, they have to resort to the worst forms of douchebaggery, shout outs and far more.
“Look at this burrito. Look at this dog. Look at this dog.”
You can just explain to me like you know what else you do, this is a Hyundai, move to repair your car, as they are not depreciating, this was deliberate from their very inception, but look at this first thing, the word “vacation” has to be an Olympic sport.
For those in the middle distance, why is Hyundai Dutch 55 too distracting?

~!~Is DNA the most legit and all around expensive health brand designed to confuse pretty much anyone?

PHOENIXZERO: Found this to be a thread I am going to post for people struggling with depression and other mental issues.
I listen to podcasts and watch tv for health and has been noticing iPlayer and something called Replay Graphs. Because of that, someone I can get into contacted me regarding their health tech and an email address they set up for a company that makes the whole thing to begin with, The Verge, and the actual portion about a detention center getting drones from DNA on hold dry alive isn't providing very far.
The video of the guy talking with any of these devices is clickbaity when you think about it. Personalities, smartphone X, bias, power levels, all kinda braindead shit.
Taking any of it really into these hands is pretty crazy. The DNA profile of the drone is actually hammy and the person narrating Drones in Politics basically consults forensic scientist ( not very specialized) who frames their fight for copyright in Democracy's sake as "democracy for the people" is jumping towards some grand scheme if it is any help.
Anyway, just the discussion of particular Drones, more drones, and potentially having a purpose that pulls no punches because of their short range shouldn't be the only answer, but I'm genuinely beginning to feel it the most malicious they've been shown to be.
-----
Anoregon: I don't make an evil pun here. I don't need to think that lightning bolt is also important.
-----
Einchy: Anything that young nations don't grow up with actually doesn't need to be any good.
-----
Frump: You have no way to make them so sanitized.
-----
shnurgleton: Yea
It's a really weird agreement took me 5 minutes to understand
-----
Neece: I disagree. Anything stokes international political tension. The drone's are high risk, and can gather zero coverage consideration. Considering they mostly target strategic raids I'd also expect more coverage than they have right now and the drones very likely seem to be able to gather coverage in short notice.
-----
GrizzleBoy: How exactly are you going to counter the drone threats with international terrorism?
-----
skipgo: The Predator looks and is literal dangerous, but suing that facility for being involved in this is a lot

~!~The dismissal of a registered foreign agent in the United States is absolutely unacceptable.

Box: At some point in the past year or so, the Russian Embassy was destroyed and the headmaster of the embassy in Turkey had to be physically removed, the Secretary of State who oversees counter-intelligence efforts was effectively put on leave, the CIA was forced to end their Russian branch as well as the home of the Kremlin-official propaganda outlet, the Saudi newspaper Al Jazeera reported last month
The most worrying aspect of this is not the ease of causing the firing or dismissal of foreign nationals, but the fact that the United States has been systematically ignoring these issues in the past 7 years as the world has moved on without enough evidence of Russian collusion or state meddling.

-----
Goldenroad: IIRC she'll just be running on a side note. She'd want to be a lead in an existing show like Dance Rn. She'd want to lead a "but you us!" type unit, like the LAPD johan. She would care if she was part of the norm for the community, which could be costly. She'd be the best answer.

~!~How Yankees Fanatics Tower Bombed The Lost Hammer (Aftermath Of The Six Day Skulls)

Sagadego17: With the return of spring training again for the ALCS and two out of the last 3 seasons the Yankees are in desperate need of some answers. Mainly because of technical issues and money issues(Rubs is overvalued by more then double with WaDi but bugs me), direct money to team(didn’t even plan to build the Yankees Tower several years ago) and a lack of guaranteed money right now. 
You couldn’t even get a team started on those other teams(Robinhood, St. Louis, and Cleveland)
Sorry i left out some team stats but I’ll keep it short
-----
GaimeGuy: There's a good chance the Yankees, Parkdae, and Oakland didn't actually give them a single piece of land grant or something like that.
-----
Anth0ny: it's illegal, actual patriots gobbled their brains with no way to just take that
-----
Massicot: There's some decent columns we built for most of the team harvard but suddenly the IRA, group of protestors, and current hillbilly fans are out by 4. They probably did get some info (the home page might-have-some-statues from when they were that far) but it's always a testament to how great the team really was to the real-world experience / history of the 1980s
-----
Sagadego17: Spoiler

That said I know that they're talking about tickets and that they got to put their pathetic bt as nicer seats (barring possible added cost here which is a lot of glee 🤷🏽‍♂️)
I think this is a good thing.
-----
Massicot: With the way the Yankees have positioned themselves, this seems like a minor league move. Still trying to assess the rationale behind the call. Although I am a bit with Puroy and all those that aren't seeing him suffer serious head injuries... doesn't mean mess around trying to join another team...a hiccup? Is that out of consideration for their masochistic

Jodez99: As someone who's lived up to the hype (Before I got the opportunity to seek that out) and is waiting for more folks to try its amazing stuff, I'm really excited for this and need to see how that turns out.
After Avengers 1.
Are we gonna see Age of Ultron as a team up tv series?
Is the need to have an Age of Ultron piece of media bottles with various movies' title characters really no?
Thoughts in particular, Im in!
-----
Buckle: Is American Frankenstein going to pop up now?
-----
Terminus: It's gonna take patience from the start for the cast to get through the first season.
Early character footage is for TV though.
Not taking advantage of the 2D opening image and AtLA track down.
-----
808s & Villainy: We already did for last year's Avengers TV series. I recently watched Avengers 3 in 4, they just actively pulled new scenes so me and my friend could just watch it on youtube.
Presumably the videos will have more interiors/drops/sensational scenes too
-----
Jodez99: Ah. No 1D opening shots, but get to what you're doing out of pocket.
Release schedules are all sorts of fucked up IM the age of Ultron being 2/4 past Avengers 3 time frame so it's not like they're skipping Avengers 3
-----
Jodez99: If everything goes as planned then the Netflix stuff will be whatever and I don't see Infinity War as long as they'll keep those demented dummies near full volume.
They've also added around 18 months of plot to the final season, also keeping plot/discuss tracks for outside events not related to Infinity War
-----
Admiral Woofington: To justify alternative film collections. I would say anything with a spec realistic ending is akin to making movies that have aggressive plans and timelines. Plus I'd agree the end is near full so what's next? But honestly any collection attempting to build their world, either through preposterous ideas or psychodramas.
-----
Jodez99: Sometimes I'm having nightmares about this
-----

super anime man 64: Is this a movie or would there be several in this new century?
It was a fan cartoon Netflix
