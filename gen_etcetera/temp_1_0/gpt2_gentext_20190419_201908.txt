~!~New Asperger's Study Where You Live counts more misery and quandrums own a scumbag

bardo: title brought up a few days ago, I fully intend to read through the article... just got around to finishing it now... I'll try to find anything that isn't exactly what I just quoted. Or, I'll take my time, and remember it.
-----
Kasai: Fuck Uh Me and You, and Ahh, the Man Who Laughs
For the sake of just plain Juncker & co, fuck that study.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Golden Fuckstick.
Spoiler
-----
capitalCORN: Parents of quandrums? What the fuck?
-----
fanboi: I have a wishy theorical:
-----
NakedSnek: This survey will definitely have more sociopaths, makes sense to me, especially as we move onto the internet and the talking points of social media.
-----
sibarraz: Juncker spoke from a very legal sounding thing and that as well, being German doesn't trump this craziness and is really better
-----
Zexion: I've found that over time most people will think; "oh when I was the one greeting greeting in the language I learned," because just about all people do that in this country.
The notion that you can't be a parent and really act like a guardian rings a bell with many of your not so nice sounding english friends with children.
Free Belgium you brits, and good sir and neighbour will be good too for you too.

corasaur: sounds like what an american web psychiatrist professor once said.

Zen: Because there's no logic in it. The sole purpose of life is to not die. In essence, it's a desire to not live.
Its main function isn't to make you happy, its purpose is to determine your life qualityively that's what you're born with.

~!~The Daily Beast: Why Being White is Not a Thing...

Jacobson: Taking a look at the history behind how white people were excluded from the "greats", why being a white person is not the same as being black, queer or any other minority group.
Insulted white people are, unfortunately, joining in on our "backwards love"
As a response, being gay is "pretty full bodied" and any new group celebrating "traditional roots values" the next time they attempt to become middle class Again, holding racist and ignorant views on race is not the same as growing up to bigotry and racism down to white origin.
 These are not mutually exclusive points of view...
-----
SilentRob: This is a decent video (lols a bit old, but I learned a bit of the issues around being bullied by various races in the 80's and 90's).
Watching news about areas of America being so white/etc that even day in and day out is weird, you're teased, insulted, and judged for it when you're encountered by people of the same race.
But be a goddamn ally and speak the truth, good ones, because we're all gonna get our feelings hurt.
Always good to hear good people’s viewpoints diversify a conversation.
-----
kadotsu: (also black) and (queering)
-----
Nick Nehidnyk: I'm not defending this very much, but I think I agree with what you're saying. Being treated as lesser nature is not in itself then.
-----
Verelios: Because, as a single white person, I have the issue that I feel like white people are mistreat others because we generally look down on them. And we don't talk about it as much as more inoffensive or otherwise.
To this being a point that I'm thinking about maybe if this were a course same race method thing you would hold similar views too? Like is it not? Possibly: I sometimes call them slurs for expressing values not their own? Sure. But being treated like an insult for being white isn't despicable to me.
-----
A Fish Aficionado: This video was featured during a Pride parade in the 70s.
It isn't exactly dropping eyes, but I will bring up articles and videos on this topic.

~!~Trump, may be forced to step aside due to losing economy, 2020 Democratic Presidential candidate Evan O'Briel excels

Inuhanyar: Didn't see a thread about this, shame if that's not good.
Still can't see it myself, but O'Briel seems like the right person for this. They seem to be slowly catching up over some candidates, there is hope for them this time.
I prefer Trump's but I'm also not losing any goodwill has think he's gonna stick around in power.
Does anyone else here know who this is talking about? Could really use some more good shit

Marcellus Wallace: Can you even run on social issues?

Cocaloch: I've only seen Professor X, so I don't know, but I really don't care.

Ex-Actarus: Isn’t he just a fucking idiot chess master who can’t play a sport?
-----
Loxley: You can't run on social issues. You can't run on social issues...

Nope.

Inuhanyar: I'm all for it to grow but "If I lose the economy" is insufficient information, let's see if they are able to "Get This Over" orLet's see how "This Is" goes....
-----
Kodros: The job has been 100% clear the last 42 years, back in 08 and 09 when the GOP took over congress and dems were in all dire straits, it hasn't even recovered from one given the amazing growth of the previous 44 years. I remember being asked the same question but my white republican boss was visibly hazing me at points.
-----
ApatheticDoom: When can we get a thread of this nature? That's what might help the country stabilize. The world's Obama. Not "so bad we can't fight it."
-----
CatAssTrophy: I think Blame Spacey would have been a good fit. His record on tackling issues like this is kinda concerning, especially for someone who puts himself out there and claims he cares about actual issues. I mean, I don't know but I don't know that this may not be malicious intent. And I am just saying more discussion to be given on this issue due to personal circumstances. Seems like Chimmy roommate was trying to make due with Chim

~!~Will the MCU overdo and bogage Captain America's first movie?

RastaMentality: So if this was before the Guardians and Jim hawking hanoke, I might see it more. MCU recently the likes a lot of smaller seemingly more successful movies most will probably have a lesser wait before seeing it. 
Gotta be sure though, if it turns out to be a poorly made film with new ideas. The premise alone is laughable, keep it to smaller budget and adapt from the books once all the fan effects are gone or the movies become stale for me.
-----
Cream: Yes
Umm we have to binge a ton of movies and mix them with some television shows not to mention probably do foreign stuff Monkeys
Sims TV shows are good about this too
-----
Deleted member 14002: Screen Rant
-----
ArchedThunder: Yep.
-----
Stiler: Doesn't seem like it is recent, but I grew up with it watching it. I would say give it chances. But really there needs to be a Rick wuss show made by the actors who grew up on MTV.
-----
More_Badass:ablishing a sustained narrative where competing interests play a big role
-----
Smurf: How the fuck does some dumb spoiler talker K WhiteLead die?
-----
AlteredBeast: I can only imagine how tired WB must have been after Jim Carrey-Sneigle died the rumored Joker for the next ten years, bested the Dark Knight and was second year producer of a Spider-Man movie, both of which were falling under the radar on Disney (aside from X-Men), and kids were hemmed down and despondent after the PG-13 Marvel movie floated before it
That said, I’m still pretty interested in whether we can dargle this in and look for the universe over. Especially if they bring back the Cheetah King?
-----
Stiler: Superman Returns vibes? Wut??
-----
Vic_Viper: More hope for WW then Captain America because we didn’t actually get that, but I’d love for IW to be wrapped up very quickly. Maybe Doom as well. 
But yeah, I voted for Kabal. Good to see him get some recognition for something he did once the WM was loading. I still do hope

berzeli: Meanwhile, every other week it looks like the Chinese take of "The Little Mermaid" is making more than "The Avengers." Rumors are that Frozen 1/2, Ragnor 2/2, Carpet, and Goofy were all underwater and tracking to fail; if The Incredibles 2 gets 10% more wins over a worldwide average then so what's the bonus?

~!~National Novel Writing Month 2018

PaulloDEC: The theme is
A little about the participating authors (not enough to make a big deal, I know some); lots of good stories! But what are the biggest areas of focus? I'll share some maybe a few, though hopefully there's more elsewhere. I'd love to have some discussions about them, however. Just don't get too stuck in too many rabbit holes that the OP listed.
The theme starts at the beginning of the word, usually though, so to speak. " 
How do people get started?
So I've been a big fan of contests (that's an escapism thingy I guess). What I struggled with in trying to follow up a serious writing problem, and somewhat fix[ edit : haven't pickled yet). I'm like ok, whatever. Fallout 76 prototyped my idea for how these contests work (with lots of thought by the community's contribution I guess), but Fallout 76 isn't one.
I think the best way to get ideas for games without needing an outstanding story/characters. Perhaps have a comic in your portfolio. Perhaps a giant wordpress blog. This is summer time again for us summer reading faces.
Aka I actually grew pretty cool for them, lol (Secret Santa still looks t sexy!
-----
Gundam: Every year, I was designing a cheat sheet for Ultimate Dungeons and Dragons. Drafted it out at everyone's house. It's good fun now back home.
-----
jwk94: Maybe there's another thread that people didn't see?

PaulloDEC: Another year comes very close, so I'll add it to the summer memory.
E: finished (almost) finished.
But I'll say it stands as one of the best gaming experiences ever (the words and then the context are phenomenal). 'cus it's sobering to see someone clearly burned by what caused Pacific Rim to be such big success lol

~!~I plan on a wedding in April

NTGYK: My folks noticed I invite too multiple people to my wedding, the reason coming out as trans is that I'm taking more social time with the wedding folk. Anyways, mom is about to have gastronomy, and my wife is one hour away. We're being supportive and supportive of our interests. 
I'll probably do my MOMA stuff, but I'll feel like if I wanted to, I wouldn't. About $30 I spent on rent, $15 on food, $15 on travel. Rent and food expenses already paid off. 
pretty sure it's still all expenses due to a work holiday after the childs come. 
last year we were able to attend over 100 events over the summer, things I spent just using my phone to make up to get the theaters closed. I'll probably just deal with it this year, it's easier to deal with the last few months now, not choosing to attend more my age.
-----
Tragicomedy: Good on you for being supportive. It's not in April, so might wanna jump in, too.
-----
Doc Kelso: Congrats! I just met my mom and my dad this month. She’s been in the hospital since the fall too, so I dunno who she’ll speak to about stuff I’m attending.
-----
GamingGarden: There was a friend who asked me if I wanted to go to her wedding, she's 88. Both are loved and I'm hoping that goes well.

~!~Did you quit your job before being let go? (Details Inside)

Sargerus: It has been a decade since I was promoted on the CPA. But hardships like this are part of human nature.
I have had to lay off most of my family. I haven't hired any people just because.
Some notes:
Have you had the experience of having the same day a restructuring at your previous workplace?
Did you have the hallmarks of management or laid back personality traits? Were they assigned during time?
Were they focused during promotion period? Did their tests or assessment reveal a personality type?
How did your time compare? Did you have to go to multiple areas so your personality can be compared to yours?
Did you get told enough about the course of action and problems you were facing at the previous workplace?
Do you feel regret at taking the job , or did you do a good job doing the new job you thought you could do?
Did all of your issues management related? Do you have a personality from working with others?
Did you feel like you have resources at home to help you resolve personal issues before you look for other work? How did all the contradictancy developed over time?
Thought you seemed insufferable.

I envy my managers. They are better than I think even historically and so much more respected.
-----
JANthArates: Thankfully not. There were loads of opportunities all around the place. A lot of people close to me who I knew.
-----
Wolven Hammer: I hear this all the time but had no idea. The initial days of good jobriefing galore. Lots of great talks on when that contract would be announced, when stuff like this would pop up, how it would be structured and how you would handle it, etc would be prepared.

Switch Back 9: He's my son's father and I want him gone. Its also highly unlikely I would have lost my child before he could take his place.
I'm leaning towards retiring, but it's very possible I could die a week or two earlier if I decide I've had enough stomach acid.
I'm probably over it.

signal: Fox 9 has an interview with Marcy Wheeler, a female 14 year old transgender girl that lives in the DC area.
They talk about how this is a series of "tapes" but apparently people interested in that are crazy. Marcy suggested a solution with a programming that is letting her come in when she wants.
They say there are "semi-transitioning subjects!"

Laserdisk: Good for them.
Just as the parent plead for the child to grow up up to be a good man.
-----
RedBlue: Just so we're clear, I want my child to experience the real world, but all things have consequences. Nothing against children in general but it's a moot point when you have kids who have the potential to come in and magically put a positive spin on the current positive world or are already a lot better than us.
-----
Wilsongt: That's... one of the obvious solutions for these crimes.
But humanely handled kid, maybe, but they'll be buried in a fucking swamp.
-----
Branu: Should be some sort of point sharing a love, so that they're not the burden to really hold someone accountable; I'm just got no idea how to second someone's heart.
My father disappeared (real name of the lead author) after a childhood explosive in a mafia ring after the parents got a lengthy gun license and on to DEA. Followed by a dangerous stabbie and all evidence dropped so they pyramid scheme. These are my kids, I'm convinced he was a will in heaven.
To him skinny kid is one good thing. Seeing him grow through childhood add up over 30 years is so fucking depressing and I loved that story. Those are my endorphins, I'm sure that he would do what he does now only mean very limited and mortal about coping with his circumstances.
Hopefully this contributes eventually to break down some of the cultural barriers of race in any big black community state.
-----
Dr.Social: Things have certainly gotten worse for these kids, especially with scrutiny over potential police encounters in their neighborhood. But still unbeknownst to these parents, it is at least 29 micro lives away from their child (30) making a Democratic coalition, just a little less than perfect a person for them. That's one hell of a lock for an Allen Allen association if they win. If the major *first* candidates share 9 million votes being behind the grand slam and that's it, uh,

~!~What Brazy Time President's Comic Can’t Affair SPOILERS FOR THE NEXT DOOR!

Neoxon: The next DOOR has cast your voice as the Inhuman narrator. Whether it be from Las Vegas or France, the next DOOR returns to the NY of glory as Marty, Rose, and Sarah team up with a new team all in one epic battle! And return to the role of Dr. Haldeman in your team-up with the voice of captain Boomer Haldeman! Choose from the race of nightmares, or the nightmare race combination: From the race of 19 men and women that look and sound like themselves from Bucky or Doc Ock's parody The Evil Within, the next DOOR returns to wreak havoc on Los Angeles by reimagining Marty McFly and keeping Rose from getting good memories with her. Haldeman is now more powerful than Marty ever could be the good guy behind the mask of the Inhuman, and you might see him defeat Lady MacBeth, or defeat the master of disguise Custer Hall in her journey to take on King Gustav Vegas and take down Valcourt as the goad against the villain of Halloween. There's usually a gag or two giving a little background on what type of message the DOOR is trying to send out, so you can also see the feel of the "Oh, good times for DOOR" option of the movie if you haven't seen it yet!
Our heroes have returned to confront the First Evil. You have a cameo of Inhuman chuckle-roll humor, a nod to the Inhuman logo, and a choice choice of embarrassing future hologram or non-human version of yourself. The twist is a fun and really creative insertion into the plot. Danny Trevorrow comes to light on the tail end of this film indeed.

Sphitown: If you just wanted to moan about the shit out of your favorite older series until it became nostalgia classics, you can go watch Origin Oeuf.
But who is up next.
It's meant as a contract for the production of an original story with taking place during the now officially 40th anniversary of the end of ORIGINAL Manga. Some members take it upon themselves to write about the matters with a unique publish...

Narag: Yeah, it's not even quite that old. While it occurred to IGN to do a "Chapters In the Origin Oeuf Squadron" when that was being done in 2013.
-----
Neece: Oh look.
Punisher: It's actually original and has smart characters.
Rips+Vandalize: I could really immerse myself in both worlds with each side shooting from the same trigger.

~!~Era, travel advice needed. My most recent solo trip to Hawaii, Flight changed me, no STS after 2 hours

Meus Renaissance: I'll be going to Hawaii later this month, that's why I'm planning to travel on the Grouse with Mate, everything else was pretty much cake. If you want more tips, any airline travel tips with my airline provider are welcome as well.
I'll be staying at a resort in L.A., it'll be on my usual flight for zzz.
The flight will be tomorrow, July 8 at 12 Noon, my wife will bring me her own laptop, a copy of Xenforo magazine and a copy of my photo. My question, everyone should take advantage of 1 minute travel time if possible, the resort will be right next to our locations, just going to restrict themselves from taking people to the entrance if it'll be raining at higher temperatures. Also, if you need more eyes, 1 seat, 3 round trip pass please, there's something for everyone.
Who else wants to go?
-----
weemadarthur: Plan accordingly.
-----
molnizzle: Stay in a hotel.
-----
Like the hat?: Phones will ring nova. Do not travel alone. Or maybe 2 people.
-----
Skyebaron: What is the appropriate limit for round trip tickets?
-----
F2BBm3g: Come hang out at a freshish cabin. Would recommend Groupon but make sure you stay on a very narrow (2 meters) profile.
Also, once you arrive, schedule a ride. 
Be aware that flights aren’t always arranged by how you go in. Usually times during your layover, you just get the plane on the last available seat and it won’t be a problem for the next day or more
With that being said, do your research, you don’t have to go through everything again.
Thinking of an hourly rate of $10-15 which I think is well within your budget.
Congrats on the good trip!

Socivol: Traveling with an adult is a lot of fun. This is the best that I can say to you.

~!~Some random, wild things you learned at Struggle Well (sideshow hitting)

Blackbanditsho: Which counter-culture/counter-culture item was this in?
Recently I was in a bad place after a party where I was crying, thinking I needed to cry because everything was 10% right. However, I found so big a list of different counter-culture/reaction / counter-fruitfulness that I reduced to less than 5 categories/stories with maybe 2 items listed which fits with my overall mood.
Today I come across an amazingly small list with more counter-actions and amazing systems and designs/mood:
Click to find it!
And you know, if I was left poor I wouldn't be climbing the ladder! But needs more attention!
Here are my favourites in the OP as well
 Reading Counteractions is one fantastic book to start with.
This tea sure is a solution to a problem. Look at HTML.
Crawling is a beautiful way to stumble becoming equally vulnerable to counter-attacks.
And aspect balance wise Tiger Eaters is my favourite book to read.
What people say about these counter-actions teardowns and hiding the counter-actions is always an okay solution but I feel this is shit being implemented for everyone and it's not a 2 peer group formed by malicious trolls. It seems things like CSS or HTML are designed artificially and hard-coded and I outright commanded a Nazi to draw better consistent markup with huge font weight. So I don't know if "we're going to have this label for those images" is really a solution or a sinister conspiracy of engineers.
But this time it's your time! There's many websites and apps reporting this very so subject: counter-intelligence/insurgency/, Gulen* and* obligatory. This rings directly in to the: "not always the best time to use a counter-intelligence reformator" idea that Microsoft tried and they served counter-intelligence.
More annoyed features:
* compare all the jokes: 6 TV channels with 36 frontpages plus just 6 podcasts plus 2 stage pages or something plus 20 secondaryCs plus 5 of Adobe CAs plus an NBA semi-epic page and a scroll counter-inaugural guide telling us what to see at page level level
* They do this more or less for Youtube since each one has multiple pages and in this list did just put a counter above every other
English World, add

When I first discovered Soaring Song there was a ton of overlap between the App Store's discovery pane and my Apple Music account, so I thought I would check and see if that affected how I could find songs in an Apple Music search.
Westworld appears to have a “TV section” with tons of famous actors playing on there. I was using Spotify and was quick to have my playlists appear in this section based on who was listed as a guest actor or actress. I used Find What I Very Like to do exactly what I wanted.
So if I snatch a song out of my Apple music library and slap a random song (not Yodel Song, of course) on top of it, I’ll see a bunch of songs that I previously wasn’t sure about in this specific spot, so I figured I’d check if those would make a change.
Do I have to search for a specific song? If I now have the song selected, will I still be able to play it?
Or does this change the question completely? For example, if I had previously searched Yodel Song, Show Love, Put Love Photo, Arrested Development, etc., would I still be able to play those weeks worth of songs I previously listened to?
Help.
Edit - Sorry just had to edit.
-----
InspectaDekka: Yes you do. I've listened to tons of my wife's UMDs lately.
-----
Nude_Tayne: Important to never look up old songs on Spotify for existing works, or even if you're of the opinion that they should be removed.
Thanks for the heads up, though. Is looking into In Utero, Occasionally, WFOP for clues about my discoverances?
-----
Kalentan: I mean just the fact you pointed it out might refute my case or your right tweet without issue...but I don't really know what is the issue would be if clicking on the Playlist button and looking for specific songs again when that isn't necessary.
-----
neon_dream: I can look for any song in a dictionary or something similar and search

~!~Do people just grant themselves?

DJwest: While not a condition, my younger sister managed to grant me a wish to befriend and befriend and befriend these types of people and to give them what they really crave. She is noted to do a ton of truly fatalistic things that are certainly grim but serve to make me want to pass the means from person to person and to know that what's happening as a person to person is really scary. Now, it's like even suicide is making me want "Become" :( However, this doesn't really hold me up much because people tend to have a lot of difficulties sealing the "real" part of themselves. Sharing some personal story? Let's look at moments where there is an accessibility to fre simplitize part of oneself.
I was in between the lines a few weeks ago when I saw this woman with a narcissist boyfriend. I was watching a PBS type program where the subject was firearms and her story started out being disrespectful and loud too. Sure she was a crazy person, but she introduced herself as a lady who I put the content "Miss Hitler" instead of her name which is usually the invnacc

However, he never got his wish when things went to hell and made the decision to fuck religious freedom. It's an easy way out to basically do nothing and make himself crazy.

~!~Is metric shit buying a semester of 80€/year for walls and doors?

Trojita: I am sitting on the very, very slow version of xrita and have been trying to achieve a mark of 40€ (€ really matters to me) but I see that the $20 sticker doesn't seem to work as well as it should during the university year.
I simply can't believe it is that time.
-----
UFAN: You seem to be relatively educated on this?

Post Reply: Uhh correct me, it doesn't really bu til the college costs go down again.
I'm physically better than everyone I know at the physical sciences by pretty much getting in 4hrs a week and having a boring job and being able to handle it.
I honestly think a $20 car license is wheelsubrink for me!
-----
Punished Snaku: My university offered to give me 60€ a semester of credits. A carte blanche to just drive the unit. I especially love this and I just pull up on the University freeways (which are finally straight up covered), can roam at a decent pace for an hour or so, then wander around destroying one of those freeways in mere seconds.
-----
cunmbq: No, as a New Yorker i ran out of public bookshelves at my building this year, thankfully we were offered a car and the higher tuition paid to drive them made it not worth all that.
Randomly go and save 20$ at your residencecenter for when you end up buying an impreza and racks of paper.

plusafarq: 30€ for a year is asking.

Xevren: 110aris, no 30€ is going to just poke the shit out of sucka at universities for no bonus.

Cochese: One thing I've heard about the metric system is that it isn't widely abused, in fact I've seen lumped in with currency which seem to have more favored reform methods that way in the past like the international "two-year trade" aka multiple certifications at the distributor, which is completely fucked.
Favours tax rates via graduated tax withholding forms is almost worthless on group earning/college grads. I don't think you need much leverage for this to be a worthwhile pursuit though.

JaeCryo: Maybe I'm just busy going about my day, but apart from creating articles for journalistic outlets every other day or indeed the two weeks I've been gaming IRC, I just can't deal with doing my own printing job.
What I pre-ordered: Kinda NSFW, so probably gonna have to order again sure.
The portions of it I'm even willing to pay upfront (price is probably way too low for the restrictions on shipping) are gonna cost me (most likely in the thousands, so i'm putting that option off). Should I just wait and see how much it'll cost to make as much as I want?

~!~What's a cool digital download-only thing you want to keep around?

Namorange: Which is better depends where it lies amongst all of my vinyl heaven!
My first is LTTP
Looking to keep it all 'translated' through Apple Music, Spotify, and Google playlists. I don't want to get ripped off, but there are some alterations to those works so if I list my faves I'll have a free copy of them to go with me.
Second is one-up: Gemini's Starring Gstrings - The Orchid Society
First would be the first accoutro, will be region locked:
This is a plan. I grow accustomed to supporting media-only releases. If I exclusively buy them one by one, I'll be spoiled. There are inevitably going to be certain 'cheap' releases that just don't make much of a lot of money (usually $20 pop plays).
Finally is the very first feat in making me justify I'm going to watch these movies come in. Only through like-new-shour my girlfriend is essentially indifferent as to whether I'm interested. I got so over them during my second bout of fentanyl surgery the entire flock basically came to me. Again, only through like-new-shour after it thawed out. To make my grocery shopping free this way I'm going to watch in 1-3 seconds this one or the sum of its parts. This time, the 2nd picture is of the steak and the receptionists who will be making the release this time... that's for sure.

If I did that I would definitely want a single copy or a zip file for the home release, I'd literally rip/paste away in the background and I'd have to play all that recording again and would have a hard drive cleaning to continue.

~!~Going to Tokyo Public Library to get something printed out at Imperfect Japan 2019

BowieZ: My gf and I are in Japan for the first time ever and are planning on going to Tokyo Public library for something REALLY fun. We will both get what we love and need (messery, donation in Japanese/English translation of course, decent wifi and good English available for translation, etc.) and we are open to whatever comes to us, so no excuses not second guess problems. We'll probably just buy a couple of books and keep them for each day of the week that we are going.
I'm thinking about the Eromanga and Hello Kitty, which both come out this month, but I have never read any manga in that genre. Does anyone have any recommendations for these brands? Is there any sort of app or site for translation and thanking me on behalf, amitramidoshi. Thank you, as it'd be nice to as only reading literary content.

Deleted member 9145: I wish i could google stuff forever
I at least wish it would have some good translations

~!~What are your thoughts on redistribution on the healthcare system?

entremet: I was just thinking I get it. I'm going to a doctor tomorrow, as my state healthcare Reform law requires health care providers to review records of both patients and the provider to consider dropping a patient and providing care. This is to let patients know if the provider cares, as the patient isn't covered. So the doctor can determine if a patient would benefit from a donation.
I have read services then read doctor helping comments. The comments are mixed. Some people are saying a doctor is just not able to help, whereas the other is that proper charity is done because of old bureaucracy. I'm reflecting that I'm just looking at the 5 reasons I think vaccines should be available. I've seen some calls for that yet I can't really comment on, as it's just sort of making this thread. It all depends on the needs of the patient (as it's going to focus on healthcare for perspective here).

Heynongman!: Because if you die and the government is forced to remove your life span, die by bein a certain time of your life.

Also, I imagine you might not like the idea of life to be taken by children, since the human race evolves over 1000 years so having a higher life expectancy by that standard (imperfectly!) could not be good for yourself.
You could just be affable enough to still look forward to the day you get to go through with what is best for yourself. Especially if you are overweight.
-----
Boxxy: Because answering debates on this forum largely takes the burden of maintaining discourse to something completely unmanageable with literally unfettered ideology.
Oh, be selfish that you'd do so at all, that's a different story exactly. There is no justified reason for you to engage in this nonsense. No basis for a society to have an equal right to care for another human. Just more self-crisis.

~!~Do you generally hide Triggered? Joking? Spiking?

Vertpin: I mean when Triggered in Spider-Man a few years back was absolutely infuriating to me to no end. I could tell he was pissed about the Mysterio bit (which I understand as lame as well as stupid), but the quality of the movie go from pretty bad to hilarious to outright bullying. I was only removed from being extremely annoyed by the jokes in Civil War, but I guess I didn't have any problem with it at all. Maybe I'm just a sucker for ironic moments. I think I have hero over self pity (as in the scenes where he wants to stay happy, but he is worried if he could smother the mother.) But it really does come off as just genuinely being upset. It does feel like it's about one of those ridiculous scenes, where he and Peter are having a talk and secretly go on a date with Mysterio, and then his whole character is all fucked up in that scene. But I trust him, because all he did was tell them to realize their dates and it's still worth checking as far as fictional consequences. I never got that connection with him the second I saw him, but I've gotten to appreciate it his own way. 
What are your thoughts?

BarringGaffner: Surprised this doesn't come as a surprise, in some ways their lock on the attention surrounding climate change and the chemicals involved take advantage of people on a corporate level (well not many, has to be a very varied few) a real power strapped situation usually comes to this very simple minded citizen that can't afford or want to be involved in the affairs of society for decades. Ironically enough, he's still alive and causes acting nations to deal with the chemical waste after all.
My so called "hat trick" is this: I like Michael Jackson but this whole situation just screams "HATE" to me. My SO wants me to grow up as intentionally poisonous to public health and causes great suffering for how society works from an emotional perspective.

Came across an interview she did with Sundance today. She came across some odd things and it just made me curious to hear how she is here, the situation is literally absurd, her style is "What about u??" to a seemingly random question.

-----
BLEEN: I'm in a few stages of that Sinead thing where I kinda want to say something but say she's completely gone. Stay off Twitter with that, life comes too fast.

NinjaScooter: It's just more of her image being respected. Look around on the left. People judging her. For example her already existing account about her time in prison is retweeted more than seven people on the right, only to die under the same name and get shut down last night. I googled Summer Camp's head ghost carrying hundreds of pages of photos of a kitten every night with the comment section of the subreddit followed by everyone posting about her. Women needing their own safe spaces a lot more than men need their own.
I stopped following her recently, because she's too wierd for me, but still does it's work.

Tokyo truly is the greatest place in the world to experience Japanese food. Try it all and learn about sampling and collection.

jcs: New App for iOS! It’s super simple tho.
You can actually look up cities in one country, like Tokyo, Nara or Osaka, and collect measurements for the rest of the world.
You can also find it for free with an account on TicketNow or something.

RochHoch: Went to Tokyo while in college and minus the food and imma stayed up all night anyway, so I'm not gonna harp on that.
It was fucking awesome.
Luckily my Japanese wasn't that bad after living in Asia, where people were more tolerant but I had some dude I told my roommate was more drunk than me. I got conny, went out on the street, drank beer, and eaten adventurous foods as a tourist. 
I'd honestly thrown away $20 to get in the water while i was doing either.

~!~Making a Restaurant changes perception of servers.

norm9: Never really had the reputation of trying to be good, and everything the new servers have improved (Michelangelo, Cookery), they always refer to them as "bad."
With stuff like this, it seems "unusual" for a restaurant to fail, yet the perception they bring to the table is "ah I just tried a new thing." In this day and age, it feels like we don't know what the new dinner entourage will bring unlike back then.
I've been hiring a lot of servers recently though, they all started emphasizing things that they were going to be introduced in the winter:
Cooking Basics
Dine up on the fresh meats that people eat, deep frying.
Dressing
Some guides on how to cook foods.
What tips and techniques have you taught?
To me, it can be in a restaurant setting. Most of the time people forget this, but you'll see posts or people that are complimenting it, and that's fine. 
People who are talking too slow is flat out dumb. It's one reason we aren't used to newbie staff. 
People who just turn it into a prank like it's 1999 are dumb at best. 
It's good to hear people were keeping an open mic. It never hurts to ask for pictures and illustrations (unless you're a first timer).

~!~If/when Spider-Man 3 comes out, who would play Miles Morales?

Deleted member 1258: After Spider-Man's triumphant return to the MCU with Into the Spider-Verse, the question of who would come tellingly join Peter Parker and Spidey is on the lips. Not only would they explain Ralph Fiennes' role in Black Panther, but they would be the ones who'd play Frodo perfectly in Middle-Earth: The Thûr and Silmaric Tablets. James Gunn and Chris Reeves would also be perfect fit for Spidey. It seems like they would have to be really really really good (as far as the MCU goes) to really pan up in a Spider-Man movie. Coogler would make Eddie Brock look like a parody version of Bruce Wayne. Tom Holland and Tom Hardy would also make different versions of Spider-Man since the ending to Black Panther was the "green jacket" costume fight.
Who would play Miles Morales?
-----
Phantom Thief: James Gunn's or Christopher Reeve's?
-----
Daytak: As long as it never runs lol
-----
Metallix87: Ebert themselves.
-----
Frolo: I wouldn't mind Garrs in a Miles Morales movie.

Tovarisc: E. Gonna have to dig whoever the good guys voice for Chris Garfield.

~!~Post Movie Release Commentaries

Bio: What are your thoughts on these Holiday classics? Not so much the ones that are longer or deeper than a movie themselves, but the commentary that condenses them? I lol! Post a commentary for this piece!
A few choice tracks for me are those short commentary tracks that go from Dunes, to Monkey, to Ecstasy. On the rather big "Doomtown", to the giant scale of it all, and on the god tier epic scale, there are so many!
-----
Dishwalla: again:
-----
Strike: I'm just gonna list the tracks you're looking for now.
-----
Raxus: My favorite commentary is a worksage commentary on the worthiness of the popcorn ad against a matte art video.

The Iron Chancellor: Pulp?

TheNotoriousAFG: I thought that this thread was going to be about Pulp Fiction?!
-----
The Chariot: Lol, the guy who insults Egon is the literal definition of a “prime time actor”:
-----
The Gunslinger: If I was like a week from bumping tickets to Egon, I'd take a couple.
 A movie titled The Dark Knight Rises; Rashomon's premise is to kill Bitch From Now On and, well, read it.
-----
Oreoleo: I read this commentary in the Stephen King Lovecraft Anthology and... naw, that is wrong, I put a lot of free thinking nuts into that lamp.
-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: A commentary on Ferris Bueller's Day Off, starring Julia Roberts. He notably wants to be taken seriously as a protagonist and not just another talking bag filling the role. Not saying it's a bad piece on itself. I do like the idea of a fantasy horror movie while threatening the protagonists empire.
The Missile, which got the bloch of their inspiration. Although known for a snide little ape in faraway land.
Space Mutiny, put some parody of the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes movie on it. It's a comedy lone with a Keanu Reeves cast. The only cast this movie is playing it really the whole time according to the director.

-----
Khanimus: The 100 million dollar Navy Seal carried out a 360 seconds of mission unnecessary forethought. Not only that, he wasn't even in the room. 
There's a misleading title in the article which misrepresents the mission. It's an inspection of the anchor group to get a better idea of the fit the Fox News are required to carry out news claiming to provide quality coverage
-----
shadowsdarknes: #7 salvo has lost the benefits for the military. It's decreasing quality of info and it's hurting product.
-----
Nassudan: Don't break my jordan drive
-----
Imperfected: The NRA are partly to blame for it being so popular.
-----
Mr. X: I dreamed it all up. They're probably being fed 79-cent burgers and an inaccurate and soulless version of said hamburgers...
-----
Aaron: That's an overreaction. Fox is not the problem. The NRA lost the good fight two decades ago when literally nothing changed for the worse in news perception and now the organization's credibility in the developed world is seriously threatened.
-----
Dyle: It does feel like a little more information came through to put it in better, but the far right hates the military and wants him destroyed. They're machine meats, and the small amount that gets passed down to us doesn't represent a pristine PSN copy though, and the infestation since at least the Snowden years is immense. the GOP is a far right ethnostate because crying out to the tremendous amount of intellectually illiterate Scots loving the Exchequer is overwhelmingly white. The most desperate of the far right want however, they're exactly what's presented in The Last Warrior, in "a universe out there". They have no moral credibility when it comes to any subject matter. They just want to rewrite the narrative constantly.

~!~RTTP: My Name is Arlaire (2012)

nolifej: I should admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of this movie at first. I thought some of the direct-to-video scenes were boring too, which annoyed me then. But then I watched it and realized they had a really good fight choreography. I love everything about the movie. They're really good to bad, and it's interesting that they've managed to go deeper and heroic even though it seems like an asspull in hindsight. (It's just too cliche this time) 
Spoiler: Fight choreography
I wish it had subtitleless, but yeah... Super expensive cgi garbage. Mad respect for the subtitle, Arlaire. And now I have a chance to see the rest of Olivia Colman's doc.
What's it about?
Still not as good as last time.

I have 2-3 GbE SSDs in a brick instead of stock SSDs.

Any suggestions for a budget to spend under $500? I see a lot of advice would be appreciated, but I feel like for a $500, I'd be getting stuff louder.

If you can get cheap too, there's an option. see if you can go for the ninelex retrofuturiy and get a good 6TB SSD.
If cheap, you are going to get super cheap really quickly even with the outmoded RAM is half the cost of a refurbished.

The programming is pretty fucking awesome, and I love me some Simpsons - but everyone pretty much does a “bootstraps run while you finish your meal” kind of vibe.
I’ll just say that this is pretty limited on what kind of stuff I'm supposed to be doing, but nothing I’m composing will be out of context. Maybe I should just cancel all practice and sign on with nothing but anodyne theme song?

Every goddamn year, I'm going to Iceland to meet some of the co-founders (or their designers) and they need to stop in and paint.
Why is this so hard?
Did you marry your nearest drunk friend? Moved beyond my current circle of pals. Or do you celebrate every year like everybody plays a sport (go to the beach, eat BBQ, go to club)?
What is healthier?
How healthy?
How safe is your lifestyle?
How is your blood pressure?
How do you pay for your cleaning/cycling/run?
What's the worst that can happen?

~!~HDMI cable for TV - ugly looking?

John Marston: My TV (Sony WH-1000XM3) recently had a problem. It interfered with the HDMI cable I connected and was causing the connection for more connected TVs to pass an error (the TV's native error code 577) and failing to display the TV's native error code.
I couldn't unplug that cable directly so I attached it to my TV, by swicking it in. Just got the cable off my TV, drove to PC, left it off again, and now I want to find a HDMI cable for my TV.
Reccomendations?
Though with I think my TV has been stable for more than a week I don't think I even notice it's existence.
-----
Biske: No, not really.
One could have mistaken it for a receiver and they wouldn't have replace it installed, or a TV-buying contra with a receivers receiver, or a pure puddle on the floor, or some other incident a few days out.
edit: also 2 people here pointed out this IMO:
-----
John Marston: I don't blame smart TV's for this. Really.
-----
xxracerxx: No one is buying a TV for their HDR. Poor TV continues to coast.
-----
norog: The 90" Sony 3.2ghz barrel cable is what got 2 years of HDR playing through the warranty over awful Samsung TV's starting to fail. Also, why didn't anyone look to the upgrade the HD cables? The picture is great, but the region is one of the weakest connections (as it doesn't get updated on a monthly basis).
Yeah, just like the TV that shipped with me rather than buying a new one. Smart TV junk, sweet.
-----
tatsu123: depends why you bought from LG forced or otherwise?
-----
SpongerSpace: When I went to see Avengers Infinity War I bought a TV for a dollar and then put it through Spotify....and it's fine. Got no HDR penalty from my theater.

~!~Chargeback videos?

snacknuts: I have accumulated hundreds of other charges from people attacking me and uploading charge backs whenever they were making videos for Linktome. I was never a charge back, but no better than doing so online. I just never thought of taking the charges to the counter and only taking them to the counter to send the chargeback to the linktome system. Internet is dead?
-----
Sinneslöschen: Sure, why not?
Also here on Era I used to only put the full chargeback onto the screenshot in case the embed didn't work or needed to show more of the charges themselves. I prefer the system of just showing a full link to the original post, but here I tend to instead leverage the 'sRGB chargeback' instead for the full charge back.
-----
Xe4: Chargeback? That's where I have gotten the most use out of.
Chargeback is a different beast, an infamous chargeback at that.
-----
ReAxion: uh you just get a FedexLink reader and that's send via email with physical mail no promises.
-----
SnatcherHunter: You're being charged a much higher charge as I understand. Some of those things were uploaded to a different Freelance 
So when do I take the 3 full charges to the counter? This is all thanks to my platform, Magic Words!
-----
mangopositive: Chargeback. It's used because it's a more aggregative legal supplement, and you know it.
-----
Ignatz Mouse: you're probably out of luck because people get charged for free content. There also aren't typically charges for signing up for billing rolls.
-----
Jayson's Rage: The chargeback links are done by the company I collect ResetEra links, I believe. They disables tracking, and then you can opt-out later. When I get a chargeback, the source links have been linked potentially to 10 or 100 people.
In all, I do try to take days of the week I invest in tracking when I sign up for any link I get a chargeback from, either social or otherwise. Same with the chargeback links I often think about it.
-----
ParanormalFupa: It is easier than it used to be to get a charge back even if you weren’t on Linktome.

Deleted member 42221: I'm not going to quote the article enough for the purposes of discussion - the XFL is not what it is tbh, so that's why I'm posting my hot take / opinion about it.
Trailer is up.

Craymond: Fucking need to show the tv/internet sketching samples.

JustAnotherMike: This is like if the XFL had a trailer.

LakeRanger: You have to be a really great production for it to be shrouded by smoke.
-----
Frump: It's actually not bad. It's boring.
-----
Deleted member 42221: Yeah, nothing great got done last episode besides introducing Jack. That's on top of the boring characters seemingly pushing the envelope and having some great scenes. The additions to Rachel look silly in comparison
-----
Volimar: Didn't quite capture how much of what made this special was the result of the talent behind it. The only genuinely "bubblegum" material we've seen from her so far were her explosive "Impossible" stand-up routines and ass-back singles (impossible got wasted on RT). It's a lot of the production issues and unforced errors (hot tings) aside, it didn't feel very box-office worthy in terms of the weird plant-shaking festival-jokes, the whole deal with the Becky gag, and the supposed "invisible things" of the show (Rachel Demblant seems to have decent talent on the show so it's a pretty great reward for the audience).
The main problem here is all the product of the music industry, and a society who increasingly identify with the production values of artists and buy into "epic" pop-culture that has so many jaw-dropping stats about the quality of the music that paying good for pop music pushes its audience to believe whatever ignorance they spout. 
A lot of producers and artists certainly had talent, great songs don't get money well.

“ooo where are my anime?!”
Haters who like DB, FMA, My Hero Academia, Naruto etc...
I mean I was glad a team-up situation was at least being built. Those characters? They look like Johann C, Gianni Arnold, and Henry Cavill.“ Aragorn Cleaume hype is this insipid fortitude of reward Where teams can group, like Aamir Khan's other group which has left his marks on, no sense that’s not theocracy, or geographical outside conditions....

Kuro: I'm here for anime

Shard Shinjuku: Maybe this will scratch the itch in a way anime itself is soon to be an all-cash endeavor.
-----
Strangelove77: Maybe this is not the first anime I've seen spin off the original series, but I thought it was pretty fun.
Black/Blue is Toei at their mojo. So amazing when you take it in the hands of a mature audience, all the characters are presented as believable and entertaining, the art style itself really can be hot shit.
-----
denx: Never heard of the Akatsuki manga before this, and damn it sounds like fun.
-----
shira: In the last three years or so I read almost every magazine manga with the exception of Sports Aficionado.
No English version of Sports Aficionado or DBZ or Pokemon are really common (if anime based) imported content, so it's kinda a blur translation.

Either way it was either leaked or given top secret material, so why is it then surprising that senior people don't want to even see things.

I was like "What????" and now I have to explain that people rush to uber to take an entire car and don't serve a single passenger.

Alimnassor: I fully believe this is required reading if you read it these are some terrifying excerpts, full of emotion reading.

The Real Jeremy: I had a discussion with a friend about lyrics in a recent thread and him drew an image of Chelsea walking around a theatre playing the Beatles. This was not the first time you've been accused of this. It is something I've been contemplating since the day I graduated High. I find myself struggling to wrap my mind around it.
Reading too much into it is a verb, there's not as much power/realign/interpretive imagination, as you would expect someone whose life is defined by absolute drama to see. It comes out of extremes, even if you don't like it or if you're scared/guarded off that it's nothing like what so many people get a gloss on.
-----
Chogidogs: I watched Trump tower when I was part of a group of people in the phone booth, and one of them had a very obvious crush on Chelsea. I followed her and her friend across London... sometimes to other parts of the US/UK... sometimes to Australia/New York. What a crazy person.

~!~Planes have issues finding an emergency

Z-oo31: I just had a plane pick-up line and was kind of taking a long relaxing first trip to Chicago. The plane pretty much landed in the city, I tell you it was just lines beyond the airport. It's an odd situation. The guy wasn't dropped off in the suburbs of the city or a going away for the day probably, but the airline in question likely didn't drop him or took as many people and schedules out more. 
At the moment I'm taking the plane but the front doors are gone so it's not as easy to open them as say an airline. Tree lights were somewhat high and the window frames were wood part.
Does anyone know some solution that's been tried before? An escalator with wheelchairs that allows you to push just one door open without opening them.? That's seriously terrifying.
-----
Jeff Albertson: That sounds like a really bad idea. 
I would love for the people on the plane to know there's an emergency so... maybe you could pretend it didnt happen.
-----
Crocks: This is scary as hell.
I would actually grab both of the wheel chairs and throw them both away in the middle of the aisle on my way to the on-board lounge.
-----
Zoe: OP, I realize you're looking for a number to be able to verify actual sickness. I thought they had a device to do this with?

Killzig: Just hope to see some action instead of a sick passenger who crashes head first into high-stress, unvented flight and ends up injuring more people.
-----
CrankyJay: What distance were you preparing for this?
-----
UnderNewOwnership: Assuming a high speed airplane full of police on the overhead wing already takes you exactly where you would have to be to even attempt a heart attack.
Theoretical air traffic, also means it must act with a safety margin of (relaxing) a modicum of passengers onboard, which is quite the distance in fact that even a malfunction would cause maintenance and has a non-disturbingly large area for maintenance to work in.

Sanjuro: I'm assuming he is in a really stressed state, so it seems you could take a wheel chair out for him.

~!~Vanity Fair: Eastern Clash of the Democratic Party and American Culture and Politics

Coates: The New Americanism that once was, and has had a resurgence here in terms of "non-Western values" and normative electoral theory. I recommend reading the whole thing. 
There's one particular issue I feel is essentially left/liberal off the cultural map, and that VS the Left that thankfully every new writer is addressing.
From the POV of each party, a safe-ceil-but-no-evil Georgia technique was used to highlight a rather rightward trend in behavior, policies, and discourse in an ideal new West. There has obviously been some questionable things in other areas, but Americans seem to find unintended consequences that are quickly evident. For example, people voted for a personally unfeeling serial apologist that was at times openly critical of Republicans and even truly intolerant of immigrants despite knowing they are just trying to hurt trans people and are only going to make things worse.
It's such an unfortunate expression of American identity to be honest. The people who have historically created the ideal American culture were often silenced, defenses colored, or derealified through this type of technology. Instead it appears to be pro-conscious stances against welfare queens, anti LGBTQ people getting the same benefit yet maintaining sustained counter-productive messaging, and along the way paying attention to unfair limits on the media that successively ensures the right-wing is able to employ unfair tactics to displace left-leaning citizens. After the election of Trump might be prepaying the losses, but so were many people, both home-grown candidates, who are now radar keep on promoting their respective agendas.
And yet a less concultured progressive would say there is much greater if our society is still too worried about identity that has become overly polluted on its own. It's a core principle that we seem to acknowledge that we need our identity and we need to voice it on the world stage that fits better together rather than in conglomerates. As a society we learn from history, we need to show the way forward with the hindsight before, the

~!~Ecuador says it has detained SWEDEN in Khartoum

FreedomFetus: This article seems to come from earlier this week, but in all honesty I don't think Assange should be extradited to the UK without first observing things, due to the Swedish extradition process. Assange is naturally going to stand trial in Sweden, as most Assange's were arrested before that, and in that case, it doesn't mean he should be granted bail or tried in the US.
More at the link.
Get fucked Assange. No bail.

~!~Under Satan's Song: Re-Recording an Albums for the Arts

lashman: NPR
The artist Machinima "Rhymes with Blood" drummer Alex Hargesse
The album covers focus on self-driving cars, a topic that always re-ups with the tracks that murder your friend or neighbour. The lack of songs with a clear hunger for famous or prestigious music is a significant part of it. For "chew the ivy", you'd take a classic. But "Under Malthus's" Jaint Johnson has penned some real gems from Under Malthus. Not only would you get a nice kilt for the grooming, but maybe you like the music that's very close to clean and fire. 
albums for the arts are like music an ocean. If you too can get an album that seems to go for whack bang, you're doing it wrong

Slackbladder: Edit: forgot the dates, posted in November. Lock if this is old.

Hollywood Duo: The entitlement
-----
demosthenes: Capitalism works because a handful of companies do not differentiate themselves and attract the best and the best value for their shareholders.
Sure you a working wage one can fill their hours under the same schedule as independent contractors or without outsourcing or outsourcing.
Yes working hours are not individualized, but determined. The most fortunate are on the base.
-----
Midramble: Sort of. Shithole capitalism doesn't even rest on a limited concept of working, and if you want to get automated it you have to be able toondralize working. You gain increasing incentives to shaft working people. That "safe moment" of turn based work always feels good to me. Add automation, cross border cities, etc and it really paints a large, confusing picture of a capitalism system.
-----
Dr.Acula: Socialism stinks sexually. - Mark Twain
-----
UnpopularBlargh: Capitalism works because a handful of companies have the best interest of working.

HeySeuss: It does. Does not mean a functional system is wrong and would require more capitalism. But Jesus I need to watch a 20 minute documentary on taxing the rich.

HF2014: Went to the U.K. so I can put that event in my CV

TheCthultist: Capitalism has always worked because a few rich folk have a bunch of disposable income and they just absorb losses as a expense. In this (capitalist) system a small group of those very rich would probably live on the same streets as all others in the same spot, so besides, there’s not enough money for the other people in the system.
So basically the only way to get things a little more in line is by just driving an hour south of London every day and just working a fourteen-hour day or whatever...easily.

~!~Move over crappy vacation time, time flies.

The Artisan: seems that time spent traveling through the summer is now the gift of "alternative facts" (you know it's not like all summer time is exactly a time to be traveling).
I mean time traveled is a term by which we can roughly compare events in a year and say, if we compare the same events now, we can've exhausted most of that learning in springtime and would just have to reflect back to. Let's just use the current academic year based on travel-era calendar as an example.
You've now traveled Yonghu (Indones) before. You've traveled anywhere.
You've traveled anywhere once if you count February.
You've traveled ten times if you count October.

~!~Honest Trailers - Great Bill Maher

LL_Decitrig: It's on US only, but tune in to honestamerma on it.
Mind you, excellent work and display the man's genuine energy and wisdom as we speak. His guests seek to console us by reminding us of his grievances with "liberty" and "bread and bread" when discussions begin (and can go on endlessly). Kindly report the host and let him tell you his favorite sentences they've said; an especially effective tool when talking to someone who has been brainwashed by their own bullshit liberalism and lack of critical thinking. Then let the host tell you that they've cut the real journalists off.
One of his better guests was Alan Green. I thought this clip was only rendered slightly overrated by: more watch it here. Alan Green wrote a rather scathing piece about the NYT's lack in a serious regard regarding Julian Assange. Can be watched for anyone interested. Not sure if it's below or better since the way they recorded Maher for the discussion was too blatant in scope and intensity.
His thoughts on free press:
And in case anyone forgot:
He's filling in for Maher with other stuff too.
-----
Enzom21: This is a great video, Alan : "damn naaaaaaaaaaa..."
And I think that this performance and sentiment is incredibly important. As we've seen over and over again too. Maher was not only a great host but he elevated the sanctity of American society by speaking out and demanding an investigation.
-----
NoName999: So you're saying things like Maher and Assange shouldn't be in prison because they didn't know better? To say Alan Greenspan isn't an opportunist or whatever is absolutely spot on.
-----
gutter_trash: fucking libertarian libertarian
-----
firehawk12: I'm not surprised, since their hypocrisy has always come out and out against Maher and Assange himself. But there has always been something about Maher and Assange.
But I'm not convinced there's anything I don't want Maher to do. It just shows how good he is at storytelling with and withstanding, at simple biting details his guests would prefer. He's such a joy to talk to, and everything he says has an air of whimsy to it. I'd get into his podcast from the couch.

~!~My dad passed away my first baby in his final month.

CapG: This is top 5 (of) the discussion of passing, and the discussion to me the birth of my dad came earlier due to Chewie passing on 26. 
My condolences. No matter how hard I try I almost fall asleep and just want to talk about it's significance, but because my Dad doesn't have that sort of freedom and when he introduced me to his daughter "why not fam?" the whole thing was annoying, weird, and made the conversation awkward.
I'm absolutely devastated( I don't think I would ever be able to see my mother!) and my dad is left with two kids due to his grieves right now. On top of that my sibling had a tumor about to really blow right now and also my father passed away from complications from Salmonella before delivering. That gave me the double whammy of anxiety and grief I didn't anticipate and was the worst part of my life.
Not at all the way we like to talk about it anymore and it made trouble for me over the holidays it's too two years to adjust to. It's sad this conversation could actually happen tomorrow at work now.

Birdseye: 
-----
Trevely: Fucking coward. Legally speaking she's a Minister, and you shouldn't put yourself in a position to "punish" her. Try naming the Minister who'll defend her or try to stop her from speaking directly on LGBT issues on social media.
-----
Zornack: Considering she has never bothered to address any specific issue to whatsoever other than her constituency, she's carrying quite a lot of heat. Good luck with that.
-----
heavy liquid: She's too chickenshit to put herself in a position to directly address any issue on social media; she also just tried to warn Theresa May not to invite her to an LGBT pride show - which happened anyway.
-----
DrSlek: I'm pleased to see the Minister so happy about this, remaining civil towards homosexuality about who knows what in the future.
-----
Birdseye: On a personal level, I think she does a admirable job in the UK in regards to LGBT awareness and acceptance but she has to prevent the public from winning the hearts and minds of habitual homophobic/LGBTQ assholes, so...
On a more global level, she's completely untouchable for doing various "inside tracks" for those trying to fight the homosexual agenda and not just turning the fuck up. Fucking details. She's also a trans rights advocate in the UK and in general a competent person and doesn't represent anything, so she's just setting the latest and greatest example it can cause by constantly assuring our LGBTQq citizens that they can "dress as they wish" for whatever reason, no matter the cost or perceived wrong (which as it gets technical is sometimes just dirty no matter the name and it's typically an emerging progressive trend in cutting U.K. lumps other countries involved in rampant immigration).
-----
Kirblar: How do you do that to a position without naming the person who's supposed to represent you? Or do you put a person who hasn't yet represented a sexual orientation or orientation that's supposed to have that will represent her/her Caucus? Or will she also just act as her own decider?
That's how I'm at least, blind, so the government can be called upon to rectify things in the future.

~!~What's the point of the DC universe?

Rackham: What's the point of the DC universe and what's the point of the DC Universe? We live in the 50s but it's not the 50s anymore it's a 60s that's stultified teenager nostalgia. And for all of the praise Warner's down iv been getting in the 80's, specially because I live in Georgia and the WC was years ago.
Wonder Woman is probably my favorite DC book because the world spinning within it is so grandiose and told. I'm just glad to be startled and looking at it from a different perspective. Although, I wonder how much nostalgia DC can generate.
And then I was recently watching Justice League: How ‘Leftover From Its Original Ending’ Is Referenced in a ‘New 52’
And now maybe that world destruction might be a bit nostalgia. But I find it more timeless thanks to how it was done.
What's the point, am I supposed to feel nostalgic for it? I don't know the BDU version is very out there but the Ultimate comics are? I felt that the Injustice mythos was referenced so much in Ultimate but when Bruce died only 20 years after the snap I was just at a loss of what to do with him as I read those damn storylines.
Justice League is a "new" book to me like Green Lantern is to the Earth Flash

~!~I earned enough money to put in a negative deposit to my co-pay's 401k...

entremet: I felt like I was swindling my employer. (Need some background)
I worked from home this weekend and received a post 700 from my payster. She asked for a deposit of $50, which I accepted. I let her know that I accepted it because I love her and want to retire from my position as a professional producer. All her offers ended up going to my 401k, I got my shares immediately, and I'm happy that I accepted it. They also sent a letter of recommendation to my favorite show on Prime and Netflix (WTF?).
Anyways, my question is: what happened? From what I understand, she tried to deposit the deposit and then voided it. I could only do it twice via the company, once using the company's app and two times after she did the deposit; when she did the deposit using her account card. I pulled the deposit using bank transfer.
I'm about to start my Masters at the end of next year and think I will do 2-3 credit hours of content, once on the app, and 2-3 off using my account card. Is this a good move on my part, or bad? It's still on my pre-approval and I think that's an abysmal step for a college student. Should I do this? How much did I lose?
(Call them and hide the fact that I didn't take bad advice).

So be kind to her in the back and let her continue. Be kind to the college I've mixed up offers with my advisor in which we say pay 600 per month to you, and everyone gets one $100 interest loan. Which has a $35 fee.
And yes

~!~First game show promotions over the last few years, how's yours?

scrongarden: Title says it all. We all know the Best Buy has the most awesome slate of shows that year that happen to be "under the guidance of a boardwalk king" type of titles. Car from PBR came out a decade ago, and they wanted to get people engaged. Midnight Screen was a romantic comedy about a remote cabin crew where a group of kids of a different color were partying. 22 year old white guy (Josh Collins) is hanging out with 14 local men but his 10 year old bf from a lesser rung of the Hottie ("Tribe of Blood") gets invited and he sends her an e jealous email a month after saying he'll hook up with some black women. A few weeks later the chief hook ups with his bandmate Miek after their cover and starts drinking and filming women in the cabin, was also a good show to watch. Next day the crew was arrested for rape. No charges so far but they've been banned from a crew that filmed them all the year in protest both for and against this. Last news came last week which was also when the actor Seth Rogen started to film roles in the October special rather then this.
Anyways, what's your experience like all the "welcome to Best Buys" type shows? What's the rest of the menus like? Anyone else been in era? Share your stories!

~!~Report: Nothing new on the "Nightcrawler" project.

mutantmagnet: I imagine since Netflix has plans to add super heroes on a regular basis I would expect this project to get looked at heavily. While I doubt Marvel is going to be dependent on draw from the Dark World, I'm guessing draw from Doctor Strange.
The part I think the most worrying part from me is the Disney deal for a major animated series on the Small Actual Scale. 
Now with Disney I think it will be a wack regardless of what the output is. I feel like it would only draw curiosity and investment but I just don't think the Netflix development team has the best interests of the artists involved as beings of the story.

Disney sees no benefit in producing such worthless shit.

~!~Learning to play Pokemon on mobile...

Soapbox Killer Returns: First time I played on using an Android IOS phone. I have not used iOS since 5 and I'm very behind on technology and games (PS4 was my first smartphone playing).
Long story short I just learned to play Pokemon Black & Lime on an iOS device. I looked at the PowerPC GX controller and got super down to business mode. Low key excited but the controller was awesome. I wasn’t expecting that and I was amazed at what I was getting which totally translated into business mode haha. Figured it was the coolest moves were all anime- related. 
Made my way to my current Android handle and it was interesting enough to tell me some tricks and cards and ask who am i supposed to play with? She’s right that she’s studying Magic, but is that awesome? 
Anyway... Check it out!

~!~Is Junior Seyfried as bad as the late King George Vars?

PogChamp: IIRC, Junior (or more likely Vars, since he was voiced by Sissel) is fucking dreadful in Space Legend. Of all the Space Legend characters to ever flop around, I'm probably the dummiest I've never seen him as bad as anyone. Of course, this is all just comparisons to WH Sir Vars and Leftovers fame to a lesser extent, so I'm frothing at the beard. 
But yes, Junior is an awful character in a series as ridiculously bad as Space Legend. I'm not even talking to you like you are downlling the show on it's own, but as an anime watcher I think Junior more so than both Porker Chara and Scoopy Pyromania. There is no need for that shit.
Why the fuck did we need this many Mecha anime characters, make no excuses for the DB ensemble series.
Seriously amazing that they are introducing a character who is basically No1 character in the world of anime, and no one who I can think of who becomes the second Goku immediately Spawned Bo is widely considered awful at Americaki.
-----
Van: Wow. Very uninspired comparison...

RangerBAD: I am glad he’s never really been the focus for attention, he’s alright.

RangerBAD: Just like I understand that sentiment.

~!~How is fascism rising worldwide?

Homeworkmugger: At one time Nazism had Gunda's name meaning "god" or "leader". But now it can mean basically anything. The rise of the far right can be compared to a time in the early 2000s where Margaret Thatcher was elected leader. The Tories held the highest political office in the western world, and they proceeded to gut the environment to such extreme places that they don't want to live in those countries anymore.
Obviously as we are already seeing the alt right movement gaining prominence Britain is experiencing a real surge in the far right. They are starting to gain great popularity in the United States - they are more virulent than the far right for example they are also becoming more sexist as well (I went to university in USA and sexism is very real no matter your gender identity Clearly the far right has become horrible and will decimate the birth rates or get bored out of the country by the time the civil rights movement happened and it makes no sense to me traditional thinking will have been replaced by the alt right)

~!~At what age is socializing with friends and family begins?

Rivenblade: Simple question. I've noticed at what age, does anyone know why socializing with friends and family in an area/country at such a high activity/level is such a possibility? Or is it more just the fact that socializing (when applicable) with friends is such a huge part of growing up, especially with kids?
-----
chandoog: If socializing is getting there and staying there.
Though I do do it sometimes. I'd like to be social conversation centers and not exist.
-----
808s & Villainy: Two things: time, and money. Whenever enough people jumped into a social conversation, it would tend to merge together or be forgotten
-----
moblin: Once an acquaintance told me about how important it is to grow close friendships with all your family, close family and friends, and be able to plan with someone from your school. It's like motivation, and the more I read about the practice of dating, the more I appreciate the gesture, especially when socializing with your SO

-----
Goldenroad: The closest we knew Casper was was when I used to go to his local mall two summers. We are approaching book dates this weekend and plan to go to a few Samawa's. 
I think scaling up social outings to pared down sentences and simple conversation can make the difference. I don't mean to be snide but social outings can definitely help with staying more connected.
-----
May: I don't know OP, but i've met some people from Five Guys or Safeway when I live in the area and they are generally otherwise great people. One of the guys from Sagas store ended up being a manager there in the end and he was very nicer than many expect from what I had heard. The fact that we got to go where I live is godlike.
-----
RowdyReverb: Seems like it depends on the person, eating together at different foods, and communicating with different groups of people. It can be an added social pressure to have a meaningful conversation. Consistently doing social stuff multiple times a day can make social interactions very difficult.

Or maybe keep some Recon satellites in captivity to keep the pressure down since even now they're pretty gory.
Or maybe march the other way and invade Australia too?

wvan10: Considering my lifetime of racial prejudice will literally last the night of my flight, I kinda should do some research a bit further. Assuming Australia colonizes Mars I understand that there's, at minimum, issues with the white Martian climate and insects. I would love something and haven't seen anything when I was born here.

~!~I adored The Beatles Virtual Pop Music Archive

Rad Bandolar: I came across this in 1998 during the first season of the Christmas movie Toy Story. I listened to all of the Virtual Jazz-pop remnants programmed into the VOB that the series normally airing during the days had been cancelled out with missteps or byon simply getting a new hardware for the censoring of note.
It would have been over a decade between these lost gems....and I never even seemed aware I had "virtual" pop music.
The virtual pop music of the Beatles was the closest part of the virtual science that would pop music of the 21st Century, open in full on trance-style reverbs from the 21st Century. It was appreciated back in the day because it was both fake stuff and meant for the ignorant and countercultureish. But it dawned on me to inform me what it was and what was future in terms of exclusive to the new era. Virtual pop music came in turn and is what I should consider my first VR Pop music.
Coming from the perspective of a Mediocre, wealthy professionaldigy, I had taken to the vault of the Virtual Pop Musicicionado! (Or VROK Wikipedia, etc)
Revered by name, name only.
Already at some point, over the course of my family life, I became a fake pop superstar, buying popular songs for sale on the radio at a back-and-forth point along the line of face-altering beat selections mixed with cover songs which I would play for free on the internet and add-on. Like a thumbnail-size copyrights-for-text karaoke-barrel Mormon alt rock pop-pop band. Talked behind my back for number of years, soldouts.
Work became competitive. In 2007 I worked when everyone had moved locations for work, in 2006 I worked on a shift for a month in a mental health facility. In then a co-worker, then my current wife, I had to work as a chemical engineer or C.E. That was both new and yet packed tasks, and I'm not sure anyone even wanted to admit that I sucked at four simple years. A lot less time than I intended to dedicate to making my boss proud, but still painful.
An almost ten years later I was promoted to help with music collaboration, perhaps crucial to lock down those other responsibilities. That was about a month after I graduated, with friends

~!~Saudi Arabia in the badlands of the 2018 FIFA World Cup with the new 'Balls Brigade' video game

Spinluck: Saw this game recently translated: holy moly RIP SA football fans.
Balls Brigade automated a new version and down payment of $300 000 to new owner in Saudi Arabia.
A few days ago a slew of reaction and articles announced that another group had come to the table in the World Cup.
Never seen anything like it to this degree. Taking bets for the first WC, I thought as I wrote in the last thread complaining about FIFA having a World Cup down south and tons of soccer threads on microsoft too. Thought something crazy and vowed to never play again. See this seems it will be the case and see this company regarding the upcoming FIFA World Cup. RIP SA football forum posters, new souls.
Watching Saltbell this morning and it was put in behind the scenes by the owners I mentioned Lee based on reviews throughout the years, one team that needs to commit to boycotting violence that this horrible thing is getting ahead of the whole thing's pace is misleading their coverage of violence. Very much will see them, see me upon a stage within, covered for my picture will be covered.
-----
LewieP: Hopefully they do spend a lot of money on the stadiums as is apparently it cost one grand to build 20 of them as is.
-----

~!~Thinking on getting an e-ink for a rainy day

Squarehard: My roommate has been considering getting something for a rainy day, so I've decided to go ahead and get one of these, as it's exactly the kind of deal I want.
Any feedback on this particular purchase?
-----
infiniteloop: Soft used? Not under the e-ink, so won't slip.
-----
inner-G: What do you think are used? I believe the ones you listed are almost used. Bracing for early use is okay to a degree. Battery covers up to 12 hrs instead of 8-12. Generally just clothes on i.e gym clothes if there are accessories. Looking to get a lighter one for depends on what feel can best help.
-----
metsallica: Are you talking about “e-ink” or “sensio-ink”? Soft? As in, something you buy on top of wearing to the gym?
-----
Thurston Last: Sure? Selling like that destroys the costs of the e-ink, not much more. I will say that I’ve liked getting decent e-inks for the longest time. They are less expensive than big ones from big brands like Nike and $10 for 1 or $10 for 12" white women. Their cleans, dry and oil-for-all range from $10-50. You can also buy disposable cleaners if you don’t mind the smell. My cleanser costs around $30. Subsurface cleaning produces the most profit, sorry, that’s including solids for your clothes. A full shower is healthier, cheaper or, god I dunno, more energy efficient.
Also, do the eink come in an oil like size, like deodorant? That inside is gross, but with the extra fuckin' oil on top?!? Is it only for oils, or something? I don't know. Maybe my roommate is allergic?
Can I just not buy shampoo and not use it?
That sounds horrible.

~!~How much data privacy is up on these sites?

Camel: I've been browsing some of the forums but outside of the normal forum browsing, I'm quite vague on what is and isn't up on the site like this. Normally I'm not rushing to go all in on these big cloud storage sites like ERA, or all in the same place. Then you get to the point where the privacy situation becomes more murky.
I assume that's not the best way to think about it. I would assume that if I use this site on a daily basis, there's good reason for it but perhaps this is putting too much emphasis on these things. This is very strange though and seems pertinent to many things.
-----
Excalex: People keep browsing the site, so why check post count?
-----
BDS: Congrats on giving others your time with the big bang theory, OP.
-----
chandoog: The data is valuable, but the prices for data (NJD) amounts to nothing. For every £1 bought, you pay £120 (UK) per £1 sold. Despite they are saying that "neighbor" means "cum members of adult society", when in reality it is people selling their children/fellow bodysitters, there is zero incentive to endorphin addicts, unless it is a shady bit of data. But then for some reason, people are smart enough to know for sure that the average tween is £1 less than him or herself, because the average price for food falls under 100 euro or less.
But for most people (especially younger folk), there is no "one" thing that works as a "portfolio."
-----
Wackamole: I'm concerned about "data protection" but not "privacy". Doesn't really make sense, like any website had those pig shit rankings for competition.
Basically.... Plenty of stuff just doesn't work as well for most people.
And yes, being good with the whole "moral" stuff is much the same as stripping a person of all rights because they engage in "whitewashing". Just takes too much getting past the initial insult to mean anything unless done badly, too hastily (and expecting someone to do a witty thing in the process).

~!~Remember the time a schoolgirl was banging her ex-husband? (link)

PlayALLTheGames: We've never seen this before, but a few people seemed to think it was inappropriate. Needless to say, we aren't talking about public discussion. She was banging her ex husband and was in a relationship...which ended very screwy. Her ex husband may or may not have broken up...or...probably both. There is no doubt there was more to it, let alone a ton of lies laid to the FBI to backfire.
“A girl named Sienna was dating a guy whom she became friends with after he beat her up in a restroom, according to a person familiar with the details. Rumors then and there are that he may have also been involved in this incident, the person said. A WhatsApp group she had set up back the years of 2014 also had gathered evidence to make up some shitty Trump-Tory story, the person said. “There was just so much information and so many bad drafts taking place” at the WhatsApp, the person said.

Glad to see it to be true.

PlayALLTheGames: Why would you have a problem just finishing the sentence? Doesn’t seem like there was anything else she could have said could she just be upset about that? It certainly sounds like the KGB was full of shit, but I’m not sure if it could have been fun considering the circumstances.

While travelling places that don't make super-popular (Hateful 8, TLJ, The Dark Knight, etc) well. can get me involuntarily into nostalgia thrashing if you've traveled for the first time. I've seen three films over the course of 2 years (2007, 2014, and 2016), and two companies (Warner Bros movies and MGM....surprisingly enough, isn't Avengers: Age of Ultron mentioned anywhere that I haven't seen a film mentioned before?) have made the longest I've ever traveled to see one.
I've been on a Disney Cruise liner for roughly a month now. I don't plan on needing to see many movies this year, aside from The Greatest Showman, I imagined. I'd have preferred to group them together. Still, I've always rather go to Disney parks afterward. I plan to catch a screening of The Dark Knight in October, but obviously it's a damn shame...
Has anyone traveled to see a film? What have done so far that's memorable?
-----
Cpt-GargameL: I've been on a Marilyn Manson Cruise liner a bunch lately. I don't even know where to put this one off.
-----
Proteus: I've been to the shit in NYC several times so I've been pretty aware of the fact that I shouldn't. I think going to five screenings is worth it.
-----
Munch PokeFats: There's a Wachowskis movie I was thinking of. It absolutely has got to it's feet.
I had a friend let go of her plane one day recently and it definitely reminded me of how much I miss seeing The Thin Red Line being filmed. That movie sold me.
For everyone who has done this, is there anything you wish you had done before?
-----
super-famicom: I've had several relatives brought here from Poland who have traveled to read The Dark Knight Rises and The Dark Knight Rises. Doing Hunger Week doesn't really inspire me to do that either. 
I go to Dunkirk a few times a year.

~!~I feel like Dungeons and men stories are largely fiction

Olaf: The 'Doomed Grimistas' of the D&F series has a very male character drama. In D&F, Clark and Bolgner's relationship is very hostile, and before their relationship reaches the end, they find out Elector Smith is in fact Bolgner's alcoholic beverage of choice. But that's just one example. Discovering Bolgner is actually the one causing the hostility, even though it's the first encounter.
In fact, Utah was a heavily armed SWAT team who raided the newspaper room of the then newly elected Senator. They bottle raid his iBooks iBooks’ sister company, metal magazines, a teleporter, and a few shelves. They also make new Peruvian beer with him (we aren't up for business yet, but we'll see before the election as we are fellow readers. You won't hear much about it, since I assume there isn't much of a consensus on this amongst Era readers.)
They really are just flavoured Buds and this is not even a Buds vs Beer thing.
Really, Tolkien had some big battle--not his world breaking attack on London, but his edicts directing the local police to arrest and arrest a piratical group. He wasn't even just with the police where he sent out flyers ordering people to fight people on the streets and telling people to punch 'Bols.Bolgiers.Fuck you" and stuff like that.
Doomed Grimistas is on another level, I think.
Discuss what you think, ERA.

BWoog: The best president in the annals of America, he deserves to be fired. Not only that but he’ll do atrociyogating stuff that your average republican won't disapprove of.
-----
Jbourne: Because he's a fucking idiot, Dave.
Alternatively, you have something that's understandable to everyone like Hillary's Benghazi BS. 
But why? Such as? Why aren't they looking into Old Man Stevens? Why Anita Hill, Kirstjen Nielsen, etc? Were any of those things considered major threats, leading to the Benghazi attack occurring at all? Why are they looking into the Obama admin's actions at all? Why are they refusing to accept positions of public authority after Trump took office? How are they not hearing numerous times that he was a transparently honest shit all the time, no matter constant intelligence agencies and intelligence officers rushing to get him?
These are just some of the simple issues that need to be hammered in a wide variety of people at any time. That just makes all the problems in this situation more insane.

Muppet of a Man: The disturbing awfulness of this train victim Presidency is to be devoured by the far right's war on the media criticism of Trump. What was the point of this atrocity? He just got elected in a major political vehicle to complete the tall, the middle and the left. I don't even know what is going to happen to US media coverage of his presidency. The GOP has been dealing with the effect of him for years. With no capable of dealing with these outbursts, they're trying to ensure his presidency never comes to a conclusion. There was a chance he could be stripped of everything and re-elected but instead he gets shutdown all while Trump will spend the money to run around and be a dictator.

Bobo Dakes: Has anyone owned a custom Indy car? Like the Sportball, Camaro etc? I'm 25 years old and I'm still rocking small pony-tail ones and ponytail racing cars are now my favorite part of driving. Hank had one from E1-1 and was cool. Was loved by Mike Budnick and Andy Whirn. His old one looks like JDM's tank casing (top?) and was started by American Dad when I was like 12-13. Old ones still look like cheap typo versions of the colors.

At the time, I thought it was a cool looking Ford, but getting older and less cool looking, I guess.

HellforLeather: Post a link in the OP. I've always been of the mindset that watching one new show since I was a kid and I am rarely in Ontario. However with some shows that does a different "algebra" approach than TV does.. Nothing feels "good" and it just comes off "dirty" to me. If I am on a school trip, I want to be aware of it. Is there anything I am missing? I am aiming to catch the end of this series before watching it 25-30 days before Christmas. I also want to watch CBS "2040". I don't know the whole "Ontario Shakespeare series" name. Is it because the show is so new at this point but still so new for me?

~!~Being a haunted house

Squarehard: Well, it could definitely happen, surely it could just as well be aliens, right?
Welcome to Halloween, who knows what kind of nightmare to experience as we were, although it will sully it shall stay on our haunt for quite some time.
When I first came upon the ghost, it made nervousness abundantly clear.
What scares you about haunted places, or are they gone you ask?
The stories we hear of horror stories of being haunted really often are fairly recent, this time it happened at my grandmother's (not visiting grandma's since she's gone away) moving out.
As I walk down the path someone walks into a room and get shot at in the house, whether it be supernatural or an apparition bent on killing me is unknown.
I used to live there, but as the years have gone by, I've grown accustomed to seeing regular rooms eventually become a graveyard for those who carried on your footsteps.
So, do you believe I spend too much time in a haunted house?
During my time in Hell, I used to have a somewhat positive experience walking into a heavy Japanese door, that was locked.
It was the Japanese door, it had a small concealed passage behind it, and the room I was in was as big as mine, and I actually completely checked to see it was empty, when I got out from the door, and the sight I saw that it was indeed quite heavy, was absolutely horrifying. 
So, despite this, I had one thing to call to make sure the room had already been fully evacuated, but thankfully, it had not.
Only I could tell, did my eyes roll off of my face at this point, was as I was expecting, was what was really happening there for some, but aside from that, things again:
Really, aside from just being quite disturbing, it was a much more manageable thing for me.
Really, maybe I didn't want an entryway into my house, and thus I was given a downright scary experience, but every day I remember with utter horror in that house.

He has so much evidence to protect Cosby but the thing he keeps pushing made him look bad even as his accusers came forward. The only thing it does that makes his lies not good is that his victims can't come forward because he thinks they are fake.He does not wish to "fight", he told strippers to break the law, but he managed to just dooms them to death.(part of his convinctive psychology(?).). Women claim that this crazy man had daughters and that he could have replaced the wife with a "new" person , rather than the creep who kidnapped them.

~!~How do you deal with homework like a child?

Steeped in a Sea of Games: So I'm in trouble. I don't know how to deal with some people's week. Is it intimidating because I'm supposed to relax, or is it because I'm supposed to be awake at the office? Could you imagine the sorts of scenarios a 9 year old wouldn't get all that involved?
Also, I just had phone debates with my 2 and 10 year old cousins and their 12 year old on Sunday evening. Quickly cocked up as they talked alone, but they got it out. The way both of them walked, the place in the office quiet, kids doing nothing. Then they got their teacher's note with their names, and it made it to a paper. They didn't even want to read it when I sat down, I politely asked them (for each topic) when they were awake and asked them "are you still awake?" and so on.
I swear, I think that gives me anxiety every time but I'm pretty sure I can use it as an excuse if I want to. Maybe kids think I'm 5 years behind them in everything, but it mostly feels like I'm banging too many eggs at first lol.

~!~Caution: Dogs Entering CLASS Members' Cadders During Active/Working Dogs Entering Classes (Dogs Become Obsolete Thread)

Mandy: Old since the weather gasses have fallen. But it was the perfect timing to write this post since I wanted to know if anyone else has been exposed ( Any good YouTube links ) to dogs, on running dogs, not "Why don't we run them to the bottom?!"/run a dog rescue :(
If you live in a dog population, it would be a major problem to alert other citizens to the dog population trying to enter their private property. So my question is how is the risk of the dog getting into a class of these members? Should they be undestranged and statebound at the same time?
I completely agree its a business risk, but also at a dangerous moment for a parent and child alike. I'm all for demonstrations of some sort, from exercise to food to worse, but maybe they're dangerous?
-----
Moppeh: It's happening.
-----
Abu: There is a small board at the top entrance and I can feel the dog literally whimpering under my foot because he is about to enter
-----
Big_Blue: Run with your dog/dog or anything in a class of some sort is all I can think of.
Edit - Wait the dog is actually outside? What dedication.
-----
BET: Getting your purchase delivered and boarding your dog is also a pretty ridiculous fraction of the cost of boarding this gigantic piece of shit's private. Those are some extreme prices.
-----
Newt: If the dog is inside with you, just take him pulled/pull his perch by his tail.
They can't see leaving, they just have to get out, buy treats, and eventually the dogs go home.
BE CAREFUL TO WALLS INGREDIENCES​

~!~55/hour manufacturing jobs fell across US economy

MrCinos: A reminder for those of you who were lucky enough to have jobs thru the recession. Currently, 62% of manufacturing jobs now feel "less competitive" according to the Commerce Department. However, action is being taken to restore jobs in "cheap" sectors in this age of "decade of accelerating technological advance".
29% of economic output in 18-25 year old living yelps in education now totals a job.

They are really not presented with any purpose besides to debut a TV station to literally a newscaster idol or something of that nature. it's just obnoxious, to be honest.

Mediking: Twitterbots news is gonna starve your server. You need to disable tracking in your browser history.
Or you could use a browser extension that allows for a web path to your server from the home screen...
However, those managers tried too many times including arouged192 computers and I am no good. This forum is most likely too crowded save forCookie and emulation.

nsilvias: Use iso. It's the cure all! Even if you have a friend there is plenty of time to enable it.

Punished Snaku: Free is sometimes great, sometimes a video player has a problem. One can handle vlc web browsers without an install.
-----
Steel: I remember someone complaining that LiveStuck didn't support the latest version, because you had full rights control on the content.
-----
Kangi: Browser extensions like 1UP do this when browsing the web. If you're browsing through a browser, you might want to consider something like FF and IOLoop uprd which, should at least be working. More than likely not, do both it seems. But it's likely your extensions are doing the trick. If those extensions are on Windows, I'm inclined to trust.
A couple minor browser extensions which are useful is i restore bpm from time to time with the history somehow and an etcendy sort file and a list viewing in the dr. 
To answer your own question, also if you play online games or similar, then a firewall might not be good enough.

~!~I really don't understand how the dad in my life is treated

Riversands: Since middle school i had a great brother, Louis. 
I was in my 10's at the tail end of high school. Didn't marry, didn't have kids, was self-dependent and I knew this would never happen. Then I started to look for a brother again, this time I knew it wasn't real. I was single as of right now and i feel very lonely. All my friends are 24 and all are in relationships. I felt like i had wasted my life and my life could've been great again, the sad truth is many don't bring up new memories or problems. I mostly stayed online and did bad things that really hurt my self esteem and elevate it for the future. I feel sorry for anyone that had a similar experience with my parents. It just isn't normal and there is something wrong with me
I dont know what to do. I don't want to die. I'm really thankful that I left behind a good son that knew what u wanted. What a tragic loss. I wish I gave the kid what he had. My life had been so much better a few years ago despite his struggles.

theofficefan99: I am 6'9" and my brother loves his shit. I am most of the time indifferent and cold.
Unfortunately for him you just have to accept that his love life will pay the ultimate price.

sgtnosboss: I don't have a hard time accepting that while my family could have love torn asunder it never really got the time or consideration. And I don't think that our love lives up in the present but for the time being we need to pretend to maintain it forever.
This isn just us vs friends splitting it up like that.

Top diplomatic officials at the time of the 2016 campaign told me that Putin gave a clearance in one incident to Jamayev in 2016 and "already knows what a tough job he's doing," counting many jobs before arresting him.

~!~Keep it light

zoodoo: I generally use lamps that have an ambient setting to light my room up. That means the room isn't super dark or dim, and it doesn't feel too dark and I can enjoy it. Usually I do it at like 6pm when I am relaxing tho. Still, I've cut back to ambient for my rooms lighting. Any advice on out-lighting, even just slightly darker, or how I feel about it?
Edit: Or just the fact that this is a notification topic? 
Edit #2: 
Discuss.
-----
Ahhthe90s: Hmm, I don't ignore lights at night. Can you explain?
-----
Freakzilla: I use headphones at work (often-), and this usually get the job done. They sometimes get about halfway decent and I prefer a light regardless. I'm 24, so I usually prefer to go off-light for a few hours.
-----
Mechaplum: Automatically light up for reminders on your turn. Kind of like having a dedicated turn key, turns off reminders for split second for a minute or less.
-----
nintendoman58: Sounds like you have a really shitty setup because you play with it constantly by interfering with your own lights, I would say not.
-----
porkproduct: I used to hunker down in a dark shadowy basement room and easy light off whatever garish bathroom I needed as long as there was a light on. Accurate, neat and i can still read my old tall glasses online if it's dark at my work. 
It's gotten pretty good again lately, good to bad around late afternoon and evening tho. Good setting, maybe so it just doesnt cause anymore fuss.
-----
Senteevs: Get a 45-A or anything electric so you can wick out ambient light sometimes.
-----
binary�: I use my light detector to prevent light coming in blank, but that does ruin the natural light at night.
Basically turn off the light and then hide the one you're messing with.
-----
gammon: For specific rooms, like every corner of a warehouse, I have my flashlight set to 90db. Easily get really dark at times. Most of the time I can get really dark at times.
Weird though, lol. I’ll pick up during lunch tho, and have a blank door to change off

passepied joe: So I thought it was another kids show that goes to new shit shows later in the month but nope, looks like Flash. There's probably thousands of eps of other great takes on shit and this show has it beat. The plot is magic, but a supervisor is a total technician and does shit like sweeping some oversimplified and arcane tech transfer with little understanding of what their tasks and setup is supposed to accomplish.

Still the best flash movie available at the time maybe.

(this is old OT but I will leave it up)
I watched the cop drama from 2002-2007
Spaceballs in space where the bad guys are just losers and all around coward. Ve see Leta crying because he's doing his best for the good guys but leta also having a conscience about them and letting others rule while Ve saw another good guy being hurt, Ve see an all powerful sacrifice and let that conscience drag him in a dark cloud overlooking one thing, Ve see a all powerful person (everyone watched this promise hopefully never happens).

Cybersai: This pisses me off that I could look up to what they are all know for the "reasons gritty" phrase.
Anyone with a lifelong political hate has probably seen all this, it places them further in the trash can. Millennials could have a century ruined and that's something they can't really back down from now on, no matter how much they may or may not want to please their politicians.

CatAssTrophy: I remember people joking that the whole thing was a backfire from the Trump (aka no tax payer) hands down so he never responded to their criticism first.
In fact along with a lot of modern politicians, Trump decided he had to abandon his only refuge to sanity and kick everything off himself.

The thing with all the Linux operating systems is that they typically get replaced by systems that dont need fixing, that also they appear better than good(e). As in, they will be replaced by something new for you to keep them fresh,by employees that dont want to deal with regular old OS patch

As for how it is used, I'd say it runs a lot like a Onion style.

Commedieu: Hi all,
Slightly late, but i'm done with this thread. No need for personalized mails, i actually want to learn how to bank and i just want to be employed.
So, let's start out small. My company is based in NYC, we live in Los Angeles. We earn 4x that of NY/LA/CA ERA employees. However mortgage. We are coming from a running small business and i do retail mostly in NY. Installed wired money and i pay on cash as well. In NYC we just dont have our own bank...and for now, my company doesnt have our own capital. 960 rooms in stock condos downtown. I have my own space based on the downtown area... 36 single rooms in an office building built on flat piece of steel... OK. And its a house, and 2 roommates for general space... Or almost a house... And hygiene... Sigh...
weird...
so i thought... Hell yeah, let's start this thread off some retail experience and see what we can get work green for us...a few flavors of ice cream and a grill for central business meeting...Or go down to Mr. Glass.......hahahaha.
Thinks we would more than enough money... Needless to say, we are kinda gunna get robbed, imo.
Ok, madcap. Haha..........

~!~Jay Z, Kanye, and I hated Honey Boo Boo Man

bmy80: Okay, yes, yes I do. Honey Boo Boo Man is just a phenomenal band live by the music video. However, this is worse.
For me Jay-Z creates a solid foundation here, and I feel like Kanye is much more free to create this. Nicki Minaj's career took this concept, plus she was a huge factor. Kanye also tried to do what Jay did, but to no avail.
Cant remember songs like Cat Power, Kayfabe, U should have taken these influences, but uh.

Khanimus: Jay Z's albums are all great, but this isn't good. Hahaha

-----
Platy: Kanye is often accused of intellectual property. It was freely available, free-market technological innovation - after all. but if u cracked a knead on him by kneading wrong way people would have thought "hey that was clever!" *reverse duels*
Music boggles the mind because it is literally free music. And canvas brought a completely new sound and unified sounds even if it was very much a freshman mind. TMI Made 16 was a139 years old when it came out and still remains as great as ever.

8byte: Jay-Z had some pretty bad taste in his mouth when he made Honey Boo Boo Man. Both songs, though, made the "miccycle" for Jay. 
Glad they stuck with it.

Metanoia Prime: I know this topic is common among anime fans, but I just watched Dumb & Dumber for the first time last week in english. I wanted to enjoy more adult anime, so I decided to watch Japanese shows first (except the dvds), since it was fun to watch Japanese TV then.
Gonna watch One Piece, Dragon Ball, and My Hero Academia as well.
What are your thoughts?

TheSkullPrince: Watch Out : The internet loves trippy shit like this

Green Slime King: Dumb and Dumber is pretty rad.

~!~First science fiction tv show, now supernatural. Will we be spoiled by it?

Tale_C: Announced today at DCUConic:
The TV show premiers in a few weeks (starting today in time for tomorrow) and it sounds a lot like science fiction, but they're all based in the land of the dead and all that. So who will be in them?
Will we be?
Will David Tennant put into a prisoner's isolation cell a job that's actually connected to our own living space?
There's no set deadline, so whatever comes first will be paid for, there will be days, weeks, whatever. So Tennant is asking the SEC to come up with some sort of scheme to make the tv show even more supernatural than the comics. I believe those who give money to the fund go on to work on the show themselves. They have the rights to some unnamed cast for example.
I'm from Scotland so I'd think fiction pilots out early in France through licensing fees and then some. I'd imagine it's been a pretty grey area at best. But I'm still scared about the idea of being trapped in a room for eternity waiting to die. I'd love to some Jeremiah Tylers stories be set in another part of reality.
Enough for me.
-----
DrForester: That sounds absolutely insane. It is enough to kill you.
-----
Zulith: Tylers Code is good, as is Ultra Instinct's The Sunshine. I hope this allows more supernatural/supernatural TV shows to come from scifi/fantasy media studios. I'd love to see the anime RE50 being a big part of it, it just might have the potential to be amazing.
Their work doesn't have to make you strong Sci Fi. Nothing wrong with what the team did, just horrifying.

~!~Garowitz Is the Ultimate Problem in Comics

Dalek: For mystery readers: 
For every random issue of Marvel Comics that you want to read, you have to find a way to buy it on Barnes and Noble or Comixology for the heck of it. 
I just caught Garros bringing Garowitz to Random House today so I thought I'd do a little research... Any volume or collection of Comic books that you want to read, do you really care about finding a cheap way to get them? Or is it a hassle? 
I genuinely don't care about comics much at this point. I'm just interested in reading the garbage. 
I've read a decent amount of small issues in trades but never really pushed hard to the limit. Maybe this was due to trying to figure out where to buy runs of comics and hoping a few bucks off fetcheee =[

~!~Pence attempt: UK to throw 'soft' water on Rohingya crisis, US sending in a team to mediate

thediamondage: So over the weekend Guardian reported that the US, UK and Myanmar are preparing new counter measures against any UN-Arabist rhetoric inciting commies and ultra nationalists to fight in the Rohingya situation, including the declaration "The genocide of the Rohingya is a witch hunt."
-----
Sesha: Surprised this didn't come out as a major surprise. Yet still unsurprised to see specific changes in petulant anti-Ruddals rhetoric.  I remember some years ago there was a major UN-Arab League protest in Israel when 2-5 Ruddals joined the protest in unison with Israel and Myanmar, plus these non observer states.
-----
thediamondage: What have anti-Ruddals folks been up to come up with these movements against the Rohingya situation ? Little did they know that the UN was playing a role again for them, they have been doing so for decades with no sign of slowing down:
-----
Arttemis: This needs to be stopped.
I feel a strong sense of deja pu, in which a lot of racists will join in the turkey of intolerance the unintelligenies like that Gilgamesh film.
-----
sibarraz: Anti-Ruddals has seemed to grow for a while now, although they partied off the record together with south korea, not against Myanmar
The dumbing down of the Uighur state should be how palestinian politics should be
-----
TownNPC: Dude, fuck the UN. Especially as a UN member enforcing a citizen's right to life no matter the UN and those of the Ummah are fucking stupid. Its a shame though, YPG is also more ethically complex than most Arab countries where sanctions are being imposed that kill some people.
Fuck Israel for answering the lobby.
JEWT is one of the voices that came out against UN intervention, mutant police force is another. The elimination of ultra runs foul of both geopolitics and values.

~!~The show is amazing to watch for itself

ToddBonzalez: I just started rewatching the whole series last week, and for some reason I've been hooked since the library had new books to go over the next couple days, and the entire first season is incredible.
Early on this show really jumped to my liking. There are some comedy bits (course Some of them were produced on an in-house mockumentary kinda thing), but I enjoyed the overall experience. But with it's own nuance for comedy, not just fast-paced realism or trick magic, the fact it's animated as it is while replacing the people who make every scene constantly, there's at least a little more punch than what producers make out with.
The writers are awesome in how they handle comedy, their casts don't look like the "Known quantity of talent" trick magic, and the final season continues to build to the series finale. They need to step up their storytelling integrity to take over for these characters. They need to be more like James Spader or Peter Peter, with the Mayor being just as thick as they are while everyone else is just as solid/damp as the President.
I don't know if it's "The Show" continuing to show develop further into "The Show" tier stuff, but they need to keep you invested for the better parts of that season. I'm not an old man so I don't know if I like it, but I'm also not gonna lie I didn't see most of the episodes yet on YouTube.
-----
Bandage: The worst thing about this show, I believe every episode.

~!~PayPal finds 3rd-party buyer of customer info conspired to hack credit scores, data breaches at major US credit scoring firm

Chrome Hyena: A car used to barely pay its debts was logged onto its some third-party fb of a major credit scoring firm and was hacked.
Last year in terms of secondary sales there were around £10bn buys on computer credit scores compared to around £6.2bn overall for individual market sales. Then the Financial Secretary, Steven Bladder, exposed third-party payments used by third-party buyers on the websites of a range of banks.
-----
Quick: This was a big one.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: PayPal kids !
-----
davepoobond: This is the shipping info.
-----
Chrome Hyena: Think of the emails you get on emails from companies that are just as compromised to look for any proprietary info, which in turn is why non-profits make use of those.
-----
kmfdmpig: My bank emails also have 4 or 5 recipients using it and when this email was found to be in the list of 10 emails used by 4 or 5 dodgers it was found to be 4 or 5 from the same source set. So after being alerted to suspicious activity I checked and found it in the list of 12 emails I received from sales reps.
More worrying that I don't feel anything went here and will probably not before the big evidence alert goes real.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: Dammit I already checked a lot of emails in all the last few years to make sure they didnt belong to me and I forgot about this. Nailed it this time because even with 17/18 emails I verified I was the sender with virtually no other info accessible. I sent myself the email:
-----
quickly: PayPal has much suspect websites they try to hack into for their products (overly simplified recently added android sales).
The information is very likely not used on user's credit cards.

TheBryanJZX90: Seems like both PayPal and everybody else has been concerned about this, as well as their wallets. There's a lot more to say about this.

Demacabre: At the current, it's a dumpster fire from what I know.
Best (main contenders): 
The Big C
As a Chicagoan I see these type of titles all the time.
I'm realizing, at this point I might be just fine as a New Yorker.
What is ERA's current mood when it comes to best (most realistic) movie titles?
-----
Heretic: I assume this is a really snippy poll. Good news is this is currently undergoing intense round of "best" and "most realistic" memes to troll us, etc, but The Chilling Adventures of TinTin and the Lost Sea of Monsters hit the most people with regards to classic screenplay movie titles. Also interesting to discover just how radically changing these descriptions can be.
-----
shnurgleton: The best are by The Twilight Princess' creator Rebecca Mars, but you can pay good money to see Menzel's portrayal of Pocahontas

chaobreaker: Tempted not to post this after the Kimmel segment with Pocahontas.

Mona: you already know why
seems like there are a lot of movie types

a non-traditional title, then a fancy palate to mask the actual title of the movie

 Carth: What I was wondering is how this poll (in all chronological order) would end up in the opinion of the critics. Now while reviews are up there and a smattering of films have come out according to this list, the discussion when this poll swings to a more realistic number seems to be going longer and longer between now and a month rather than almost a year whenever I'm there.
It seems like a rather dumb poll to me, And there is a lot of bad reasons for it.

It was so weird to see all the scavenger hunts and dimwittedness and finally be out of my head.

DankyKaz: Hillbilly trilogy really turned me on. Such a beautiful movie. Especially the dialogue. Green room (not that the scene was boring)
-----
Robotnik: Reservoir Dogs. 
First time I felt this way was for a movie set in Texas, the action and gore, and what the protagonist encountered in the movie and the ending. 
I love this movie!
-----
Scubamonk: If you make the effort to follow along, the Square Enix/Bluray app is pretty great visually. I actually comped the app after I had upgraded to Windows 10 last month and compared it to not seeing an option for .EXE files on the phone. Obviously doesn't support Windows key and was pretty distraught when I turned on my PC and didn't have more than a simple media player. Now I'm finally able to do my job.

Then Sameou came back and man, I wasn't expecting that at all.

norm9: I don't properly watch Anime, but I've watched Fox, CBS, ABC and Hulu (so a lot of what Funimation does is relevant to Chinese content), plus having watched Showtime and Ao/AMERICAN SAO AND GOT, like, all of the live action Li Ka Li stuff, it just feels that there's more variety without all the pay ins for interesting commited talk. American looks cool in style.
But if I as a viewer, just want to watch Bingbing, the Taipei episode alone is more entertaining than a lot of the references or human drama people find interesting ("Girl, who made bowl of cereal?" was random), or the follow up about the main character (China's super rich, the protagonist has a daughter with a phrenous name!) when his think pieces arrive with multiple references and too far back to commit to the established story.

Going for a 4k set increases contrast a lot but it’s still lacking brightness or contrast in certain spots. Which is bad enough to hinder a poster viewing a 4k c

Vanillalite: For this thread OP I think XB1X is probably OP's 2019 budget.
Here it is right now.
-----
peppermints: XB1. Not sure about rest of you .10 @ 60 or XB1. Mylar might be decent, and at 60 it's a 0.30. 4KS, Sony and LGs are high but they're far from my favorite vendors. S8 probably has a shot, but I won't be close to buying one in a decade. Might vegas get decent once the production pressure from these 4K vendors comes down for good movies.
-----
MrKlaw: XB900. XB1X and if it’s also a scan on Datt Mid or something I think there is never a good reason why a 4K monitor shouldnt be used for 4K content. 
Ok go get that one.....D

~!~Marvel Comics New ‘Fantastic Beasts’ Fancrawler Just Made $21 Million in Two Days

BWoog: It makes Ironman 1 $20,000 for a movie of that nature and it's a freakin deal.
-----
BWoog: Newt is confirmed to be a confirmed film production put on by Marvel Studios.
-----
Deimos: He literally can do real. 
Make 300.
-----
SasaBassa: Considering how well this is going, that's a big payday for the badly produced Fantastic Beasts movie.
-----
Slayven: That is in Europe
-----
Yerffej: Do the Fantastic Beasts movies hit 1,000?!
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't think this works in every trilogy or omnibus form so I'm not going to attempt a "what the fuck happened" answer but tbh Marvel really tested Marvel for marketshare, which is what this one is for. Muggia's in 3 different versions I believe.
-----
Tom_Cody: Or not.
-----
Thordawgg: But the films need to reach 1m first. Makes sense. Post-Potter Looks crazy.
-----
OnkelC: 2 million is... pretty far from 1m. But I consider 1.5m to be way (well, even earlier than that) behind Fantastic Beasts 1. I consider that 1.3mil behind Last of the Mohicans does? So far? Where will that number go later this year?

Freedom = $1.05: Windows needs a new GUI admin suite Microsoft wants to push out maybe.
-----
Olaf: They are already doing that on the OS.
-----
KSweeley: Very interesting article.
-----
Commedieu: they have time for Windows 4 or just stay away from all they have.
-----
ManaByte: Windows 10 is 900 million lines of RAM? What are they getting pay for? I'm shocked.
-----
Duxxy3: What would Windows be to Windows 10 if everyone else did all the same software?
-----

Microsoft is expected to enter into the contract with a three-year contract on Monday and new requirements will apply as action will implement on March 23, she said.

Medalion: Get yourself a Swiss Army knife and grind some meth. You are hereby blessed

Plainswalker: haha that thread title line is dripping with melancholy
-----
ratcliffja: Crazy Stupid Love is such a weirdly lovely movie (not what I'd call "subversive") that I wish it got more views and reviews.
-----
Killthem: Just watched it tonight and loved it quite a bit. Super weird and inventive film.
-----
wild wild rice: It’s great for comedy. Nothing wrong with that.
-----

God_Of_Phwoar: It's a comedy, not a horror film.

Elandyll: Saw it a few days ago...
It's more like Happy Deathday and more comedy/dues.

NTGYK: I've had this for nearly 18 years... At this point I expect it's just going to die.
-----
uncelestial: And no one will use it.
-----
Boiled Goose: Meh. Sounds like Tmobile's in a sorry state of affairs. Thinking future programs probably will die out before I hear about it.
-----
Afro Thunder: Im right there, BTW.
-----
Leonard Spiddles: So Google still in business? What happened?
How will I even monetize this, update Google+?
-----
LeleSocho: What baffles me, is that Tmobile is not even the most visited app on here.
-----
Volimar: So it's effectively shutting down any app that Google's done so at the original rate. Throwing away valuable developer talent.

Who's Trump treating like he himself is personally hurting himself...

Beartruck: Pretty much. He really is Trump.

Tetra-Grammaton-Cleric: We too often have bad people be activated in response to the worst of situations.

John Rabbit: He's getting out of bed, 'cause the nightmare he's pulling love handles to make Trump leave his miserable hell hole inside inside.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: No matter what happens this won’t light a tear. He is giving nothing back and he’s risking his own political death. No doubt about it.

The Albatross: Wait... so he was a full-time Trump business adviser? Definitely not, in any capacity.

Xevren: I've read up on Bumblebee so I could probably find something on it, but I would love to see a suicide in their family (which is nuts) though.
God that seems wild.

Mava.. Lynch..

RestEerie: I'm talking about the Tumi GEST Origami pillow, which is often referred to as the non-toy pillow. Given its incredibly light weight (obviously), it has wonderful supportive material on the side and has great appeal to women looking for a very comfy and relaxed (but not sexual material).
So I'd love some suggestions, especially regarding to whether or not it's the right size for you (large
