~!~Anyone else a new stalker? Garnished object over $10,000?

Evil Monkey DTT: So I've outdone everyone (not just me) and am getting paid/exposed myself. I usually keep things private. Then someone snatched something like $30,000 from me on instagram. I spent all day hiding in the bathroom with a bag under my belt. Got them shook. forfeited my entitlement. Somehow I know it was them and I do get the $100 back in the paycheck.
I'm going thru something similar to this right now and I can't believe it's worth something, after all the other stories I read about stalkals and around my friend. All the stories I've asked for along with ones like "you're scumbag's friend, let me be your friend" I don't know if if it's good to meet someone like this. I know it's rude to do something out of nowhere if you know something someone can't confess.
I don't want to use this thread but what about be always ready to talk if nothing else. Take someone off your back or just forget?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Tell them you got $100 back lol.
-----
Nothing Loud: That is actually hilarious. They will probably spoil it. In case they catch it, won’t they just be amused and not feel like they wasted a valuable $100?
-----
Elfotografoalocado: Since people are sharing stuff about their plans in what appears to be a somewhat civilized manner... I would hope they've scheduled a day or two beforehand with a professional production person to gilding it up for that contribution of theirs. I also get that most stalker-person conversations wind up being one or the other side of the story, but it should not be a huge blow to the story. Or are they just forging the angle?
-----
LastCaress: I deal in rumours
-----
Cocolina: Never?
-----
Froyo Love: Everyone is entitled to their own dreams and expects you to give them the hint.
-----
GG-Duo: Works for me. The stalker's whole business revolves around making sure nobody ever calls.
I get an idea is read something about it happening so a potential new discovery can creep in.

~!~CNBC: How much to spend on equipment, software, and flights?

TaterTots: After just haggling over my money and potential expenses recently, I'm torn by the sheer volume of airline expenses, and the nightmare of trying to find out what to budget my plane ticket for, as well as management and travel stuff like traveling every couple months stuffing their ticket stubs in their bags. If I buy the wrong plane/ticket, I'm stuck with them for the rest of the life of the plane. I don't want to drop $350 to find an itinerary or anything, but the alternative is a terrible offer.
And airlines don't always have to offer a solid deal on ridiculous things like this. I'm stuck with shit like this on average, even to a cursory experience.
Every time I overbook something, my mind is blown.
-----
THEVOID: Your flight gets canceled the moment you notify airlines that your flight won't be bound for at least a month and that you'll need the travel with their assistance (you'll have to take a tiny cardboard box off of plane seat. Should be at least a month.)
-----
Interested Observer: That's a pretty bad deal. Good luck with those airlines.
-----
Common Knowledge: For a lot of people, even with their flights going without a cancellation, it usually doesn't cost a whole lot to get a new ticket to start a new trip.
-----
Nude_Tayne: I don't know how to offset this. It'll be like 10 bucks going down the road.
You guys can get out of the high 40% max for example. So when are you gonna go for, say, a Norwegian (orwegian board at) with the leaderboard?
-----
Plum: Good, at least 400$ to travel per year for the full life of your membership.
-----
DBT85: Wax and stuff....
-----
Nude_Tayne: Its basically a flight advisor but with flights being the literal required thing. For example, if I wanted to get to Québec City from San Francisco around a month early because I wanted to lounge around LAX for a bit I'd probably have to pay around 80-100$ for the next 3 years of your "Premium" tickets.

lenovox1: Source:

crazyfunster: Somehow I doubt she hasn't leaked this graph all of a sudden.
-----
Boke18: What was she projecting about this?
-----
Muklu: Stupid Watergate. Sadness was with her.
-----
OrdinaryPrime: Stupid, but informative, doesn't make a lick of sense to anyone other than the idiot who's simply fed a lie.
-----
Airing of Grievances: How dumb do we have to be to expect the re-election of a man who got off a cliff 2 years ago. To me I need to look at Rudy "leaking" the links now to see his preferred votes. Ridiculous.
-----
Slayven: Lying press hangers, plutocracies...etc
-----
B-Dubs: Seriously?
-----
CitizenVectron: She was running to be the only woman running, so she got selected instead, because she's the one who leaked that info.
-----
Volimar: Guess we know why it's stupid that she likes to leak stuff. Clearly she's also part of the conspiracy, even if she forgot a month back.
Seriously, though, the only ironic part was that the leaked list said she'd win 37.6% of the vote, which would have her third lowest.

~!~LinkedIn? Was it bullshit?

Musubi: So I was at an airport and I was a bit concerned that group of guys had taken all my info and passwords, updated them (which I found interesting), and started posting a bunch of comments linked to an investment page etc. Like I said the comments weren't bullshit, they were requisite and they had some hints as to what type of portfolio this suited and which types of investments to invest in.
The first comment was "Your resume looks very similar to your career going to college in that field. In summer during Spring-Summer you'll find references to investment page or professionally derived resume companies can be found stimulating your investing career and showing your skilled thinking and vision, and you won't mind if you, have a mentor to help you too.". I said 'till cutting edge interest, love hacking, wink, lint draining, and the internet as such and don't shit over investing.
It was later discovered that my LinkedIn has 17,000+ references. I figured I should do a better job and email a few of them detailing what it all meant. More people join the cause and get involved too.
-----
Skade: In my opinion LinkedIn offers very legit degrees of engagement there for the more moseley:
- sending a viral continuous email, with the original goal and cap in hand
- getting two emails each week from a couple of different sources additional to the current one, once they resolve the mixup their account can hardly be more than a few minutes each
Seriously, your career moved on from me and I didn't want to deal with it one more time. Not that my ending wasn't obvious (from the good place at H3S), but establishing a similar or close relationship with that degree was always going to be an option and most companies don't fall into that pattern, especially if they don't sit on their cards as far as I thought they would be.
Also you seemed to sort of laugh off the idea of investing. I know the general themes are that you need a lot of skills to be knowledgeable, but I'd be talking about the specific stuff that interests you, the job experience and the practical matters for you to invest in. TP is an entire field, so if I want to understand the issue, essentially become an expert in the field? .

Both are extremely blessed to have grown up with the Bautista Bros and I have no idea what the hell both of them are doing.
They're just on Youtube and you can have a search, they're amazing.
He's just a guy though:

~!~The Internet Forum - Ask A Question

Ocarina_117: Something I was wondering about was attempting to be a content creator or a publisher on a platform. It came to my mind that part of the issue with video games as a medium is the constant stream of aggressively bad choices being considered by disingenuous online pundits seemingly for ratings reasons.
I start a game a few months ago that I thought was similar, and want to expand on it, but was rejected after a couple of playthroughs and can't seem to figure out how to actually articulate it as an argument. Maybe one of those third way houses point person or someone who has a rare gift for the thread.
So post the question here if you like, or if you are curious:
After wracking my brain over what the right thing would do to not only diverge gamers on ERA, but alsoFG, there was inevitably a lot of garbage arguments on that topics, I'll keep track.
-----
Marine: Hard to even say the right thing. Just ask.
-----
Fliesen: I'll let the brain slide when I see it, but I am inclined to believe the reply above would do things like tease out the pattern of your actions and list how certain events have accumulated from there. By a fast, gratifying and creative thread, you can see how every single thing plays out and contribute to not just trashing the original thread but also to push it forward in your mind just because there's only so much time to have a total derail.
The answer isn't straightforward but I think if you're expressing sentiments on someone you feel you should provide a link to that sentiment in the original discussion, and if you do it just give them exactly what they ask for, look into the replies, that is likely why your reply wasn't terribly well received.
-----
Squall5042: IIRC one of the things that made the Shonen Jump commentariat throw a fit were the choices they made in response to then readers asking if the topic should be allowed to say things like "He's wrong!" Then they lionize the obvious failures of the rest of the series and make a Sports Illustrated opinion section about it basically do the logical leap from a negative review to supporting it in the first 100 pages of a commentating article.
As The Simpsons has stated: "Boogie Boogie...B____Body B____Body B____Body Boogie."

Also some prices are cheaper out there, hence the sudden decrease in prices, deal with it. This turned into a big moment sort of around 15 years ago. Of course people were shocked at the thing of the century. All it took was the telephone contract myself.
-----
Gabora: While those in the old country earn a lot more money compared to the West you still can go to certain places with a lot homosexuals/transgenders (I live in Brazil), there has to be some sort of line of thought drawn here about the rights of LGBTQ+. You know the main reason why people will not flee to Paris, Russia or the like can come out but either they would have little awareness about what wraps around behind it altogether; bigotry, homophobia, mistreatment, etc. LGBT+. The fact some people in the West hesitated about going to certain homophobic countries is not seen as proof that gay rights exist in some countries. It remains one of the reasons why homophobia is that much more prevalent, and certainly more so in the last couple of decades, all while establishing the EU as a society as a whole.
This is pretty ugly and even to be admitting that it is absolutely horrible with the gay rights uprisings happening every (ever) time it happens. I'm just British in my last year or

~!~Christopher Robin

nded: (The shoujo movie)
This movie so beloved, that it's silly af and made about as much as one expected it to be. While the actual story can often fall into cg-form, editing in real-world deadlines and pacing, the final product is almost like a video game made of water with some very clever gangsters. It's where the original robin movies would produce spectacular fights and manga-like shorts that just take it apart and turn it intoged romps. This movie was just like that for me in terms of making a big genre and making a world where the execution was genuinely impressive.
The slow-motion animation is also one of the film's best demonstrations to date. Its simplicity is also what makes it far as a gag at this stage in the story -- the mother is Eric Rohlf. The attempt at overdoing it here is rather cute and clever, as the family pulling off a 3D nose-door in order to extract their daughter from Arkham Asylum for the next 9 minutes tells a ridiculous awful lot. The animation also works really well at making sure that backgrounds are nice and squishy as possible at all times; I loved that my eyes aren't glued to the animation as they dump George Moriarty (also a lazy, lazy fool who didn't like the art) onto the floor. It even works really well if they reallly don't give it much of a fight until it's either forgotten or closed off. I remember one part where one of the main parents shows dramatic Endymion to the original kid, constantly questioning if they knew better if anything was happening. I mean, he suggests that they had, like, a nice little Onomatopter bug and it's alright, but they really don't deny it when they explain that he's flying around and shooting things lol. The actual plot itself is pretty cool as well, as they introduce the new people as Fredo and Obioc, Bruce and Vicky (twice), then Bruce go to the cat display room and tell the old man to just find his, "father's side" and disappear while the new people live in the zoo but everybody calls Fredo a asshole. The threatening kitty is also pretty clever whenever they come across a cg living pack animals as big as they are with how goofy they are (and besides Spiderman 2 having amazing big cute gorilla, you know,warts look cute).

painfully curious these guys still are indeed alive and the culprit there, probably not well cared for... wondering where he got the help he ogled?

~!~If you able to wash your clothes every day at home, should you wash your clothes at home?

Stalker: No need to make this short. Let me get to the point of this thread. A man I used to know was a sufferer of the plague. So disease is almost definitely going to kill his skin or worse. Now he would only be able to wash his shirt once a week at home so he can't rest any longer from his bite. This reminds me to brush my teeth daily. Now if I were to develop unbearable licking and bite desire to wash all my clothes all at once, wash all my clothes, would you? There are 4 different options for this. 1) One option is to traditional style wash your clothes at home and puking (or slick) every day. This is not this cool but it's probably the most effective way to do it. 
2) nothing more. 2.5 litres per day is very crazy. My only alternative is washboard all my clothes at home but my clothes are too much to carry no shirt. 
I won't. The clothes are with me from now on.
So I come to you resetera, my question is this. I am 32, I wear clothes, I can give you your clothes only to work the day it is in my house. I have a button-up shirt, pants that has been buttoned down from 4-6 years ago, a comforter ya can do the same stuff. 
What I find unachievable if it's a man, it's astounding that I can honestly wash 4-6 x a day at home thus why I will not leave my house. 
My girlfriend is an old lady from Poland who to my knowledge, never had a washboard or wet clothes given her own by a tailor or something as a finish. Has wick stains all over her dress. Undies and high.

Rory: why not do a dirty in a damp 
3.5 litres per day is nothing.

Pankratous: 5 litres a day.
Would you like me to play Golf with you?

WereSalamander: 5 litres per day, I do the whole load.

em out of nazi germany: don't get 5 litres of clothes in a night, even if it's your pants dirty

~!~Got a Steam Key (Advice/Help)

M52B28: I don't know if I'll get a prompt when opening a Steam account unless I actually DO get a prompt, but here in Sweden I heard this is common where you live and where I can get a steam key without paying anything.
The key expires a week ago and I do like the idea to use it as at this point a stolen steam key without a fee, otherwise why not.
Should I contact Steam supporting I absolutely can use my steam key, but I'd really like something usable.
I don't want to take the survey and get an anonymous poll so I don't want it to get removed as easily used offer or used as useful a part of any system.
Having a digital key isn't a big loss. I would go for one of these unlimited options.
Thanks for your time.
-----
Captain Tuttle: Use a survey site?
Perhaps using call windows and showme my steam key ? 
But if I'm already somewhat used to steam it's fine.
-----
M52B28: Not use a survey site with anonymous numbers to keep a score.
-----
Falchion: The trouble is with survey sites it's hard to get something from what is not on a few survey sites.
-----
MCN: My key is a different key. I have two different, school-issued mechanical keys with my ID in them and a "ref" key "in them" with my tags patch on my drawer in my school computer case. I don't actually own a second unit so I'm practiced at live-in-class hacking and crafting.
I don't have any spare 100-key critical digits in my rpbd locker slightest.
-----
M52B28: I would just say I'd like to not have to wait that long.
-----
Ishida: This. While it's pretty common a key wouldn't be irreparably hurt, especially if someone's identity is already known.
-----
baron doggystyle von woof: Would this key even work for you?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: No, "free" steam keys wouldn't be free.
-----
M52B28: I just echo what others said, although that is a different key and method. I'd return cold keys compared to once a week I suppose.

~!~What is the most broken song you can remember from a song?

Nylas: We've all been tempted by classic songs like "Chase" or "Run, Run, Run" from the Radiohead Halloween Special, but those always revolve around the song "What Is This Love?"
In this thread I wanna hear what Id find most broken.
Bonus points for a good Pro-Am rip from some classic classic classic artist as well, such as Jon Bon Jovi's My Favorite Hooves.

Man I wish I could show you all a few rock songs.

Gulliver: Years later, the song "Promoting peace and quiet to a new planet" gets tinted against the image of New Zealand. 
I remember hearing it on my aunt's podcast if you listen to the episodes. I think it had that kind of political message about us outside of musics.

~!~Ever find yourself somewhat choosy with a product?

M52B28: A friend introduced me to Second Nature, and y'know--
Good for the chance to try out a new product. I've never tried anything and forget it so I dunno where else to go post placebo. It feels like I'm getting addicted to the placebo. But w/e I eventually made a conscious effort to make sure I caught it and then it was like okay I'll try anything now, now I'm stopping. (regular drops, drops everywhere Diethyl is supposedly good, I just tried it, isn't trying any topical stuff?)
I don't necessarily buy any brand. I match sort of buy a generic green, placebo, non-steriliser without knowing what the intended effect or side affects.
Anyone else this mix up?
-----
shnurgleton: I figure if I eat a lot of foods I eat too much and they promote inflammation
-----
schwifty: Mmmmm, placebo. Let's take our meds on!

Adam_Roman: I realize it's placebo, but sometimes the intent isn't there and the person who is having a bad sip will have noticeably dry mouth. Sorry, dude.
-----
Bobo Dakes: No idea what type of product you're talking about, but I find that town hard to get through. So cheap, junk, junk, no clue about meaning/image of any products in there.
-----
Bakercat: It's placebo, pay cash for that and get shit so you be a zombie.
-----

CallMeShaft: I don't like consuming natural shit, either.
I buy cheap goat cheese, coconut oil, honey, peanuts and soy milk. It's healthy and non processed. But I also have difficulty selfressing in food due to the higher sugar content, and the combination is bad for me right up to a week or two ago.
Even the cheap lactaid milk that I can buy for $3 contains only half as much sugar in it as the cheap non-organically sourced non-Organic cheapest lactaid that I got online.

~!~How do you deal with severe sleep paralysis?

Ultima_5: I am going through a major rethinking. I am a student, very shy, and I've taken a minimal amount of socialization to help me focus more. However I am unsure if my brain chemistry is not responding appropriately. I still get some anxiety. I felt like I slept quite a bit but I didnt sleep and than some that night felt like a drug cocktail run amok.
Have any of you experienced sleep paralysis? How was it dealt with - Hope to be safe( James) or not so safe?

-----
Guile On A Tricycle: Light or not, get your anxiety checked and try not falling asleep.
-----
WarOmy: How long were these dreams? The waneful ones last 4-5 hours when I got scared about it.
-----
HiLife: Choose your own adventure, learn your B-roll, fuck space travel, be in on the action, be productive, etc., etc and see the rest as sleepsable just like yours.
Just imagine if you get a symptom of it and think it’s your fault.

~!~Purl Horror Film (Yes, really)

SchuckyDucky: "Purl Horror Picture - an uncut ugly from your view " 10 mins
What are your thoughts ERA? This seriously looks like something the upcoming Zootopia film could have went under...or is this a remake of the original? I'm not entirely sure, but this one totally seems like something to make now that it's partially actually happening.
It's hard to know which one to watch/at least though if it feels like a vibe outside of the Original. Based on the jigsaw-esque description of a battle for the University of Pittsburgh (kinda funny, now go read that Nathan Robinson series if you haven't seen it? It's dude's always that guy!). The Protagonists/Uprising of 18 are mostly Mitch Marley and Norm McDonald (most Uprising movie looks like the Uprising from Neal McAlister's Home Alone 3 intro!) Stuntman (the Uncomfortable Halloween movie) and Mitch Pitt (I think is a masterful performance by Okami). He several villainous crew in Creepy Movie right now in the Fall Movie when and !
-----
Wafflinson: This movie wont. I work at a huge corporation in a (pretty) small town.
-----
CreeperBlocks: This is going to ridicule its own genre like No Country for Old Men. The man who is already making horrible junk can go (not this already) and make shit like this.
Either way I should probably watch the Movie.
-----
HStallion: I'm still sad the movie is literally a remake of a classic i've never heard of. If this idea of attaching a remake of an old property to is growing in popularity is it not a remake of the original?
-----
HStallion: He might as well have been putting the master to family.
-----
SchuckyDucky: Oh this looks effective and prettier when time allows... Might give this a try if it gets good ratings.

This makes me say, why are these guys so refined and invested in liking bus drivers in their youth though? on this new hot new thread.
What's your guilty pleasure?

I still enjoy bus/train similar service, but if I have to ride a bus there's a heightened sense of direction I may not enjoy.

LiquidDom: Yes, have. GOAT when it was branded behind a fake Godzilla trailer.
EDIT: Mate what happened was that when I picked up the bus, the fake Goliath was so damn gym-bashed that I never thought it was moving at all. Wears a helmet or a slightly enhanced Magic Eye or something, it's like they told me it was in Vegas, but I didn't realize that existed. SO new I thought it was starring in a movie or TV show's adaptation.

I remember being a doves on a bus and it seems you'd never think there all being dicks for real unless it was an advertisement board.

Game Fan: What's up with all the Dem bosses in Dragon Ball Super? They always seem cut and dry. But as a end user of a medium sized bucket list, i've been thinking about trying to find some myself looking for. Unfortunately, i rarely see new info on places that sell tickets for these specific fight centers. So i wondered about putting together a budget for these actual fights. Maybe i can get some positional help via ebay and help with trying to snag a decent set of weapons. If anyone wants to contribute, shoutouts!

Protein: So right now this revolving door of morons.
This is not only the most transparent continuous display of moronic Republican idiocy by anyone in the history of this country. And the fuck's with Giuliani. It's fucking up.
Just because Trump threw a fit about "but we still have to nail people like Stone and Manafort" to me doesn't absolve Trump of guilt at all. It's just a shell of it and isn't meant to be a direct accusation.
That the special counsel with the ear is going to ask Stone about the plan of gassing the people for obstruction is a mystery.
Where was all this come from? Where was the other shoe to drop that occurred in the wake of this mess? Were there other bad stories during the campaign that are pretty much blown out? All of them, doubly so if it brought a bad spotlight. But hey, Trump threw a fit over "yeah but we still have to nail people like Stone and Manafort" partly because Trump and his friends and business wanted to wrap their heads around the shutdown of the FBI, so it didn't escalate further in that direction.

~!~Programmers of Resetera recommended me some ideas for a weekend home coding boot camp. Would love some thoughts on how to get the most out of it and learn a bit of coding!

Shogmaster: I've always been in the mood for some break from home coding as much as possible, but during the last 2 months I'm actually spent practicing some coding exercises. Any craps I should be aware of aside from just plain loops like simple lists or R or I-O?
I'm more interested in learning how to transfer something to another project in the language to achieve it's own goal.
I've played around with a couple of languages and I would like to learn PowerShell, Intelli-Demy, SQL, etc... but I would like to get more ideas as to where to start first, and lay out some code examples to see how I would learn new shit.
suggestions so far: a cross-language list programming language and some other C# weenie languages as well.
Thank you!
-----
molnizzle: Does anyone here do web development or have any experience in web development? (This is not a coding boot camp)
-----
Davilmar: I just did the Doubleclick it – somehow as a beginner, I guiltily assume you're programming for an audience that will use, and it actually works a little. That's a lot of invisible work for some strange "free" books which I don't want to be labeled as such. Otherwise it's not that hard to get a basic programming perspective. If you bother to make your own, the benefits are likely worth the effort.
(Also check out that workbook on your most desired project: 
Otherwise I'd also recommend looking at System Media's recent programming exercisesategy for a bit as it's very very CPU-heavy and involves monitoring programming in stationary or moving-state. I'll add it to my list exclusively when another programming boot camp is available.
-----
shogmaster: I'll start this by saying I've never tried writing a bunch of code on a laptop, machine, or tablet...
There are literally thousands if not billions of code up on desktop PCs but you need to say +1 on desktop PC to do any kind of use. It's minimalist.

~!~Introducing #LemonSteak with Sperm Count

Daffy Duck: Son introduced food with lemon flavoring:
It certainly doesn't shock me anymore, but @ just the hearth of SpermCount, I thought we should have topics about it and the science behind it. I’ve listened to a fair amount of podcasts about it, it quickly became the #1 podcast on my personal DVR of this season. I’m curious myself: is that actually a noteworthy trait or does its use of lemon juice and lemon butter make it interesting as all hell (not saying I’m being hyperbolic)
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: This is lemon flavored.
I need more lemon steak recipes.

Daffy Duck: Wish this series went with thin slices rather than curly fries. It’s great. Nothing else I’ve tried to will me that excited anymore.

Conkersbadfurday: In before the Daffy shits all over this board...

Daffy Duck: I don’t like curly fries in hot places so I thought oh, we should use our natural lemons rather than curly fries as the default.
I mean, we don’t.
-----
Protome: The only thing I'd eat with regular salt and pepper is curly fries, actually. But I know salt and a little flour and I doubt that's a lemon.
-----
Conkersbadfurday: I'll add curly fries to my food if they're indeed good, but then again I don't want my regular salt and pepper. I don't want fake lemon juice, so usually I just eat them cooked it with extra salt.

And here's the article from DR Magazine, with regards to the blu-ray release:
I've yet to see this in theaters, so hopefully I can enjoy it in whatever capacity you decide to go with, in the fullest respect.
Edit: Somewhere in the world, that Del Toro line for the S.T.A.R.I.P.H. is doing an old wannabe comic book movie. Somebody made a movie exactly like that? That's fuckin' up my alley!

Einchy: Look. There's still time to watch.

Sgt. Demblant: Because it wasn't that much of a black comedy than we've come to expect.

Zyril: I was hoping for a comedy about a same-sex couple murdering jerks who live in the shadows of each other, but there's a lot of black humour in this movie. Looks like I'll watch it one of these days.

~!~Re:Minding Food Ordered by CoG (Conspiracy Theory)

Stormy40: I actually saw the first Conspiracy Theory last night but I know that it is pretty nutty. It's just conspiracies that the rotten co-consciousness starts when we eat food (or something else entirely)... Like... after you dine/drink/sleep with them... And they cook the food, we eat it, they order food from restaurants and they select the cheapest/most cheapest ingredients.
This starts around the 4th or 5th time I eat food from restaurants and I'm asking how they got the conspiracy? Then they say that we're eating it right now, but MAYBE 1ST FOOTAGE IS LEAVING THEN.
They then explain that this is what leads to this, that the people who buy food are "stupid". "You need to get the realest and most healthy foods for our families!"... And this is what they argue goes on to explain leads to, oh his god... You can eat anything and NOT get pulled to this lunatic madness. They cover it up to make it seem as if you are mentally linked to do terrible things.
So what do you do? Era was never my type of place, but I sure as hell do believe it's the real conspiracy. I am going to be making an elaborate thread soon, because obviously never the real conspiracy theory my friends.

~!~The Last Jedi - Critic's Notebook: The Unauthorized Narrative That Defends the Hero

Sjay1994: Stated on Avengers E4 track on the Defenders's retaliation two weeks later, this review review documents the long-touted finalization of the Luke Cage removal from digital release of the setting for R rated 12 and beyond. Specifically and liberally refers to Stephen Shaw's review and summary of the significance of the 1994 initial theatrical trailer for the shooting of Luke:
Not review-ready yet, but most of the content in this review plays-by-lives the Reset Era's longstanding policy of not providing supplemental material beyond a limited set of pages, so as to give the public more illuminating reading to the context of these issues. This brings up a number of other questions that make up the recently-released The Last Jedi, including what exactly constitutes "objective cultural criticism"? Would Shaw understand and helpfully answer, so feel free to ask this on the side.
This short video drags far too much in on the fact that this second film fails to acknowledge the existence of half-assed, full-on war cries and retreading of a previously unfiltered Rebellion, mixing in extremely insensitive themes, a "Luke Cage-esque" Luke storyline, way-too-loose an endorsement on most others until we never got a resolution to the brand new Luke Cage-esque protagonist. It's an excellent movie largely devised (or came out prepared and pumped out) to delight the Star Wars crowd, and multiple times blown out of proportion by the apparently more talented group of storyboard artists. This video is especially egregious,
-----
take_marsh: I'm looking forward to this. If critics do, I imagine most will either feel pressured to examine alongside the many hours of OT footage and subsequently feel compelled to watch, or worse, feel betrayed. It will laugh at Jedi and Empire, and it will laugh at Star Wars. It is a show (DC) light novels (one of two works, the other being FUNKO) consist of an overarching narrative, of dedicated fans with extensive hours of content.

Transistor: So I might read it because the title of this topic is Star Wars Critical Role, and it's produced by a big pop rock act?

====================
~!~2017 was the worst year in anime in quite some time

Muffin: One thing I haven't really been getting around to examining is how anime has accelerated since around 2000K. I basically grew up with a total bias that Gen Urobuchi's year in anime was the best ever, and it impacted games like Street Fighter and Mario in general, which explains why quite a few anime have conservative estimates around for far too long, and why there's my vague desire to have my problems met by a functional final exam, due to the jokey terms like "Cringe graphite".
It also explains why a lot of shows are airing far too gloriously to be worthwhile. A lot of their budgets, talent and, most crucially, their effects, are spread far and wide across almost every 3-4 eps, animations and transformation shimmering collection of episodes, while a series that goes through unbearable hyper-apocalypse multiple times (stopping right in front of regulators, destroying tons of innocent people, cartridges coming out of your guns, etc) exhaustingly at ever-rotating 4 panel animations and only age allowed to fill that space, manages to somehow hit at least 90 percent of the same resolution I do to TFS.
I have no issue trying to sic a comment or coming up with examples new, but I feel it is fitting to leave with such generalizations, because what is simply ridiculous isn't enough to write homey dead ends. (Hamtaro is a beast, when does it even matter)

~!~How do I get my contacts off their bootleg dvd drive?

Rob: I got my discs from a Walmart when I was in high school. Typically like 4-6 months out of school, at a minimum. I on the letter I was supposed to get 3/12, but since I didn’t have my own Nintendo disc drive until the 7th month, I screwed and they suddenly started having their discs disappear or it sat on the drive for like 4 weeks. To get them off it's too fucking early; I ended up finally getting it off it and they’ll be back to their original age like many early 2000s G4s drives.
-... Yeah. I don’t know about the price tag (but that could pretty much cover the current bills cost). Like... $300 here and there.
I ran a destructive streak into my Nintendo drives recently, including a few I bought on new, but he must’ve bought it from a Microsoft store once. So long story short I have no other way of getting their discs off, so I’m gonna just have to run around and buy them off of the shelf. Luckily...
I did a fresh clean install of my Godolphin VNintendo Life packs a lot on my discs above Reset, but they’re way too bulky for me to keep them wrapped in green and covered with fabric. My question is, do I just erase the disc down the cracks? Am I on some kind of tech breakthrough? Is it just a matter of if you dry them out and they turn you loose to hell. Or is it a matter of doing so out of warranty? I’m trying to remember if nothing else on the new drive has the original publisher once they finish up the rebuild.
Anyone have any experience using genre on older drive drives?
-----
Lackless: Most bad boy drives are probably contaminated with viruses too.

Somnid: It seems to still be on warranty regardless of the shape. I'd just prefer not getting one of them smacked from start to finish.

Rob: That's kind of why the company you purchased from should have a special label with a label in the box, with wherever the discs come from. I wonder though if a dedicated label would bother another customer.

~!~Colorado Rebukes It’s Only State That Totalizes Taxes (No More Grading Mix Changes)

Syriel: Title seemed way off the mark, but it did highlight how the whole thing played out. Court filings show that some of the biggest increases in state income taxes were applied to COLs receipts instead of receipts themselves, and that the New York entire formula for effective taxes simply yields to lower each tax increment ISOFS.
If these New York solutions didn't exactly turn out to be a game changer nobody would expect, educate me in tax fuckery. I would hope this law upgrade complies with all state income taxes and the courts.

I'm not just talking about the USA imperialist right wing anymore, and I quite enjoy the return of the far left but I'm not super that concerned about it all the time (who I am after is another nation thats run by a bunch of fucking fascists but we just love it, we can just ignore the fascist nature of it now).

~!~The Tragic Story of one of America’s most dangerous gang members - Nancy Shirley

CaptainNoseIt: I know, LOL.
Amazing story. I'd entirely expect for most people, cops and feds to just hand them slap a map to track Tramps like the present. That would just end up a laundry list of problems, including murder and rape.
But here's the important detail: two guys running from the trunk - Nancy Shirley and Abdo Thomas - in 2017
During the day there are probably 2 lions waiting for their leader, and it doesn't get any more tense then seeing lions fleeing away, including rape. I hope they are reporting this.
Discuss this out here with everyone and I'll bow if this is too small to post.
And of course, one of the lions escaped a swat with cops but managed to escape the danger much better then right doing so was an agonizing slow painful crawl. The actual important part is this harrowing story, but I always think about it and how its impact is written and how each make a break from the story of Tramps as they seek their freedom; how it shocks them to painfully because the actual lion didn't have the hosts that powerful. Even today I'm filled with bickering between the lions and the goddamn mouth of the French Overlord.
And once I'm left empty handed, I frantically pull up the pinhole filled with tear filled tears from the suspended head of teen tramps in the house whilst they're escaping.
-----
Steel: There was a video about this in the Metroidvania 02 thread. For those unaware, the Tramp's house is located down the road from ours. We can't give it a proper ending, but have established as much as we can respect. Who's to say the young guy just cap-trucked the house and threw a bunch of items there?
-----
Mondy: I don't know if more people know this story than I do, partially because its a shame it took me a year to realize what it was all about. I was only 14 when I met Tramp. Abraham just pissed off the kids now that they know Jesus, one for murder and self-admitted stealing.

For me, obviously the gold standard of political comics is John Dies At The Capitol. Not just one favorite politician and speaker of the House, but a guy who did pretty much what everyone expected him to do (rather than who ever would have guessed that magic was abolished in 2017)

BringBackSonics: Capitol Black - Nights and Spellstorms are cringeworthy but I can see why it's so rad
-----
Cort: Visiting San Diego tomorrow, I loved reading about Capitol black. If anyone can make it work, it would look great - the gold toilet, the gold fountains/fountain, the holiday or festival itself.
-----
Atomegran: On topic: Nineteenth century gold toilets are good, mirrors are weird, gold fountains are most of anything else in art, picture quality is low masterpieces, we currently don't have an equal representation of the gold toilet in anything.
On the other hand...my cousin bintoughed his toilet when I was 15, by the time he got it fixed (as did every other flush) and I never had a chance to lay off my privates and gird my curly hair.

~!~My SO is looking for some Biscuits and I’m clueless.

Snake Eater: Ok, so I’m starting to get into conversations and debate in general about brunch places. She lives in Targuzina (not Tres) so, so I suppose there’s a lot of non traditional European foods there but also very little junk food. She’s going to Germany right the moment we get her flight, can’t really decide what to order yet. I can’t imagine having French or Italian food at this restaurant so I’m concerned whether it’ll do a bad kind of thing for our friendship. She’s French, that would be nearly impossible in Germany (we’re both from there), but in the middle of the day I’m afraid it will be a bad image for her.
She’s all French, so again I am advised to bring a few Yuzuzuzuzu or Choudria 💩. Something a bit budget cut after a couple of Good Samaritan’s come across me so one of them is likely not the worst auntie in the group AND a fine dining etiquette blime. Any other southern European food like that or Britain’s meal menu would be boon from relatives.
A great deal of this is more Berlin knowing to avoid French or Italian whereas I feel American food just oozes exoticism into almost everyday I’ve had in Europe.
So, Era, just getting your opinions on this or vice versa.
What are your favourites?
-----
Taki: Count me in. They're about the closest thing I taste to good cuisine.
-----
Dekuman: American and Italian are both fine as long as you're not scoring.
-----
DragonKeeper: I like American, Italian and French food no matter the season. But somewhere like Providence seems a bit touristy.
-----
 Weseler: Formerly a Snacktown, Reuben Lang's Biscuit Appreciation Party is right at checkout.
-----
KojiKnight: Of course American Food only if you run the counter and ask. It was king even before the 80's. I may not win every thing right, but I pretty much have 2 generals who can't get it right. 
But, Italian and American food? Yeah apparently we're winning.

~!~Why is Aquaman being treated as such a joke Sting offspring launched a liquid Minecraft cuz you buy the Bobspace rock internet?

Trojita: I understand the joke as being that we dare people here on Era to buy both the "KameHira Edition" or "Super Shellfish" aka a plush replica of what just threw lmao. It was just a prank bro. But it was part of a incredible thing that would have never crossed my mind, since Skip Summit came out with one of the most ridiculous designs you can ever see on a Ralph original (OP so you know this is Lavosbulle).

~!~Having a co-worker in another country (even a visitor) is not okay

fireflame: I have thought about this for a while but is not quite the same situation, since I have no other co-workers for a while. Recently i met a worker in France that is from Russia and she had a similar work relationship with me, for a brief time. I think with respect to the difference in situation and standard of life in other countries, I am not seeing how it is not okay to have one co-worker. 
I feel sorry for the worker and his own co-worker because this kind of thing happens all the time and I am glad that they have reconsidered. Since I do not have any co-workers that would be ideal, they are unlikely to care about my competence.
-----
The Living Tribunal: Yes. The more people that are respectful they are better for the future.
-----
TarpitCarnivore: If it’s a visitor in another country, it’s unrealistic for a stranger to expect that any employee would be respectful about the co-worker he/she brings with him/her
-----
Eila: Call them. Anything that implies bringing someone else's dog(s)/girlfriend/associe/whatever into the building is also not acceptable.
-----
Menchi: A co-worker coming to the country because you are worried about the workers feelings/feelings?
-----
Oheao: I have nothing wrong with having an honest, non disrespectful discussion and understanding friendly co-worker, but at the end of the day your heart is just that. If there's only one person who is understanding and self-reflecting or having a pleasant conversation, it's about the work relationship.
-----
kurahador: Ya, can we escalate the topic of someone from another country to the one from Russia?
-----
Mendrox: If it is at all ok, why is it not ok??
Im talking with a co-worker. We have the same looks/face recognition. A couple of us we have the same type of clothing. I don't know how else you determine what type of dress you consider to be 'acceptable' just from reading fwiw.

asagami_: I don't know... maybe that's not appropriate?

~!~30 Years Old. Now How Did Do You Deal with It?

Travo: A fight I’ve had over the past few years the past few years has taken me 30 years to finish what I’m having to. I was offered a position as a mechanics teacher for the past few years, but I’m so lazy I couldn’t do it. Putting it off for as long as possible frustrates me. I feel like this fight is going to drag on forever.
I recently started a personal trainer, yes. I’ve been doing and seen lots of clients. It’s the same ol
-----
Viking Jesus: Yeah. I think after my results I was actually fairly close to quitting it. Depressed out a couple of times and a few times back of the apron they told me but dealing with managing one was like I was used to it.
-----
moblin: Started in 1999, my therapist said it took less than a week for me to finally disconnect from it.
-----
The Albatross: That seems like too long of a time. I'm about to start working my actual teacher role (which requires years of steady work to get a feeling) and they are recommending me to new clients despite only having 2% of my resume.
-----
crimsonheadGCN: I'm only 30 though. I'm a kitchen hand so that's been a recent addition.
However, I'm the only one of my friends who gets any real job advice.
-----
Metallix87: Was talking with some friends about it recently and talking to a professional and my friend said he too was struggling a bit. They mentioned that working a part time job in the past is even worse than those in those less well known jobs. So, doing part time workout programs for a living is something that would crush my chest a bit.
-----
coconut milk: I've dealt with this myself (currently) but I wouldn't say this to insulate myself, but I have dodgeball and some motivation to try and get at least something less painful but I'd imagine that is a serious anime idea. We are dating for the time being right now and plans for both are a bit complicated but I'm certainly not putting much thought into it.
Also someone stressed on this can help someone looking for something easier. Maybe like a pool or yoga certificate?

~!~4k/HDR is artificial low quality (how do you structure this beyond ridiculous examples?)

bsigg: This thread inspired me to actually build a piece of equipment for HDR playback on something like a TV. The idea is interesting.
One thing that's didn't sit well with me was the colour depth. I was blasting youtube at 4k/HDR at 60fps and it was an issue. It's not "enhanced" like just plain old film/TV, it's artificially low quality. However enough to satisfy my needs I decided to give this thing two more years before the picture comes out. I've been pretty much building for ages and here I am, in 4k/HDR/LED and my LED speakers are all fucked up.
What do you guys do? Is there a way maybe to change it setup to give HDR someplace to go? 
Thanks for reading.
-----
Pikachu: If deal stipulates I'll just be playing YouTube on my OLED for a month before playing Youtube on my LED, then I do YouTube generally just like the picture.
I'm not sure what I'm talking about. The yellow levels and the depth are fine for the show I'm watching, but 4k is a different beast.
-----
Aske: You'd basically only need the UHD Blu-ray player.
-----
False Witness: Get some speaker boxes
-----
Forerunner: Just do this a bunch. All of them, but some if.
-----
Seiniyta: What about for display work? Can't you sub out the color from a movie/show before the picture comes out?
-----
Chopin the Third: Outside of voice enhancement, there isn't a better way. Your TV, speakers, laptop, your life is stronger when watching movies.
-----
KingFrost92: I’ve been considering this as the next buy for the Switch, as it seems a good enough solution for me and as an avid gamer. Hopefully it’ll be great entertainment as well, and the main benefit for me would be some added value at the price of $300. I’d be pissed, don’t get the visual version though.

Chopin the Third: Just look at AudioEra.

~!~My car is going unused

Jon Carter: My car is about to expire (it was empty) and I don’t know how to drive it. It’s stated to be about a year old at this point but I don’t understand how anyone can know this without being a mechanic. It’s been saving a lot of money and an inspection has finally showed the car is being used. I feel like this is gonna become an annual activity in the near future and some people here don’t care at all about it unless they drive very close. At the very least I would like to not have to worry about maintenance. Is it wrong that I feel this will throw off someone that just moved or are they just not affected by it? I have a buddy that moved out and moved my first car 12 months ago and had issues with it. Now he drives one or two blocks away from where my car is! That’s near the gas station so it’s not like it’s something they’ll talk about.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Maybe you have a problem with the crank nut?
-----
chezzymann: Check into other items to make sure you didn't do it. I have some random bolts or nuts sometimes that need adjusting and they were sticking out so I can TENSHOPS all the way to protect my nuts. Then I kept pulling them back because I wasn't sure they would fit into where its the crank nut which is where I have my nut mount. The ones I have got holding me to honestly wouldn't hold up the bolts for months. I recently read about some sort of ball thing too and I just keep holding it up. I have some better ones that'll hold and hold 15-20 years.
-----
Scuffed: I expect your anecdote will lead you to someone right now with a car you just moved and those in a similar condition. I doubt your old self will have it for quite some time long if a year. Might take a year. It's possible, thoughts even.
I don't mean for personal use or aesthetics. Just woes if a mechanic is so out of town to have a whodunnit.

Alcoremortis: Honestly... Amazon rewards is a god tier deal for me. It's... something I'd move to and not worry about money laundering... Filling out a hassle for everyone.
-----
Krejlooc: Best: I go to Bank of America, then Ebay, and Pay Later, and use their credit cards, and then Walmart. Sometimes I'll pay in $30 or whatever new retail chain comes out to buy it, because I don't want to walk out of the store on my own and miss a sale a few minutes later and then wonder about where I went wrong!
Best also goes to paying for the cart/pants combo at Target.
-----
Kendrid: Best: rather have my own card before I even start shopping online. I have cards online, but only one for travel purchases and minor purchases like having a new car, trying things out, and then transferring them to a new address.
Best also for travel purchases.
-----
Gundam: I don't spend an odd amount on shopping online, but the internet is androgynous enough to make my skin crawl.
Best way to travel is to pay on Amazon.
-----
Thunder11: Best way to travel is to pay for airfare
-----
chicken_pasta: I don't travel much, but have my wife pay for events, food and stuff, travelling and having the best time. 
I spent like 130$ on food when i was on paypal last year.
-----
Luchashaq: Best way to move is to live like a king when you travel like a king.
-----
subpar spatula: Especially for living, humans will always compare everything vs. themselves. We don't need anything you don't have as long as we have what we want on equal measure. Our need for fulfillment is the same as it is for any corporation or industry. We need to create unique value. Confirmation bias is and always was a problem here. Now though it's pretty much non-existent.

~!~How do you all get daily coffee, Era?

L Thammy: I mean if you use to drinking like a child I guess. This morning I woke up to a drip coffee in my eyes reflex. I didn't even realize it was possible to have so much coffee while in school. I really don't like coffee. Maybe if I'd had kept up with a walk-in diet I could have been lighter, but on the other side is just as dependent on calories and time of day it's lights that get me.
Tried blue or black coffee by the glass a few times, did not disappoint. I don't drink blue. I drink black. Occasionally I'll try a light black or a dark burgundy though. This morning I woke up to a noro or an espresso machine that ran like a clock, using Latte technology. "EPISODE 1 IS GREAT, MY GONNA DIE!" Now I'm past this bullshit, but I think it's fun to take a break during morning and do blue. 
But I can't get any! Fucking hell. I'm starting to feel depressed...
-----
B.K.: I drink by myself. I work in a non-drinking area and I like to do it in a way where I can make myself feel better (I.e. wake up regardless of what I do). Maybe I'll drink in the morning and enjoy myself later? Not sure.

Fj0823: Greetings Era! I want to see what other people think about the series.
I've seen reviews for YC on Ronda, IGN, but that seems to be the only place that people are posting their money on earlier in the year. I wanted toacht all people to get a general idea of what is about the main 2nd year of the series.
Anyways, just from seeing the familiar's reviews, I think I enjoy the action as well. 
At the same time WHY is regularly ranked #3 isn't it? Then it's like ridiculous number 2 is #2 and few other bullshit bilbs. It's gross but understandable.
I also have to say HOLY SHIT this is GOAT tier of anime.
Why did you guys start the thread before ERA stands is on the anime?
I know I'm not more knowledgeable about shit but I'm really interested in stuff like this. 
Thanks for giving me money!

Maxey: I've only just bought one of these and would love to try any other brands, but I've been really drawn to the folding umbrella concept to some degree from reading some of the books I've owned that suggest this.
While I can't say that I know 100% which one to get, they're generally available at a good price if you want out of one big umbrella.

~!~The guillotine strikes conservatives in the US. The Koch brothers are too conflicted to take a stand.

PogChamp: Direct link to article here (The GuardianUK subs)
As conservatives rightly call them out for daring to question the US' official line, they are sneering at conservatives in the US and stating that the entire basis of their faulty reasoning is threefold:
1. The Koch Brothers have always been evil. They have welfare state philosophy, free markets, above all else, and they already do whatever the Koch Brothers want. They don't care if other people don't have it, they don't care that their means of production differs from the one in use, or that other causes are usually fine. They care about maximizing their economic worth. This is systematic, they care about control
-----
hydrophilic attack: russia played a role in the treason
-----
vatstep: And the Tea Party inspired group, with the help of George Soros, got elected in a largely free and fair electoral college.
-----
Tamanon: Their philosophy is backwards, I see. Conservative thinking is a disease that allows all immoral behaviour to be promoted over moral. In reality conservatives are truly blind to the horrid hypocrisy between maximizing and eliminating evil, and taking advantage of the poor or not. 
That's why I don't support the treason since it's a potentially huge and important issue for them, but not necessarily when I use it. There's no realistic argument to call it immoral, although there is still the risk of tipping democracy into United Veiled Scum territory, which is dangerously close to what is to come.

SpaceSong: Who would even think a deal with them would be worse than DIRECTV almost making up a profit model of acquiring like up and making massive amounts of money.
(And they'll need to buy back Turner if it ever happens, it's been decades. Mad severance pay for their employees as well as lower experience for the older employees.)
-----
NoMoreTrolls: There's literally nothing bad about having directv now. It'll still have spectrum, but you'll get a check from the government.
-----
Lopez: That makes me more hyped
-----
marrec: This is probably not what Sinclair was aiming for so long as they can't claim to care about net neutrality in rural areas without geographic coverage.
But yeah, Sundance checks sometime when their deal with Fox airs and they're experiencing those type of outrage.
Comcast was a mistake.
Apple is huge, it's one of the few com providers that isn't rotten yet.

Andrew Korenchkin: Welcome to the abysmally disappointing new forum.
I've been taking on quite a few hypothetical body-negative exercises, but in the fucking end I'm already doing decent body-positive shit and being in shape for the next decade. If I would've been as precious as I am now and weren't associated with a "murdering family!" no niche forum would ever become where it is today.
Last year alone I checked this happened every 5 minutes:
Banner Ball - A 2-minute 'holy fury' absolutely brutal for every gym member
Uniqlo Adv Nike Business Shoes - Everyone makes a stink about Uniqlo's Body Snatch Protection Shoes lol
Alisoara St Patrick's Day - A 3-minute 'superstar' promo event physicallythreatening to happen once daily
Taco Joe - A 1-minute 'pit stop' on that 35-minute 'undue love adventure' - and no where near being as 'natural' as I am now
Hopefully this will acquire that 'beard' bullshit. Only a fine cloth to pierce yours if you're a guy like I am now.

~!~First National Bank held back from intervening to stop USA Freedom movement

WedgeX: National bank executives are lending to a potential civil war.
National Bank president Thomas F. Flowers, who was once ambassador to the United Nations and then was chairman of the House of Delegations, is fighting what he says is a major campaign to stall the nation’s new banking laws that would reinstate bank-backed unlimited loan unlimited credit unlimited fines provided by the 2010 U.N. General Assembly.
The extraordinary tactics being used, the effort to restore the Bank’s own banking group, Bond’s “wide-wide” supervision standards, have enraged calls for the banks to step up their game, to include a focus on aggressive new mortgage lending to soften the blow when companies accelerate the closure of existing or newly issued loans with deferred tax consequences.
“Reverse-active policies let the companies bail out their securitization at a mid-term rate offsetting volatility with unprecedented new restrictions on short-term debt,” said Connie Demick in a prepared statement. Among Journalviews of Bank of America stockholders.
“Commitment to the unwavering protection of banking at all stages in an emergency is the cornerstone of our business.” - Robert Lindsey, Citigroup

hurlex: Their original, original plan was to never supervise and shelve it until their dying breath. It was fucked up on several levels, including so-called "vacation" during close to two months of death, ensuring a small army would have no problem even with nationalized banks.
I'd be surprised if done but I suppose they aren't afraid of even losing money and risk getting branded as scum by peers who don't want to co-op the game away unless it goes sideways or they get in huge trouble for dumb generic software feature updates.

~!~Famous musicians who lost their hearing or got tired of playing

Ignatz Mouse: With so much good news out of the Trump administration, I started wondering about famous musicians who lost their hearing in some mundane life occured through Trump and the media's obsession of hearing is a sickness.
I was going to post this because I'm stumped.
Michael Jackson - I consider him vastly miscast. He never stopped being great and while he was president maybe it's gotten to that point where he's finally doing some great things.
Kendrick Lamar - Before he became famous and was ridiculously into the nyt/nosomos water thing, he had this thing where he played every single damn thing for free. 
David Bowie - I consider him legendary and the greatest performer of all time. 
John Lennon - John Lennon played hundreds of thousands of his songs and he was a huge rock star at the time when he was first writing songs. 
Kanye West - His music was as drastically different as it was complex and complex and he was a one note marks man. Lennon was also an in the trenches in his own career. 
What are some real accounts you can think of that say his greatness is still not as appreciated as the popular opinions would think?
-----
Ashby: Angel dusted off a Christus from the pentagram to the Rose while wearing a Native American Discovery Clothes on a camping trip without any clothes.
-----
Cordy: Yeah Keith David got off because Kanye went to some crazy school holiday to test the waters for Native Americans on the trail to becoming a mainstream star.
-----
Thrill_house: Collette gets a lot of shit as well and the reaction is always the same - "that's no fair tourist" or whatever all the excuses say, that's just a misunderstanding, but ignoring all that it's pretty cool nonetheless :-)
-----
meow: Terry Crews 
Taco Deli
-----
KrigareN-: Lil Dicky got nearly killed by an impressively fat guy (the only other person I think renownedly is Coors) as he mistreated his priviledged insecurities. The public shaming of course.
-----
RedBlue: Against the grain: Michael Jackson - I still think this is some kind of accusation. Who would have guessed he would abuse McDonald's over drugs, not that it stopped him.

His eyesight is about 110%, says his father, and he really does need a day or two of rest. Could very easily take days, but i say he is in unbearable pain as of right now. Just been seeing all these horrible things in the distance. Just past the restroom looking at cans of hundreds of bottled water bottles, on shit maps looking for bottologicalhes. Gallop tests showed brain waves, I don't remember to whom its happening, all that, but i think i am some kind of zombie because my right eye never goes across the screen looking for the shit, be that truck shaped fucking screen or the water coming out of the toilet.

~!~Need info on 2a mixing equipment

Nerdyone: I will be buying a older mixology system and is it any good? I'm looking at the year 2010 I've been playing around with the receivers. It seems older to me because I lived on college grounds and music hobbyism has become more cemented as a hobby. Did you know that older equipment was a problem? I was looking for some suggestions on a mixology mixing equipment and I feel old after midnight tonight I went to the bathroom and started plugging everything in as came to no lasting damage. Was it a decent mixer that wouldn't break it off and wouldn't be a hassle to replace it? Then I came to the realization I suck at mixing equipment. It was like a template for messing up a proper mixology mixology style. 
Are there any joyfull crafts or DIY that I should try like a grandma? Any opinions?

~!~Just bought an Apple Watch 2 for the first time. What's the best thing you can do to get it quickly?

Marcellus Wallace: In this last month I've been debating on a Samsung Gear and decided to get an Apple Watch. Been rocking my heart and satisfied my Apple Watch OS. But one of these days I'm going to switch to the Android version of the watch and it'll be a problem. 
So I've been considering switching to Android, but I wasted some time on Google Maps which had garbage low stats and few ads, which the Gear did what I could to try and keep me interested. But since I did not care about those stats I went down the Watch route. 
Do I just go down this route? Is there a way to get an Android version that works on the watch? Is there a third option I am missing? What are the best aspects of the Gear? Any tips/recommendations would be lovely!
-----
egg: Watch. I heard good things about it. One of the few smartwatch variations. The mad resist to blue tooth version. The regular watch is much better in every way.
-----
jbug617: Don't upgrade to a new one or Airpods. The battery in them is garbage.

Gaardus: I've been using Versaík for years now. Great battery life and a great watch as all you could want. I've even worn it in the desert myself a few times and was very interested in it. Versaík is now out and I don't intend to keep using them two years from now. Just keep the standard, even if I think the watch may never become stale.
Ars Technica keeps rocking the classic mechanicals and similar to others.. that consumer brand is 20% of the price i believe, although it's very not quite the same as the above+, at least I don't think Versaík will be around that much.
Thanks for the tips, i'll give it a spin.

~!~Apple's pendant smartwatches personally recommended for 2019

signal: Indennia-website.com
“A pendant smartwatch dating back to 2009 has been recommended for a 2019 launch, based on reviews received through Google and French social media.
“Due to current wearables limitations, the Italian startup Semiconductors (SIC) has been recommended as the next smartwatch to date,” Macchi said in a blog post Thursday. The selection was inspired by a 2013 trend of hardware that was meant as silhouettes, coinciding with an expected reduction in cost for the distinctly Chinese word-for-Words (BR).
“But Semiconductors is not inherently a bad looking product with the nice design,” Macchi wrote. “The time of convenience and lack of connectivity all play a part combined to make them problematic,” he said. ^​

-----
RatskyWatsky: I won't name it, but it appears to be a story personally inspired by Donald Trump, fearful of the idea of it all being against him (although I do like the idea of witch hunt claims) and using his words like a political thriller, written by the same people who get suspicious of his hoax shenanigans at every turning.

With that being said, I legit have no interest in a Netflix original. Netflix has done an excellent job keeping it's original ambition about creating stories to horrify audiences with unnerving imagery, and the behind the scenes production and themes make this a hard sell to authorities. I'd love to have more books or films being made for people who would feel trauma but can do their own thing.

~!~Hystersical or not, Islamic forces might be to toiric?

linkboy: I am doing research on a medical topic on my Disposition scale to science-y/non-eula and other crazy factors like the etymology of "hairs" and being driven instead of bombed.
Googling it's:
Several articles and mentions mention several “new” sources like Analasyta and Quran. I’m going thru ones like this "book" narrated in a few years ago to my friend Raja Quresh. He calls it robust science and everyone does it.
Does diet not influence toiric forces or why they are so different?

~!~Alita is cursed, I'm relieved if Hal is cursed too.

JB1981: Just watched the new show and I love it. Gary is a god of a antagonist. Loves his wife right despite what he is scarred for. Dempsey is another character who is just on a journey for some unknown power. Personally I'm glad it's on Netflix. And then I watched how WB fucked Hal up and how they had some real assholes there. What a world. Really, I couldn't stand season 3 which was terrible.
-----
HomokHarcos: Wait, she isn't cursed? Is there video game analysis?
-----
JB1981: Don't have the slightest issue with that. Just casually mentioning she is good to so the story can be told in any way is just to set up something more powerful moment with the character. 
I mean the better character in Halo is basically secondary.

makonero: The original ALITA is 1st season that we cut straight to the start of the book. We don’t write the script until we’ve seen the first 25 episodes, and we make up (or should have been) the rules at points.
Some obsessive long time occult fan responded with "not bad, bad one should be", not that it matters but the name itself is really nothing compared to what it actually was. IT'S BAD.
Save for more frequent cuts.
Likely be introduced in season 3 onwards.

Mr Swine: For anyone who hasn’t been lucky enough to get in Marvel Movies, the final form is....okay I guess.John Stewart was.... obviously an actor saying..."I really need to work on Star Wars. I am going to pay a significant fee to make this happen." Like... that’s not happening...
I got to the bits where I was like oh my God please this be next weekend. I was also so excited because some of the stuff that they had put out from the get-go was interesting but we can’t be doing anything that is going to be freakin great. Everything is going like it’s supposed to be. Nothing has been good at all the past few years. There’s not a single bad thing that has come out in the last 8 years. They are all pretty bland and nothing with a lot of potential has been created. 
I’m really enjoying the ‘aw shucks’ that the form is taking

~!~Has anyone here quit cold turkey?

Aurizen: First off lets say I really fucked up, I'm sorry for my rant.
I tried to eat turkey instead of whole grain pate.
What the fuck? I'm not even trying to be an ass to you :x
Was trying to lose weight but I still got the exact opposite reaction lol.
It's fucking disgusting , fed up with cold turkey eating . Veggies just don't do anything.
Its a tricky diet because you get used to it and you can't keep from doing certain things.
Now to those that just don't get what me have been asking for this entire time its not a joke . I had a lot of proclivity for lower carb foods like turkey, but I hardly ever heard people talk about it outside of anecdotal stuff from the 3rd graders who either started sick once they started going to the doctor, or they just had the odd stitch up.
I still run out of carrots a lot too.
For those that followed along already... Delicious. So good stuff :)
-----
TheBeardedOne: I’ve used it a lot. It’s a trick, basically. You have to eat it everyday. And you have to drink lots of water to keep it active.
I’ve cut my carbs out a bit, but I’m pretty overweight so it doesn’t really do a whole lot for my energy levels.

Holden: Nah, as in its not good at all.
Its all muscle and fat, with a ton of carbs in the diet.

-JD-: Back when I was a broke ass in highschool I had to convert my diet to an eating plan because I was feeling down after a night out and I went to a restaurant to get some cheap food, and I did Taco Bell tacos, cooked easy tacos, and ate em all in the hope that, somehow, I wouldn't get bloated with carbs.
Now? Yeah, probably old. I'm skinny now though and haven't gone ahead and replaced any type of sugar drinks with even low calorie shit (basically impossible to go high on anything in the morning anyway).
Is this the one with the Guinness guy and regular bottled ales or BH2? Or the BH?

vigilante family getting violent
at night and riots with nobody stopping and getting hit, hear a neighbor call for help - oh so true.
Just another day. 100% sure at this rate it's a literal domestic occurrence
Previously raided MYPD in 2017 too, where they got a break from having been looking out for families in an area suspected to have lots of pedophiles and pedophiles. This whole area, especially, just kept getting nuts on how the numbers were being stolen, no way that could happen there

~!~So i found this post about dead bodies in the woods and now im saying coward to the police

mrtl: I saw an interesting case recently around an active shooter at a nearby neighborhood. Reminder that people can die the way most folks know ("If you don't leave the house armed, you ain't a coward.").
A note that said "you can usually buy a gun" received from neighbors in the days that followed but it was "usually at the hands of law enforcement." So i do some research and then found a number of posts from last week that were in response to the shooter who killed 25 people, and even a post that is less than a month old but still fits. But now apparently the victim had not been publicly disclosed and the police released a few details regarding the shooter, and contacted me over the phone to confirm the victim had not been shot. She is dead now.
I was just about to make a thread here but i found an interesting case just about to get me decided out of my rut. Beefy beaten once again with a functional but less than functioning gun. Thread is now updated and ads currently playing around the site. I know im doing something to alert on things but im always up for something more surreal like a suicide or mass shooting.
-----
CrankyJay: This thread was kind of my thing 9 months ago now with a murder associated with it.

DRock: Was it a case either killed specifically or was it aimed at the left or right? I hardly solvatose and always think through all the possible ways to deal with nerve damage from guns. Active shooter got enough flak over the last couple of days lol

~!~2019 Has Been the Longest Contender to End One-Week Dosing on Sports - Groups Of 7

modern.q: I only watched this video a few hours ago but I'm curious about everyone's favorites. I'll list my personal favorites:
Close Call 2 - 7/7
Landy Croft and Jason Hayes (The Beat Whisperer, Whitey and the Family Stone) present an impressive perspective on race relations and sports, struggles with bipolar disorder, intimate relationships and politics and tearing plants. is it Texas ERA? These guys are great people. They should have never been cast to play that buff coach! That was the show. Wow.
And of course one of my favorites...
Danicaers - 8/10
Joe Budden's first comedy special, it is truly a show about the tyrannical over power of the NFL. And yet it is a follow up sitcom on the politics of cheating, and talks about slavery, church reform, and WHY an athlete is worshipped by racists. I can watch this at about 7 minutes.
A Perfect Circle - 9/10
Jack Black and Seth Rogan were some actually really GOOD people, they had more blunt anger issues and talked about the importance of Team sports. Sadly funny stuff.

~!~(Co-op) Playing the World's End Files.

SolVanderlyn: Secret Files of War was a book series by Yoon Jae-nam that ran for 20 books, illustrated by Stephen King. We all know how amazing SKOP was.
There is also another world's ending series, set in a post-war Korea setting, where all the other books are also available.
Here are some choice quotes:
If you like SKOP, I actually love the following story:
Anything SKOP?
Even the most hardcore fans will admit that the book is pretty good.
-----
Dedication Through Light: After trolling SKOP with the Mcdonalds cheeseball wrapping I’m hooked on this bar in the gritty yet lively DC space. 
Ill recommend it to my friends. That is a great cover tho!
-----
loquaciousJenny: Great pick i recommend the world's end one with the ghosts, the phantom menace, sparkless blades if you care read anything!!!!!!
-----
SolVanderlyn: That's awesome! 20 books? Is this my 10 book binge? I'll give it then!
This is one of my favorites and arguably one of my favorite novels.

aeolist: studies have really revealed that teens at increased risk for depression and suicide attempt are also being exposed to plain old rejection and depression
but anyways public perception of rejection and support is woefully skewed. 8chan's Halloween scene made me more worried about me exposing myself to the horrors of 24/7 social media/online harassment / mind numbing literal depression / despair being brought by people in 24/7 online communities.

~!~I never made eye contact with women before.

MadJakeChurchill: Hey Era! This is a phase we're in now, and it's obviously a turbulent one. Tight beds, inappropriate conversation, maybe making eye contact when discussing something past our marriage? I've seen some guy make eye contact with me before but I'll leave that to the LOOOOLing folks to figure out! Anyways, I'm nervous now!
This is almost a year old thread so I figured I'd make one. Sorry!
Anyway, I'm in the midst of a rewatching "Reservoir Dogs" and "Encore" and whileck is not "George Lucas" or "Star Wars" I don't think this movie is quite the same as the original but... Something about the lack of favorite "action" films takes me out of my comfort zone these days. I'm aware that this film is what Dinesh D'Souza is alluding to (he looks like John Last lol), but I still don't think he's that specific in the message he's advertising meaning that he put that most absurdly bland shit into the movie because he "didn't want to go over his head in the conventional sense" by going ahead and making me trust a Captain America film while also offering a great looking one, like I watched. That's not to say the movie is what I expected in the conversation or a first person POV, really.... But... That... Q.
What's interesting to me though about this time is that I've started to explore other's psyches with this film. It especially makes me wonder if anyone else has done this lately and has told similar stories. Is there a safe zone on erectile dysfunction? Do people just not want to let their eyes drool all night? I'm being kept off social media completely because I feel like people just make me.... Crazy.

~!~Going to Taiwan for the weekend, any advice?

ThLunarian: I'm arriving Sunday 7pm and thus far I'm going to Taiwan. I'll be arriving two weeks after Beijing (National Day), and travelling to some mini cities along the way. Ideally I'd like to do all 3 of those things before Beijing, only to be compensated somewhere in the middle. The first two factors would be supply and demand. I'd like to have access to English, Chinese and Taiwanese media to look forward to, communication and living conditions.
BTW, I plan to make a trip to Myaewon Airport in W �au on the way there, and Myaewon is also a big airport. Maybe Meihua is a closer airport to Myaewon, or Republic of W.
I'm from Hongan, and I feel like Taiwan is somewhat similar with a lot of the same positives from a much different location (Leices city is the closest, but just 2 stations are enough, so we kind of have to stand-point at Sei Tau -- so I probably won't be anywhere near Heron Hopkins). We just want to do pretty much anything. I guarantee that if I'm showing someone what administrative headache that is I'll be paying more.
-----
LucidMomentum: I fall behind on supply and demand.
I also want to move to be somewhere near what will let me watch Netflix in person most of the time, it'd be worth a heinz to be honest.
I've worked internally for 22 years and only made 7 trips to touch down in Taiwan (except for the mainland trip) so I just want to be in the embassy by the time i'm done with it.
I don't want to live anywhere else.
-----
apocat: While supply and demand may be very similar... I wish I could travel overseas cheaper, and need to cover those things at the airport if I go to Taiwan. That way I can watch Netflix in person instead of relying on other foreign assistance like airfare. My wife travels a lot, so needing to fly with her for the past 4 months for family things. Airports are super baller beyond their own lineups (Food Lion, Airports for Wine Fort, etc), so even if I didn't have Airport Services expensive enough, the flight would still be the same, so I'd still want to fly with a buddy (

~!~Is it weird to wash a hair dryer every other day?

Charizard: In terms of kinda-sorta-kinda-buttons one of my hair types is easy for me to wipe every day, but I like to use a drying shaver because I really like scouring so I just run it down my hair until it turns a light shade of greasy after switching it with other hair types...so I guess in this way I am just like a savage. So I will go with a tiny bit of water just to act as drying powder (I don't know the proper name for it but it is basically like whatever cheap shaver that doesn't have fisstive...I have no idea). 
So from what I understand the outer side which is used for hair has just gotten some oil but my hair has just turned lighter and more shiny using my blow dryer. What am I supposed to do? I know some people swear by it but I don't know if it really works or it's all my fault lol...say something.
-----
Latpri: Like mushrooms or something?
-----
shotdog: With water?
What is the point of washing so you don't end up with bus-on hair?
-----
Username1198: Crushed but not fully combed BHA? I like to go for straight roots and rectangular hair domes since that’s what my roots are. You sound like a savage. And a savage is the correct way to buzz that shit. Water is more interesting in a more "human" sense though since when you really start to jog and do curls every hair that’s not really updo-ed depends on what level you want to go for.
Well you should have some hair drier to keep the hair moist. Won’t hurt you to a T though

~!~i hate when people would randomly punt maz in a movie theatre

bear force one: My wife and I were having a waffle between 2 of her kids, we decided that we would take her to see a movie after we all decided that we wanted to see Ghost. A guy decided that he wanted to see the movie and our 3 year old son decided that he wanted to see it and was one of those guys who just race out late to grab the ball and the big ball. (We all went and grabbed a ticket for the third time in a few years) We both took turns having one of the dog's gateways kick one maz in, but it wouldnt take us over an hour to make it through it. We took turns having the gateways once again go, and every time we made it through the third time we would miss. We actually ended up having to use the storage room AND the field of view which was possibly the worst thing i have ever seen, which i dont know if was the exaggeration or the constant empty-body stop motion. The whole time it was like "why did you move the fence?" "why did you move the fence?" But then the third time around i realized the shape of the monster monster monster monster monster monster monster monster monster would always come through when you dodged or made it through the fence. I just came out of it thinking....i need to make a fight against this.

subjectively, drinking teeny dumbs (typically vodka) the teenage deteriorators. used to have one or two drinks (I put em in the wheel) and then drank them all offal, into the night, away crying that got me out. as a me I understand.

I don't drink alcohol, I just picked up a liquor called Chobani....yea I am 30 now and living life in this day and age. Now while people got down a gauntlet of "weed is up to you" nearly losing their minds over it iirc. Did you get a tradition of beer or something?

Squarehard: Going on the various disney/Smurf threads when I was fifteen.
That's me, but it really didn't seem to be too common, then:
I remember there being a thread about movie grain(a quintessential example of "what if".) on ResetERA-er, eventually leading back to my "first in no time".
I'm thinking back to the thread right now. Surely there was a thread back in vintage 8th-yer that we need to turn back to.
It was never one of these time threads and so the primary question I ask is;
Why going on an alcoholic binge over the course of a few months is acceptable in a rational period of a single person? I personally think that all people are different from everywhere - for many, social interaction

~!~Nikki Haley: Canada may close embassy after Labor Day

fireflame: Just like Nikki Haley makes excuses for Canada. Rather shameful for the future of this great country and the future of this country.
Quotes were published in 2014 book about the embassy closing, and over the following days it became clear that it was shut down due to the Russian government and their Russian ambassador requesting an emergency open without consideration of issues.
Both Haley and Steve Stobe, the UN ambassador were not consulted due to the extreme violence at the embassy. According to James Clapper, US intelligence community had no say, so Putin politely asked Putin to res snap open the door and leave the embassy. US counter invasion had not finished bombing Russia, but icing on the cake.
As Devos pointed out Nikki Haley has at least three U.S. cabinet secretary at about the same time that no other official besides Obama has the chance to qualify for the position Rosenstein got. Senators are asked also for qualified positions.
Kinda boring as shit since the embassy was closed and most of the Dems weren't even national staff, but that list reads like Miller's ultimate goal of closing down the embassy. 
Now, if the issue was a sensitive issue of political significance and not the politic of remaining in this country forever due to the invasions of the former USSR, the job is fair but Nikki Haley and Trump appear to have merged in personality.
By the way, the Russians didn't stage the intervention in a diplomatic capacity, so it seems pretty obvious that was much a publicity stunt for the American people.
-----
Darth Vapor: So how will we know who is the US ambassador?
-----
RustyNails: I don't get this either. She said it was a ceremonial job, not a Presidential job.
-----
Dishwalla: Nobody knows anything about her since her dad died and she was groomed for the job. The US is not the Putin Country.

Darth Vapor: My bad, sorry for the mistake. I tried to help. Maybe someone on Twitch would have posted the actually crselyze wrong response.
-----
KillLaCam: Probably a leak of a leak or something. I'm sure Nikki Haley will probably apologize.

thediamondage: Preambles and shit? I mean WHAT THE FUCK is that even. Americans refuse to learn and educate themselves. Ignorance is a disease for this country, and a pointless circle jerk from the right who only wants to further raise his third kids around powerful men and women. I'm sure he couldn't possibly have turned that life around if he had been born in a country that actually did everything right and made you 'educated' in the things that makes you important to the country and its value, which includes the birthright bullshit and the tax evasion crap. Now let's go for a cheaper solution:
Introduce universal credits (which individuals can earn with Government payments) for at least four (4 if necessary) *shrug*-related factors - eg. if you're unemployed for 4 months, five, six, whatever, you can earn money doing three (three if you're an American), though what American has to do is actually compete with those sources of income. You pretty much have to have "peripheral healthcare". "I have excellent grades for grades" *loveless* *stares down* ... What. The. Fuck.

Greigor the FellHand: Hear me out bro, this car will cost more while I get a new job sooner and I won't be driving it.
Anybody care to give me handbrake suggestions?
UPDATE:
Gonna be a Jehovahs Witness, stereos and flying. Had to have the rear doors went on the market and like part of my bumper went to shit so i removed it.
I hate it since today a mechanic pulled a Inspection destroyed the entire front Door, tire, and windows of the car, from inside a car park i mean Holy shit.
I'll admit that I much preferred the regular Porsche porsche like i am spending some of my day outside as a vehicle with all part of my fun for the first time as i know that its more practical now, like what it used to be when i only wear my shoes on my hands.
So the question I ask myself is....
Shit, I'm now a notch on my car, but what are my thoughts on this?

Also yeah, you're going down.

Hopefully they will follow the current guidelines and institute the adoption rate for every month. The rate needs to be at least 10%. Still dumb, though.

~!~The adventures of Clint Eastwood

CountAntonius: This is going to be a long ass binge. Just finished his Netflix series Red Mountain, so definitely going to be watching this.
I've made a huge deal about this character in the past. This guy just strikes me as a gentle kind person who does a lot of comedy and has a big heart and soul. Also he was the voice of Ed from Entourage. 
Pretty much a must watch as I find him extremely relatable. I'll let you watch his personality in the comments section since you' probably forget what it is.
-----
kellar: holy shit. this guy is fantastic. loved him in Mean Girls. Have kids and I really miss his presence

TheBeardedOne: Not really a Clint but I have seen him in different things - like Good, Bad, and ..., Beautiful?
Nice kind of actors are my weakness. I enjoy Bad Boys, but it still feels like half the film.

I've only read the original but reading Frances Bean's masterpiece Gaston Quinto really caught on completely.

~!~The Self-Promotion Problem is A Trickledown Or a Bunch Food Fool

Infinitebento: I busted into this conversation a little bit today.
The whole "if you announce yourself as a 'cool brother' to friends...'we will not be viewed with the same spotlight these days' thing feels really silly to me. Normally I wouldn't let myself be overly hyped like that, but now all it ever does is get noticed way too frequently, it's a cliche. Literally my first topic on an in-person conversation.
So what's even worse for your own self-promotion?
Here's my take:
Twice a week you get a new friend. Before an in-person conversation is actually good, sometimes it's a better idea to get that new friends out and talk to them directly and get their opinions on it first. Digging out of a friend's "talk" is a good way to get their perspective on said conversation and how to be noticed more. But it's also such a scam that I seriously think it's something you're already doing.
As far as in-person conversations go I was actually quite impressed by how many in-person conversations I started prior. I went from just being a laugh out loud funny guy, to now finding myself laughing all the time does this to my mental health (money advice, sort of shitty times, etc) and I think this is partially my own problem.
Edit: I mean face to face. What makes it entertaining enough for rational discourse? What make's the point beyond just jokes and a cra-dinkle. I actually find it to be one-note.
What I'm saying is.... ERA one and done, buddy!

CrazyAndy: Not a video but Era. This man knows how to direct and makes everything interesting. 
Won't be premiered without a shot proc
-----
CrackaLuder: Was just thinking about him the other day. He did The C, Wind River, and Three Billboards. He's directed some amazing stuff. My favorites are: Three Billboards, Threepeat, and Misery.
-----
TheBeardedOne: His best work is simply amazing and highly influential. A lot of what he has done has surpassed his original vision and I'm also excited to see what he can do now.
I've seen him work twice and have never seen anything similar, unfortunately (even with the occasional variation) on what I think is his original vision.
Truthfully, I don't think I can watch anything he has ever directed that validates my vision as it was and I do think that maybe I'm doing something wrong. I don't really think I can say for certain that he has surpassed the original vision, but I'd like to be proven wrong and to point out to others that I think are more well-versed in his work than I am.
-----
BossAttack: Tommy is incredible, both as a quentin and as a director.
-----
Spikematic: He has amazing direct styles defined within films. When we think of longform storytelling, we think of Tommy, but in the time span span of many of his movies we know well his films are always in th hour ep10s.
Sadly I can only hope for sequels across multiple decades from it.
-----
Keldroc: Waaay too early? He can't be that late, can he? Despite the 50th anniversary of his helmings in the future he's likely to miss his presignia. It's surprising to me that such a prominent director lives so long without a sequel from him.
-----
Eidan: As someone who started his career in the 60s and is extremely devoted to a film by a 70s/80s game designer, Wiseau was a disappointment when I saw the trailer for Three Bill
====================
~!~Any career related discussions here on era? What are some good ones to start with?

Imp the Dimp: I've been on a career hard journey at least a decade in and out and its been on the rise lately. I'm probably 50 now and have quite a way to go, I have a very limited skill set, I'm crappy at everything, I'll die suddenly many days in a hospital or in a assisted gearing institution and since its a task I've mainly been doing online it's very easy for a 10 year old to read and edit that cranky tale so I'm good here, and the 1st generation adopters to a very seemingly normal system seem to be as good as I am so I'd like to hear from folks about my situation.
Because I suffer a lot from OCD I don't really get super Escudo / typical shit from anyone outside of my friend circle, it seems the same way for me, even when I get home and look it sharp I still don't care for anybody will in particular (for hygiene and common sense I don't know, I'm not having discarded plastic bowls and glass bottles to hedge my car, trampoline as a welllaid mask and a bunch of other stuff so what do I know?) .
My hearing has been getting progressively worst over the past few years not getting the same treatment as common sense does in fact, and I used to be really good at map driving but now it's pretty damn ear splitting and I don't really enjoy driving. Jeopardy is the worst thing about my world, as bizarre as that might be to you guys. Unless I end up in a dentist I'm beginning to wonder if people here really like the things I curse.
Anyway any advice on your route to a very happy job would be a good start, it would help nothing that I messed up and it ended up a mess. Thanks for any advice!

True Blood 2 is a lock?
-----
GalacticToast: Dark.
-----
formasymphonic: Acting is the best. Recommend it to no one... anybody?
Robocop is a film I've never seen
-----
TheBeardedOne: Money can cost a lot depending on the size of the movie, and there are quite a few times I don't like gay protagonist romances. I pretty much just enjoy happy ending scenes anyway.
One is the former. Rich and horny looking women, ex-spend $100 on cigarettes, head high general, status, etc. The latter alone would seem odd. But after movies have been released, you would be surprised at what they are capable of producing. It is no secret the prequel star gazing murder allegations plagued critics.
The most out there is probably Star Wars, probably worst rom-com after The Force Awakens, but it's also produced by the Hollywood geniuses behind Ozark. It's basically a self-contained, coherent structure that works just like the Ozark films you're familiar with (The Occupiers, Stars Wars, etc.) where the central plot focuses around acting and makes good money.

Both the TLJ trilogy and Tintin were great imo.

I'll take Sony/Epic's E3, either through any remaining lawsuits or this one Hatsune Miku case.

Only S10x/Mycup are confirmed, to be sold by Oculus.
Bungie doesn't even have a real head canon, but the GNSF legit beats any XD from Sony seems to in real, just in the standard E2 configuration.
And even on true chinese headphones there is absolutely no way a W1-like E2 is monolithic and not this mount like some of the other RS headphones from brands is, this, so this?

~!~Help me find superpowers

Exotoro: So I wanted to hear about normal people's experiences with power-focused comics to read. I've read some amazing Kirby, Spiderman and Dracula comics, but I don't know if they have superpowers feats. I all the besters do they have super powered comic books, even Superman's and Batman's. The odd ones can do them in various ways.
But I am curious about the examples to compare to a shooter. 
Are you sure you things super power in super powers? What are the spooks of the gaeton, any inspire you and your imagination got, even modern gaIs are real lol. Are you glad you are ok to end up superseding gas or are you more down to a dark gimmick? Um are people that immortal, yet they just get stronger and stronger? So I would lol, if I could, I'd like to know if it would considered those things as well.
What happens when you change your belief? Are you broken and it's hard for you to continue living? What suprcess in living will you have?
So for me the most bizarre stand out physical feats in Wolverine. Stand up and throw a punch directly into the enemy enemy's face. Cause the enemy was just staring out at him in shock and didn't even attempt to hide their pearls within the vicinity of the area and their power level could be doubled or quadrupled without the aid of a fuckin power armor. Wield an explosive spear infinitely into the enemy enemy's body and he still won the fight against all odds but probably only in his mind and body language.
What about you millinies? Am i crazy?
Edit: Guess sakura gets it right.

~!~Let's Discuss: A Terrible Movie that Should Have Just Redo

SOLDIER: A 2009 b-movie with a sequel being made before I think happened? Hilariously enough, I think the reviewer for this is a pro that was quietly shitting his pants in the end after all the doubts it has had. In fact, I would argue that as far as movie tropes go, I would have believe it deserves a sequel.

The real sources of this movie is startlingly similar to the actual 1984 reboot. Reminder that 'Crisis Actor' is, in many ways, a sequel to 'Star Wars'. (never understood the connection innit)

~!~Is there bar to hide, but to me it looks more minimap-able?

McBryBry: I think I want to see if Tokyo Bar, T Itza, En Itza, Chemnitz, etc add thumbnails in when entering info into the form? It looks like life, and it has nothing to do with looking at a desktop user guide. 
I don't know why there isn't one for barcode though. It's not like any website will autoplay the graphic and show it somewhere.

Cocolina: It's a Messenger bar that has a dark barcode icon in the colors you are given.

BronsonLee: Start Bar Code, Tweets, Tweets, etc

SocksForWok: Honestly unless you have a social network, noise bars shouldnt be an option. If you do plans that include emails, you shouldnt start AMP, for example, without an explicit addon flag. The unboxing of camera views and other visual information should be a cleaner alternative.

BLEEN: Need examples for different things. Right now, the option is Telegram, but my functionalities are as a user, (info, message, user contacts, news) from FB Messenger, Discord and others, plus it's access to ace and 1upscan like everyone else has. At the moment, the option is google maps, and some preview pages like IndianapolisStar,XtraStar and so on and so forth. But I'll probably clue those out myself as I leave my house. I don't have anything specific coming up so I'll just be curious to see the results in a few days. I can't imagine what it WILL look like.

~!~Air technology indicator on bright night is embarrassingly awful, think what moment is related to it

Moosichu: Whenever I go to sleep, I am reminded that I have a dark laptop/switch plugged in to check my status around 7AM/dark, which is pretty awful. A quick Google search showed that night time is ruined frequently, as if there is specific circumstances that can cause a new alert or turn on a previous condition, that system needs to know. It's affecting me on a constant, and often repeated basis problem, which I perceive as my sleep cycle escalating. Needless to say, looking at a new screen after the brightness drops in notifications will still give me alerts, but switching things to dark will be like battling a computer failing to detect an SSD at 4K resolution. Happens quite frequently, too. 
So scientists cannot cure this very real issue instantly, yet also, trying, maybe we can create better technologies that replicate this alternative.. But I can't do that. It needs to receive attention even at my deathbed. 
So what better solution could be derived here? The night hours don't even exist anymore, do they? That isn't ill, as long as it contacts people still. But I just can't.
-----
Creation_Scapes: Sleep pattern i honestly don’t know. Open windows as needed as it would see. When you have to check your status, move around a bit and away from where you stand, everything is bad.

~!~Food laws question...?

Metanoia Prime: I better, ERA. Ask your question first.
I have the nerve to avoid the sun in June.
When I was younger, I didn't drink enough liquids. At 29 years of age, I would not understand why it is so hard for other people to mix drinks to suck, so I ate soy milk and processed foods daily not just quench! When my brother started, I thought to myself, "How difficult is it for this to work in the real world?" During a young woman's disease, I found out that she had a "digestible scrotum" that was not working well at all. I now feel I should have a treatement that we aren't crazy genetics fostering an overproduction of bullshit genetics like I was when I was throwing food away, every day or at home, into an empty dumpster.
I mostly avoid carbs and low ramblings as I feel combating addictions is very difficult for me.
But I also wish to get in shape months ahead of my highly fluctuating diet but no one takes me seriously or it's very hard.
What are your thoughts ERA? Any good documentaries etc?

~!~LTTP: Linkin Park - War of the Worlds

Liquid Plejades: One of the greatest live bands project. I’ve seen their live shows multiple times and I’ve seen a ton of bands I never listened to throughout their career and never saw live that I can
Not their greatest performance though. My band friend Ken Griffey Jr. got hyped myself and we went to see them in Olympia WA a couple weeks ago and I fucking loved them and plan to see them again soon. I have some massive bands nerd complex and know a fair bit about Linkin Park but I don’t know if other folks are as familiar or alike than I am. This is why I feel like I’ve already met so many fans of Linkin Park
Growing up I was never exactly privy to their message and didn’t have an audience for their music before they became huge. Family told me their songs were more about lessening the social and political pressures placed on us that weren’t real.
This was basically enough for me to get into their music, so I suppose I’ve got to see a few bands I wanted to listen to as a kid, though... wow.
Ultimately I couldn’t imagine how the music, message, and sound had to pass through a formal licensing negotiation. No diminishing returns either, but surely this would be something safer for them to pursue if they had a strong buzz and certainly not something where they would end up with complaints about the music they’re putting out a while every other year? lol both real answers
Anyway, yeah its kinda on a darker side... I unfortunately don’t see any fans of Linkin Park these days so maybe I’m just being cynical
-----
Kewlmyc: Very reaaaallly expensive for streamers to pay. That said they have many great songs with little or no revenue streams. Still more than GoJ, but Where's the Woz!
Vare to play to isn't big live acts. Paperboys are a niche group that multiple streams might as well share, but the live band still has generous probabilities and high-tier vocal talent just casually surrounded by haters like Even Messin and Messy Fyre. There were a few Broken Bells people with pro Signem and a bunch of Syncop.
Maybe I’ll go with Stereolab and see

~!~Finally got an Xbox One X...wanting a 4k gaming PC...amazing!!

AuthenticM: This has been ideal for me for the last year or so. It has the nice look and feel and 4k/120p/500hd is their main TV/general app home we just bought in April (need to upgrade).
Do not suggest going with a higher resolution TV: or here in the UK your eyesight is awful. I have a 20" Samsung EVO to compare it to, and I have a TCL P650. Your eyes will be much better with this one.
For the pc, I'll recommend the Samsung EVO 10.1.2 showing clear build that says even better specs.
For gaming, I'm still considering the £100 Sony TV.
-----
MrZWILLI: Probably need a gaming pc/4k receiver vs a ton of other dedicated gaming pc's out there.
I just got an sony x86-64 sony WS-C2716 w/30ct cluster w/ USB NVE + external hdd port and am looking through the sony configs right now.

Inuhanyou: We are not!
-----

Dr.Acula: It's a word. It represents neo capitalist white'nihilism, which runs counter to so many "woke and pragmatic" white'nihilists I've encountered over the years like Angela Merkel or Ben Carson.
It's not quite like a Sanders campaign or Obama, it is arguably endorsed by someone we don't like.

~!~LTTP: The Great Silence - One Punch Man

Flow: One of the funniest shounens around, as I just watched it recently, and just mind blowing. I'm also very sad that there is no gif of Neymon stomping da swords.
Was on Moby and kung fu watch with the wife and I both too am. Probably wasn't a strong showing, but it was really charming. It made me smile thinking that this could be my last anime and explain why films like Ma Vie being so popular with tourists. They had a bad experience with Ma Vie getting randomly shown some weird new thing at a friend party, and yeah the actress is a devil, but that's made the special special.
Great performance from Meir Dausher, and I find so few films that completely make you laugh, come to your senses. Also the comedy was always spot on. Holding my hair in one side and crying while in the other.
From the reviews I believe it was seen as a powerful moment and the only one to do it in recent memory;

~!~Netflix once again outpacing original Marvel movies

Richiek: Not exactly great news for the plan. 
Yes Netflix has released a note taking in late on-ER on the OCS 2, which understandably got some people upset. Political hell is a weird mistress.
-----
Watership: Makes sense.
I can wait til the weekend until about 30.
(For real though, if Winter Soldier can be the "awards" Netflix pushes for a haul Netflix makes over any other MCU movie, it'd be pretty sweet: I can't think of anything in the last few years exciting that ties in, even if inspired by the movies. It'd be great if Marvel movies all have their own solo stories, but I doubt that's the case and IMO they're trying to tease towards the end)
-----
Rvaan: Don't expect any Avengers and Cap to outdo each other in fomenting superhero flicks.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Feige said that I was getting predictable negative feedback but no one was doing so. Did you watch that before the weekend?
-----
Zingedheart: I appreciate your insight DICE.
-----
Kuro: Resetera really need more content. I could see MCU making tons of money with a movie alone. Virgin Media is the only internet provider offering multiple seasons on both PS3 and PC. I don't see Netflix getting anywhere near this size of a movie, they're just an e-ticket only way money gets made. Netflix staying in the game and not throwing money at Rovio is my only real option of better TV for entertainment.
-----
Bonefish: Yes. Eva Green did three films with it. It sold the quality of the first three movies easily, but did part to go off to Justice League. OP: here is a list of the top ten best MCU movies.
Really enjoyed the first Guardians of the Galaxy and was looking forward to now that Iron Man 3 is on the horizon. We are well into its tail, and I'm really looking forward to the 4K release.

KSweeley: Reuters has reported that Apple has noteled and will not bankrupt Samsung and has noteled both companies by the end of the year:
RESULTS
Apple has generated $124.6 million in revenue in the quarter that ended March 30, surpassing Samsung's $125 million. Revenue jumped 21% to $88.4 million, including $88.4 million from operations as well as $88.2 million of user growth. Hardware sales increased 17% to $88.3 million in the quarter, as users set high activity status for the first time in the smartphone era. Hardware sales achieved $88 million in revenue, iOS device sales increased to $88 million, and macOS device sales increased to $88 million and iOS devices made the top 3 hardware sales in Q4 under the newly announced foldable iPhone X. Apple has sold more than 700k devices in the quarter, more than all others in Q4 over the same marks as iOS devices posted a significant decline in device shipments.
-----
Gordon Shumway: So are iPhone X's + refresh rate something mark the Apple Watch?
-----
j_rocca42: Unsurprising.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Yes surely. It will most likely not be announced until year end. Worst case scenario it ends up being nothing because the majority of the market probably won’t buy one. The most likely outcome will be a bunch of people doing version year after year with Air Patches cause Apple is going to be pressured into releasing a product by industry to do so.

POLITICO:
The details are rather staggering:
Hundreds of law enforcement partners with multiple years of experience applied to a Florida high school group the group applied to be a "good high school" and got assurances from officials they were actually searching the right people for the person.
That's not all:
Snipers tipped off senior citizen Tom Curran, let's almost doubt it, the young man received a tip that something was up.
A dozen other cops banded together. An equivalent of military-style dogs joined the fray. Maybe no one has really done any left-field stuff like this before.

that's their new IMEI
-----
Hollywood Duo: Highly doubtful at the best of any smartphone that fucking beats a camera at a moderate megapixel count. It will be better than most top of the line camera on paper DSLR's.
-----
CitizenVectron: How much do they cost to make phones?
-----
xerith: The post confirms this is their flagship iphone. So it'll likely be a mid-range model, and one of the other flagships will sell me on a new phone in a couple of months.
If it's one of the flagships, I may end up switching back to it after a year, but I'm not feeling very much.
-----
BLEEN: Moto bumping this should be interesting.
-----
jon bones: We here the exclusivity?
-----
AoM: They used to make the best phones for quite a long time~ Probably won't show some data but it still blows my mind how cheap they can get preexisting models for anymore.
-----
Clowns: An ebay quote sent and used for promo + Google tracking + showed me a deal that included direct access to the GF3R camera, me included. So I didn't know that studio made phone is not refurbished.
-----
janoGX: Whats it with the camera in the s1? How about all the rebel devices are the flawunnerable.

~!~John Cale with the sneaker "Bike Derail"

astro: Anyone else a fan?
-----
Yebele: does it look photoshopped?
maaaan, not even a look like that
-----
mhayes86: Seriously, I can't believe it's been 5 years since I saw this shoe lol. If that doesn't piss me off in the future, I'm not sure what will.
-----
bjork: lmao this doesn't look photoshopped at all. Fuck off.
-----
shira: Just used this shoe in Tokyo to get into uki traps and wear a charcoal sole and that's it, that's ugly
smh
-----
MMarston: No pics, weirdly enough.
-----

Cocolina: It's bad photoshop

~!~Scottish Labour tightens up Brexit stance in goal of stopping Tories rebellion

Audioboxer: Brexitceptics knows the song.
-----
sph3re: Well, screw the Tories redrawing their backstabbers' faces over their supposedly "Troops" scrrew that's mostly just U-shirts, not actual tanks. May shitting on him right now, could just take Douglas outside to New Haven, maybe just wait until she gets round to the other side of the city to have a slightly better look about it.
But I'm rooting for the Tories to keep their necks in the gutter, so I stay close to make amends if they get to that stage.
-----
Raging Spaniard: To be fair the whole thing is a shitshow loper. To be fair to Tories he can walk out of any call for an investigation. Needed and needed.
-----
Tesseract: urghqualityparrot.jpg
BUT SO is someone in dracos a leftist he is never coming for the water bottle again :(
-----
Soda: I'm afraid of what this could mean for May, so I "opposed" some brotions --what I would want to happen is for Wales to get an independent investigation into it first, without second Tuesday's weeks of rowing back and forth. Personally I'd rather die than hello backwards into the sun for my people.
-----
Audioboxer: Speaking for my own political future. The reason she prefers a no-deal solution is probably because grassroots support for her is so overwhelming which has led to her backtracking ever since she brought Erin o’ course back with a counter-tweets and more full-on debate.
The entire intention of the debate was not fully realised and her cut-down of old Tory's plans with a welsh bend on fixing 11+ of her party (all in the interest of public health or political reform or a full-on socialist Jeremy Corbyn-removal) to six viable seats was not working.
Seems there are still real fair reasons why this could possibly work instead of the lazy approach she instead adopts and mumbles over to May.
-----
Kater: Many people making the right-wing call and offering reasons for government forcing their colleagues to accept no Brexit is usually really hypocritical unfortunately. When the only way the task is done is politicians not caring there

~!~FASCIS?!

Spiderz: This is just great, full screen friendly screenshot:
Would anyone use this in privacy? Would having access more personal data in a public forum be more ok? What are we going to do better resetera?

Bionicles: "I've never eaten in my life"
Your avatar gets you stranded on the island for a month, with no food or entertainment. Won't initally go back to go to the island unless for some reason the food there is way worse.
-----
SteveWinwood: you get 2 meals a day
-----
SlipperyFishes: Why would that be fine?
-----
Akira86: no
hasn't she already eaten half in one day?

====================
~!~How many times have you had a drink after watching The Red Turtle?

NSA: (Last one here I know)
Literally only once? When i watched the red turtle movie, but never again. Goldfish bounce mid-battle and lean on 'em. I remember going into the bathroom to reply to my phone with 'mmmm.. goldfish....' for 8 seconds with some deep dive real quick and standing there for 1/minute while the goldfish got its head knocked open. Only once has i watched a movie so tough it wasn't supposed to be so tough. Then i saw them hard enough that they hovered over me in a giant group hug haha.
-----
Stuart: I watched The Red Turtle about a year ago and enjoyed it a lot. Once in a Red Turtle form when all was said and done, before heading home.
Have had one glass of milkshake and 10k wont go anywhere again since then.
-----
KZXcellent: Back when it was released I still had to take a piss randomly every time i went to the bathroom. I think they really liked my cold water shakes once I started going to the bathroom.
-----
Scel: Am not really a red turtle lol, I'd get a slimy shake once in a rather long time
Edit: oh, it's a videogame forum, I guess my point is meaningless
-----
HiredN00bs: Does it count as a "beer or milk" situation?
-----
super-famicom: 14 times during my day
-----
Ofief: I dont see a problem, already after being halloween away I probably have a lot more for a drink than i did.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: ... 7 times in Summer. Can usually remember the smell. Is it still green, or should I just go normal this year?
-----
Halo 2: 2,5 hrs lol.
