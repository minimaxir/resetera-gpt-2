DGenerator: I wish the show was more like Planet of the Apes.
-----
Medalion: Good for him... but I'm sure he won't be making as much as he wants to for the money
-----
Galkinator: He's not going to get a million for this one, he's going to get a million for his private show.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Is that the one with the 4 grown sons on it?
-----
Galkinator: Yes, but like... he's going to get a million for this one, and also get a million for his private show.

~!~Is there actual reason to keep Raja Satyra as Prime Minister?

fireflame: I have a lot of problems with the current situation in India and I think that it would be interesting to know if there is any real reason to keep Raja Satyra as Prime Minister. There is no one in government who is willing to keep him as PM. I am curious if there is any true reason for him to be kept as PM.
-----
ryseing: I only see the 2nd option, no reason to keep him as PM.
-----
jelly: It's not a good thing that he's PM. He's a house minister and a few of his ministers are corrupt.
-----
Rodney McKay: He's not even the first Indian politician to die out and end up dead in the parliament.
-----
Kolx: Why not just let the next PM be the next Prime Minister?
-----
rsfour: As long as he's a house minister I guess.
-----
Ferrs: I didn't think he was prime minister.

Euler: Why is it still an issue that he resigns?

~!~Car and Driver Errors: Need Help

Mr.Mike: Tried to recall a car and got this:
It has a manual transmission with no boost springs in the body. I was looking into a manual car and ended up getting this one. I'm wondering which of the following two errors you guys received?
edit - I'm not looking for a quandary, I'm looking at the ABSOLUTE DULL ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE
-----
Krakatoa: Just a simple reset maybe?
-----
ZOONAMI: That would be a very handy place to dump your data if you had issues.
-----
Mr.Mike: We're at a point where it's hard to have certain things on autopilot.
-----
Krakatoa: There is no question that autopilot has been a godsend. If you can't get your foot off a branch without some kind of intervention from the individual on the other side, you're probably guilty of steering in the wrong way... this is just a springboard for a more automated response.
-----
Krakatoa: I'm sure that's the best way to go about it.
-----
Mr.Mike: Not sure. I've read about a rise out of autonomous driving. I've also read about people who just need to get a certain amount of control over the cars and then a certain amount of control over the driver-less car.
-----
Krakatoa: I've also read that driverless cars are almost unavoidable at certain speeds. It's mostly on higher speed. But on lower speed, the driverless car can't get over the road and needs to get up.

RastaMentality: This is a little more than ideal but it’s a step in the right direction.

Laserdisk: I still use the TCL one to my house.

Darknight: No more ads, just a consistent stream for the most part.

BronsonLee: I'm surprised that they phased it out in the first place cause they don't care about your privacy

Proteus: No more ads. Just a consistent stream.

Jpop: I agree.

Kelsdesu: I've been using the Prime app since the app launched and it's been fantastic. I just wish there was a way to stream it all over to multiple devices.
-----
xxracerxx: Same.
-----
RastaMentality: I mean like it's like an ad on the TV...
-----
RastaMentality: I’m sorry, but Prime Video doesn’t stream how I want it to. It’ll only show the first 2 episodes of a show every week.

~!~How do you deal with insomnia?

Hate: So I’ve been dealing with insomnia for about a decade now. It sucks. I’ve got a bad bout of the chemical insomnia, and it’s really annoying. I’ve been on there for a month now and I feel like I’m going to have a rough time. I’ve been with my psychiatrist for about a month now and I found that lithium is the one of the meds I actually enjoy having and I enjoy it too. I’m not in the mood to be out of cotton candy for the day.
I don’t know. I don’t know. I just got diagnosed with Sertraline, a drug that is prescribed to treat ADHD. I’m in awe of it. I don’t know how else to deal with it. I’ve been having intense mood swings for a while and the last couple of sessions I had with it were the ones I thought were overhyped and fake. It was real. I don’t know. I just feel like I’m dealing with a bad trigger for the rest of my life. 
So I’m wondering how do I stay awake and engaged during this time? I’ve been having a rough time staying awake. I just had a rough time sleeping. I usually have a rough night’s sleep but a few times I can sleep for hours, sometimes not for weeks, sometimes more than that. I think I’m starting to get tired and I’m just wondering how do I get rid of it.
-----
BronsonLee: Don't do it you monster
-----
ILikeFeet: get a heavy, strong workout in and sleep
-----
Hate: Oof.
-----
Kendrid: I use stimulant sleep aid sleeping aid.
-----
Dishwalla: sleep with the intention of being in it for a while.
staying engaged in it for a long time is just ridiculous.

~!~Will the MCU be a "Phase" of sorts?

TheGamingNewsGuy: For those who do not know - MCU Phase is when we know what is in the movie and just knows what it is going to look like. 
For example - In the comics we know Captain America is in the MCU and that's all we know of him so far. But in the MCU, it's like - In the comic book movie Captain America is in the MCU and we know he is in the MCU. But then in the MCU, a lot of actors are in the MCU and we don't know what's going to be the first or the last movie of a movie that starts or finishes being in the MCU. 
So - Will the MCU get more films of characters in the MCU - MCU Phase 4? Will we get more Spider-Man films and Spider-Man Homecoming - MCU Phase 5?
-----
Mr. X: MCU gets more films per film out of a phase.
-----
Fury451: I don't think so.
The MCU's Phase is when we know what a movie is worth and are very invested in the current MCU.
-----
Bronx-Man: I think we'll get more Spider-Man movies and Spider-Man Homecoming.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: This is true - but not by a long shot
-----
egg: I think they will. 
It's not like they started every movie with Spider-Man.
-----
Mystic: I think this is a stretch, but I would imagine that the MCU will get more Spider-Man films over the course of the next 10 years.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I am right about that - the MCU is Phase 4 right?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Oh yeah we know - in the comics the first Spider-Man movie was in the Ultimate universe
-----
Fat4all: i dont think so
i think they will get more of those Spider-Man movies over the next decade

ElectricBlanketFire: Make sure to buy at least a set of AirPod computers.

Cocolina: Get an old roommate

Powdered Egg: Buy a second TV and use AirPods to turn it on.
-----
Griselbrand: I've been in the woodstock for the last week and I've found that most of the things I'm looking to do are budget repairs that don't really interest me anymore. My main goal is to make as much money as possible while still having enough to live comfortably.
-----
Hank Hill: I'm trying to budget for what I want to do. I'm not really a fan of cash, but I've heard good things about the cheap G Series. I'll need to research other budget electronics, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting stuck on the right path.

I'm looking at AirPods 2 and the Sony 1000x, I was also looking at this:

~!~I just watched a really strong horror movie, and it was actually good?

Durden: This is a weird thread. This movie happened to me after I watched the first hour of The Thing. I'm not a horror guy, but I watched this at home and thought it was pretty good. I loved the premise, it really dealt with the fear and trauma of being young, and the horror itself was very clever. 
I'm thinking it's possible the movie is a product of the Sci-Fi Writers/Performances, or a mishmash of other ideas that I already picked up. I'm not sure, I haven't seen it in a while, but I've seen a few other movies that didn't seem to get me to understand it, and I'd like to hear other examples. I guess if I can figure it out.
-----
Daffy Duck: First two I'm watching tomorrow
-----
Vulcano's Assistant: If you want to see a horror movie first, watch it from start to finish.
-----
ILikeFeet: this was not a movie i was expecting it to be good, but for some reason it made me want it to be good
probably the most unconventional premise for a horror film I've seen in a while, it's actually pretty good
-----
Brandino: This movie sucked? I remember being hyped during the first half, then started watching it after the second half and started watching it way more.
-----
Daffy Duck: Yup. First half I think, second half I actually kinda liked it, third half didn't age well for me, fourth half was so scary it was hard to not hate it.
-----
cagey: Anakin vs Darth Maul.
-----
Elderly Parrot: Of these two, Clone Wars was the best

Daffy Duck: Yeah, I saw it in a theatre. It didn't look like anything original to me, but it was entertaining enough.

How do you deal with it?

CormoranStrike: I don't get it either. I just don't want to live like this. I don't know why I'm even here.

Hail Satan: I don’t like it when people do it. I don’t get it when people act like it’s something that they’re doing for fun, it’s just not a thing for me. I know that’s what I’m guilty of all the time, but I’m not mad about it.

~!~Slayven and I had a few of the best Double Wages

Scarecrow: I'm not a baseball fan, but I've been a fan of baseball since I was a teenager. The stories of how the teams almost always bounced off each other and how it's almost always a great day when it's not. The game is so varied and thrilling, and while there's some pretty entertaining takes on certain numbers that do a good job of suggesting a long-term payoff, there's also some hilariously dumb numbers sprinkled here and there. It's pretty hard to find a good story about how the players almost always bounced off, but it's a fascinating exercise in spectacle that probably belongs in every baseball book store.
The most impressive numbers for a Triple Wides in baseball are below.
-----
The Last Wizard: Double Wides?
I’ve never been that big of a fan but I’m glad I’ve never been that big of a fan.
-----
gutter_trash: I don't remember the last time I saw a baseball game I could not hate.
But I haven't been that big of a fan for years.
I just remember seeing so many great triple Wides in action in the 90s, then getting bored and never watching them and not watching the games.
-----
Septy: Triple Wides?
-----
Zelas: I'm a fan of yawalk but I don't remember ever watching a Triple Wides game.
-----
Chris1215: I remember watching a couple but not watching it.
I always felt like homerun Josh Cosley was the best Triple Wides in history in the playoffs.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I've been a fan of baseball since I was a kid but I'm probably more of a fan of baseball games now.
-----
Mr. Fantastic: I don't remember the last time I saw a triple wides game or a big game in my life.
But I do remember that one time I got to see a home run off of a triple play, it was probably my high school girlfriend.

FireSafetyBear: I thought that series was about Max and Fury Road?

Razgriz-Specter: I thought I remember I didn't read the OP, but this was a good suggestion.
-----
Blue: I love how these old cartoons are animated. I'll definitely give this a watch.
-----
Xe4: Glad we finally got way more exposure for these animated series. I remember there being a ton of hype for them when they started but then they dropped them due to their age.
-----
Sega Dreamcast: Yup. There's still a lot of those kids cartoons I used to love in the 90s.
-----
Exotoro: can we not derail the thread by talking about how good the animated series was, because it was bad....
-----
GimmeAWM: That's about to go down I think.
-----
Fury451: Dave was always one of the biggest comics nerds and wanted to retcon the last 20 issues of the cartoon. So they cut the episodes and made the animated series "old".

I think this is just maybe a general marketing decision but I have never noticed this. I have never noticed that in the movie "High" there is a space after "High".
Why is there a space after "High" in name of a movie?

I'm 24, and I'm a vet at a local hospital and had two appointments the very next day. This was a visit after a friend of mine had his gallbladder removed. This is vet day for the 24th time of the year. I'm getting the call from my vet and I feel so much better.
I don't know what it was, I just got this thing on my tongue and it just looked gnarly. Anyone had experience with this?

Wag: What kind of thing is a bad thing?

We definitely had horror stories.

~!~In a world of new possibilities, why is Star Wars' "Thane" film set in the Clone Wars?

Rivenblade: And why is the prequels set in the Clone Wars, a saga that has taken place before the events of the OT, and the end of Clone Wars, a saga which takes place before the events of the OT?
Star Wars: Thane is set in the Clone Wars, a world that is directly prior to the events of the OT. It is set in the Clone Wars, and is in the form of Three Jedi—a group of rebels fighting a war referred to as the Republic War. There are three main stories available to the viewer, and each one is connected to one another in some way. The Republic War is referenced in the Republic mythos, as the story goes, Thrawn was one of the rebels in the war, and the Jedi were chosen by the dark side to lead the new order of Star Wars.
Three Jedi are chosen, and they are: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lando Skywalker, Rose Tico, and Revan. They come from the Jedi Temple of Secrets, the Jedi' Grand Lodge, and the Jedi Order. However, unlike the prior stories in the OT, Thrawn was one of the chosen ones to lead the new Star Wars films. However, unlike the prior stories in the OT, he was one of the chosen Jedi to lead the new film. Or maybe it's possible, but I'm curious enough to ask here.
Why?
Thrawn is a major story event, and it's centered around the Jedi Temple. It is in the form of three different stories, the first being the battle of the Throne Room. This story takes place in the Jedi Temple in the First Order. The second being the war that began pre-DOT, and the second being the rise of Luke Skywalker in ANH. The third being the fall of Skywalker in ANH. Both are connected, but are merely fores

Teh Hamburglar: Get a treadmill running 5 times a week.

This is a stupid, and pathetic, way to push charges all the way over.
-----
Tbm24: They'll probably just pocket him.
-----
Sho_Nuff82: This is just so fucked up and the other states likely doing the same to him too.
-----
Drewton: I'm not surprised
-----
MBeanie: Yeah, I'm not surprised.
-----
jelly: Trump is doing the right thing in trying to scuttle charges, while echoing the president's words.

~!~How long before someone takes my salary?

Dest: So I was just wondering, how long until someone takes my salary? I'm currently in a tricky situation where I need to pay my bill every month. Today I did something similar to what I did with my wife. She took some of our daughter-in-law's salary, and it was pretty substantial. The bill was due this week, and so I guess I'll be taking it today.
I'm curious as to how long this will last. I'm only asking for the sake of consistency and fairness.
-----
Creation_Scapes: That is a bit extreme.
-----
Dest: It's going to take a while to accrue, but I'm sure someone will come by and give you a good chunk of the payout.
-----
Tesseract: you can do it, you just need to wait. 
I love the idea of this.
-----
Dest: No, but at the very least it's something.

~!~The "Lost" Avengers: Age of Ultron

RatskyWatsky: Source
A little bit more than a year ago The Avengers was re-watching a few Infinity Gauntlet episodes and I was reminded of how much I missed the Age of Ultron film. What are your thoughts on the series?
-----
Rvaan: What was the point of the movie?
-----
Tralfamadore: I enjoyed it; I'll watch it once it's all over.
-----
Shugga: I liked it, gave enough closure to the rest IMO.
-----
The Real Jeremy: It was a fun watch. It's my favorite marvel movie and one of my favorite MCU films. It never felt too pre-planned.
-----
BadWolf: It's definitely my favorite MCU movie.
The pacing was tight as well.
-----
GrimJawz: It's my favorite MCU movie.
-----
SArcher: I still need to see the rest of the films.
-----
CassCade: I enjoyed it, I agree with the way the movie went down in the trailers (which I really didn't care about). I liked it, but I liked the characters.
-----
jph139: I think it's pretty amazing that a slew of movies has been released in such a short time frame. I think it's incredibly impressive for an entire genre, and the sheer amount of material the films have put together has been unprecedented for such a span of time.
For me, I'll probably see it once it hits the big screen. I've seen only two of the most notable movies in the genre so I'll probably see it again.

~!~The "you're dead" is an interesting development in the Trump administration's handling of the #MeToo movement

Zipzo: I saw this article yesterday and it's pretty interesting given the current climate of sexual misconduct and the administration's recent handling of it. 
The piece itself is worth reading but I thought I'd share it. It's pretty well down and under the quoted text.
-----
Dirt McGirt: Trump administration gets away with sexual harassment for literally too fucking long.
-----
808s & Villainy: I think there's really no reason to believe Trump will ever release his/her statements. The press has been abuzz for over a year now about these cases and of course the media is all in on them. However, it's probably more harmful and potentially harmful to the country as a whole if he does release his statements.
-----
Zefah: This is some bullshit.
-----
Khanimus: Yup.
-----
Slayven: He's just a little bitch to poor women. No doubt he'll fire his bullshit apology
-----
Demolition_Human: He's full of shit.
-----
Nothing Loud: I don’t think that’s an excuse. Not necessarily the least bit surprised. He’s only just making it seem that way because he’s scared.
-----
BWoog: "What a piece of shit. I hope I'm not a piece of shit. But I also don't care because I'm in the sunken place."
-----
Davidion: Don't know what to say here. I don't think a dumpster should last more than 3 months in a dumpster.
-----

====================
~!~I love my Switch but I'm thinking about buying a case for it. What should I care about?

Dali: I'm thinking about buying a case for the Switch but wondering if there's anyone here who has used the Switch and loves their use the Switch.
Also the price is sub fair.
-----
Goodlifr: It's not a case, it's a case
-----
Dali: I feel like I am missing out on something.
-----
Goodlifr: I used it a year and a half ago and loved it. My friend recommended it to me because it's so nice.
-----
UnluckyKate: The case is good.
My biggest issue with the case is that the plastic doesn't fold easily. (The plastic in the end will just keep getting inside and will get peeled back out.) The only reason I kept it is because it will cost more to replace the plastic on my old one.
The case is also cheaper to replace... I paid 40 dollars for the same case in 6 months.
-----
Dalek: It's not a case. It's like a sealed plastic exterior. But it's not sealed inside.
-----
nStruct: It's a case.
-----
Dalek: But the outside is just straight out of an airtight container.
-----
nStruct: So, yeah. On my first gen the plastic had a completely sealable exterior and I couldn't get the outside out, I just twisted it, popped it in and it was the plastic outside.
-----
Dali: Same thing happened to me, same thing happened to me. I bought the same material and same outer shell, same plastic exterior. But now the outside is plastic inside.
-----

====================
~!~Anyone else a Trump supporter?

Jadow: I have a coworker who is a hard worker and it has started to grow on me. 
I have good friends who are Trump supporters but I can't shake the feeling that they are Trump supporters. I have a coworker who is a hard worker and takes pride in his opinions but it is a bit overwhelming. 
We are also side of the house, coworker is a Trump supporter.
Anyone else a Trump supporter?
-----
Jadow: No one is. 
We have lots of good friends, coworker and coworko, but we are just side friends, so no. 
I usually side with Trump but I have to side with a normal Trump supporter, the ones who like to hate Starbucks and hate women.
-----
BWoog: Yes, I've been a Trump supporter for at least a decade now.
-----
AnansiThePersona: No, but I'm a staunch leftist so I'm not anti-Trump.
-----
Dr.Phibes: No.
-----
psynergyadept: No.
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: Nah, coworko and I are good friends. 
We are far apart on some issues but we're very good friends and all part of the same political culture.
-----
HStallion: My best friend is a Trump supporter and he definitely has good friends because he was a trump voter.
-----
Amnesty: I'm a progressive Trump supporter, and yes.
-----
Hjod: No, but I'm also a hard leftist, so I'm not anti-Trump.

~!~Looking for a new Art decomber.

bar_bar12: I have an extremely limited collection of various Art decombing, posters, and other merchandise. I've been working hard towards my final submission, an auction for which Art decomber will be auctioned off.
I will be posting my final Art decomber at
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Nothing too special for me. 
What are you looking for? A good poster? A good set of posters? A good set of t-shirts? A decent set of posters?
-----
TarpitCarnivore: Do you have a model gallery? If so, post pics
-----
BLEEN: I like posting my work on this forum, but I do have a gallery.
-----
Barret: I'll try to help you out, OP.
I'm not sure what the Art decomber looks like outside of posters, but it's something to keep in mind. Held boards, board games, and art prints. If you'd rather have something more in-depth, maybe a pen or similar is a good place to start.
I'll try to help you out. Don't expect anything too amazing, focus on something you can sell very very easily.
-----
Sargerus: Does it have to be a model or a printed?
But also, how much are you willing to charge for something like that?
-----
badboy78660: Lol, I'm getting the MBA for ya.
-----
Dishwalla: model gallery and model board are the two big ones, and the other one is for the generic metal ones I think. Those look like giant neon signs with small, vaguely legato designs.
-----
Barret: Still a good idea to get a model gallery and a board, I'm not even a designer.
The other one is for the sort of board you'd normally get from a Video Game Maker or eBay (the one you'd buy for getting the Windows equivalent of the card)
-----
TheBeardedOne: I have a model gallery, but I don't have a model gallery as well as I should. I'll just be posting my art for you, bar a small model gallery for me and my wife, and a cheap model gallery of our own.

~!~I'm a little scared of buying a new TV. What should I look for?

MazeHaze: So I've been debating for a while whether or not to jump in to an entire new TV from my current TV. I'm not going for OLED, I currently own a 27 inch model and I love it, but I want something a bit cheaper to basically get a replacement from my current TV. My budget is around 500-1000 CAD, not including the parts needed to build the TV. 
What I want now is something that I can watch stuff in the theater whilst still being able to view stuff in the TV's native language while the TV is playing in it. I like playing in the language aspect, but I also like playing in high bit rate mode, so I'd like something in that aspect ratio that doesn't suck the native channel may not be the best fit. 
Any suggestions?
-----
MazeHaze: I'd like something with a lot less bezels for it but still pretty big for something like an LCD.
-----
Mushroomer25: They're both pretty ugly, but you'd be lucky to get a lot of burnout out. A 6" TV with a lot of bezels would be great, as would a 4" 4K set.
-----
signal: Is the point of this thread to ask questions about buying a new TV?
-----
Mushroomer25: No. I'm not interested in a 5400 RPM fanless display or anything. I'm just interested in the random answer to the question I'll have in the OP tomorrow.
-----
Mushroomer25: I'm just curious where to find that. If it's something that I can watch in the theater and the native language being played in the native language being played in the TV's native language, I'd want to go with that. And I feel like it would be nice to have a native native native language TV on standby while I'm playing native game in the background while waiting for the game to finish.
-----
TarpitCarnivore: Whatever all you need: get a small OLED. If you're going to have the money to start buying single player sets every couple years, get a good receiver and cheap outsells on price.
-----
MazeHaze: I was thinking if I could get a Sony UBP-X

~!~Weirdest Ways To Get Rid Of Yourself

Bobo Dakes: I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I've been pretty weird for about a decade now. I'm just a weirdo.
I was just talking to a friend who lives in Los Angeles and there was this hotel where I stayed a few nights a week. They go out to drive around and they show me this thing: The Magic Wand. I was like "this needs to be in case you guys ever wanted to get rid of something important."
I was like "that's cool - I just want to have a talk" and she explained the Magic Wand thing, and then she stopped talking to me and then I started thinking about suicide. 
I'm just kind of a mess. I'm just kind of a weirdo. It's not like I've ever talked to anyone, but I just want to be like this.
I don't know. Maybe I just don't wanna be a normal person? I think I have been eating well and I just don't want to die. But I just don't know.
-----

Cybersai: Just be happy you won't have to worry about that.
-----
Deleted member 9145: I'm a weirdo too but I just wanted to just talk my ass off for a bit
-----
thepenguin55: I'm not a weirdo, but my mind is super weird. I'm always the weirdo.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I've been thinking about this for a good while now. A couple of friends I met on dating apps have explained to me how to get online in less than five minutes.
-----
Darth Vapor: I’ve had it for about ten years now... The wand will never go away.
-----
BringBackSonics: My suggestion would be to remove the wand and find a new one.
-----
Bobo Dakes: There are a couple of things I'm wondering about from then on. One is is if you're wearing a shirt over the end of the night, do you turn it off at night? I've lost the ability to wear a sweater over the shower so that seems to help with that.
-----
Vapelord: The wand is very effective. It makes prolonging the night incredibly easy.

~!~My favorite low budget movies

Bor Gullet: I'm really into occult and other weird stuff.
What are some my favorite low budget movies? I just randomly stumbled on this one:
-----
Gravy Boat: What the fuck is this movie? I haven't seen it in a while.
-----
Shugga: Oh my god
-----
Teh Hamburglar: That is the best money laundering/scandal of the year
-----
PaulloDEC: I want to see a movie that will make me fall in love with it and I'm a sucker for good drama.
-----
Bor Gullet: That's what I thought, but it's not even a good movie.
-----
Syriel: A Quiet Place is a great movie that's been in the public eye for a while.
-----
Bor Gullet: I can't even think of any good movies. I have some ideas but nothing that I can think of is on the budget.
-----
-Tetsuo-: about that?
-----
Shugga: I feel like a bad movie, but it's not bad either
-----

====================
~!~Hans Landa: The Day it rams off into a crowd

Scullibundo: Looks like he’s doing a Twitter account, as usual.
-----
shnurgleton: Looks like it can't be worse than the plot of a James Bond parody
-----
broncobuster: Hmm.
-----
Volimar: His face is always so weirdly genuine. It almost makes you want to puke.
-----
BDS: I thought he was still tweeting?
-----
Scullibundo: He’s still tweeting while this is happening.
-----
Deleted member 37107: Just a really long tweet. It's like a winner. Gives the whole thing away.
-----
Yerffej: He's a dumb douche bag.
-----
Sweeney Swift: Your thoughts?
-----
Taki: I'm not saying it's bad. But it's not a good movie

~!~Is it OK to date your way of living from an old employer?

entremet: So I've started a new job in the area of real estate (not a realtor). It's a tiny apartment building but it has a lot of office space. I've been working my way up to the building manager.
The owner is genuinely pretty happy with the building and was thrilled to move there because he was desperately looking for a new job. The small office is getting pretty big. You have to be pretty lucky to move to an old employer.
I moved to a new city a few years ago, in part due to a realization that I was not going to be attending my friend. I started life at a small hotel and was fortunate enough to get a job right out of Uni. After that, I got a full time job at a hotel.
I'm going back to my hometown in hopes of having a career going towards there. I've always been a worker first. I can't help but feel that I should be working more. But I've also noticed that, as I get older, I do feel more comfortable. I can't stress enough that I love my hometown. I grew up in the Bay Area, grew up in a small town, but moved to a city larger than it was in my life.
I'm not too familiar with the building, but I don't feel like I'll be working in an office space for my entire life. It's a very cozy building. Maybe I'll get a promotion and be able to go back to my hometown and live comfortably, but that's just my imagination. I'm not sure what I want to do with my life after life here in the states.
It's not like I want to move back to the Bay Area, I just want to live in the city and not the other way around. I'm just not sure what to do with my life post-bud Lightfoot.
I'm a stable work, but I think there's more to it than that.
-----
SonicXtreme: then you have no business starting from 0 to 100.
-----
compo: I would be happy with just taking a vacation to visit to my family and living out of my car or whatever.
-----
entremet: I don't live anywhere outside the Bay, but I'm a pretty regular traveler. I'm 34 now.

~!~UNC Coach Larry Fedora Accused Of Sexually abusing Young Men

JK-Money: AUNC Coach Larry Fedora Accused Of Sexually abusing Young Men
EXCLUSIVE: The NCSC has released a statement corroborating their story:
-----
JK-Money: True, obviously UNC could have done something but Jesus Christ.
-----
Valkrai: It's disgusting that a university so senior about their job to even have a sexual assault allegation against someone so disgusting is a UNC school.
-----
El Topo: The NCSC statement is so bad it's unreal. Distracted and emotional.
-----
DukeBlue: This has been a known for a while.
-----
LionPride: Wtf
-----
The Albatross: I'm not even sure how to feel about this. It's just very, very disappointing.
I don't think I've seen any other corroboration. I think it's a very small number of young men that were accused, and it's just another few people that were clearly sexually abused.
-----
RolandGunner: That doesn't surprise me in the slightest. They are athletes, and were hired for the purpose of sexual abuse and exploitation. Furthermore, that doesn't make it not suspect. That does not mean they were guilty.
-----
Valkrai: College sports is a whole other ballgame.
-----
DrFunk: 100 times I'm not even sure how to feel about this

Halo 2: I'm in a bit of pain, just had a bad pain in my leg, I have big hands and my hands are shaking easily, I hate it.
Is there a good place to order/buy a pet at petco?
What do you recommend Era?
-----
Lost: Buy a hug dog
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Buy a dog.

Silentpuppet: I'd like a dog.

Halo 2: I'm a gay penguin

====================
~!~What is your favorite Star Wars Anime?

Sephzilla: I mean, Star Wars is not quite the same as it is to anime, but it certainly is the epitome of well-rounded in entertainment. The vast majority of it is based on "fantasy adventure" with fantasy characters, but there are a few anime that are actually more detailed and elaborate than that.
One of my favorites is Code Geass Deel, that is more like "what the hell do I have to do with this and Aladdin's life?" and more of a "monster-based anime that's about finding pieces of all three. What the heck is that thing called a anime?"
Another one I feel like is something from Japan- it's called "Rokie Babish," which for some reason is something you'd hear people talk about as a kid, and it's a live-action series set in Japan. I'm a big fan of the original anime, and the last thing I wanted was for a show that changed the way anime is run.
What are the best and the most recent anime that you have watched?
-----
Rackham: Dragon Ball Super is pretty fucking awesome.
-----
Brock Reiher: Adult swim is pretty great for the most extreme thing you can do
-----
Sephzilla: I haven't seen the original, but now I'm curious as to what the dub is
-----
Hydrus: Gotta be honest, I don't know how to quantify what the dub is. The original is so fucked up and its original characters are hilariously OP, but:
Kamehameha
Yubel (the main character)
Ocarina of time
-----
Sephzilla: This is a pretty comprehensive list
-----
TheChuggernaut: I honestly thought Rokie was the only anime I'd ever watch
-----
SJRB: I'm not sure how I missed the anime part of the list.
The original is just awful, and I couldn't accept how much worse it is to watch it.
-----
Dale Copper: Guts and the original characters are alright.
-----
Cantaim: I don't know if it's the last anime I saw but I've seen Star Wars a bunch lately and I'm not the biggest fan of the original trilogy. I'm guessing the new series will be awful and it had a good ending
====================
~!~Best horror films of all time?

Deleted member 1258: I've recently been rewatching The Witch and the Ward and I'm pretty torn on where and how it should be viewed.
The Witch and the Ward is the scariest film I've ever watched, and it holds up amazingly well.
I'd put The Witch over the whole Michael Moore film and I'd probably say The Wailing over The Thing.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: The Thing
-----
Deleted member 1258: It has one of the scariest films I've ever seen, and it's a fucking dumb film.
-----
Mona: It's about as good as the movie it's from
-----
Mona: and the movie by Peter Jackson is pretty bad
-----
Hank Hill: The Thing.
-----
jon bones: It's a masterpiece, and has one of the scariest films I've ever seen.
The Thing has only two good parts, that's for sure.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I have never seen The Witch, but I have seen The Thing.
The Thing is one of my favorite films ever, and I loved the Witch when it came out.
-----
StuBurns: The Wailing is the scariest film I've ever seen.
The Thing is a weird movie, but it's still one of my favorite films of all time.
-----
ChrisJSY: The Witch and the Ward

~!~Is the concept of the "credentials" a weird thing for the right?

Z-oo31: Pretty simple.
You're a security contractor working for a major company, which has experience in cyber defense/insignia, software-related, etc.
The company is also a pension plan, which is basically some sort of tokenized check ins to the company.
I want to get into that, but I'm an idiot who doesn't really understand how the concept of "work experience" and "certs" work.
-----
siddx: No.
-----
CrazyDude: Nope not at all.
-----
TarpitCarnivore: Nope.
-----
NineConsonants: It’s a dumb theory.
-----
BDS: It's not.
-----
Z-Beat: It's not a dumb concept either
-----
The Albatross: Depends on what you're thinking about as far as security in general, but it's not a weird concept.
-----
Deimos: No.
-----
hateradio: It's not.
The only reason it's a weird concept is that some people think it's stupid.

====================
~!~The Emperor of Porn

lidmat: I'm talking about the Emperor of YouTube fame.
The Emperor of YouTube is a well-regarded former Austrian porn star.
He is, at best, a straight up jackass.
He is also, at worst, a vile misogynist.
His views are also not acceptable to anyone.
I'm not here to shit on his views, I'm here to talk about his views on women and men.
He's called the Orange Emperor.
The Orange Emperor of Porn
The orange Emperor of all things.
As a Singaporean I find his views extremely insulting and misogynist.
There are, of course, many other great things about him, such as his love of cats and busses, for example, but watching the video below, I felt like discussing both elements of his personality was a little strange.
The video is only about a year old, so I thought I'd toss the orange one out for all to see.
-----
FairyEmpire: What is with the alt right?
-----
Vincent Alexander: I think he's just a really angry guy who loves to do racist things and views that are against the progressive direction of the right.
-----
Brock Reiher: I don't understand the Alt Right. He's just a really angry asshole
I'm sorry I'm just at a loss for words
-----
Dook's Revenge: What's with the alt-right?
-----
Polymerization: this is a terrible video. I'm sorry this video is on the wrong place.
-----
davepoobond: He's been around for longer than that.
-----
cdyhybrid: He's a piece of shit who likes to do racist things.
His views are a danger to society
-----
davepoobond: Yeah, I hate him for it. I think he's a danger to society, but I don't know how he's doing any harm.
-----
Dishwalla: He likes to be racist, but I'm not sure he's not contributing to society negatively
-----

====================
~!~What's the first song that helped you get over your fear of heights?

Thewonandonly: I've always been a sucker for this song and I'm an idiot.
The chorus is about a college student and that's exactly what it is. I'll just leave it here because it's the first song that really made me feel like I needed to say something.
-----
Fat4all: my fear of heights
-----

Dishwalla: I slept on this song for years
I slept on Shania Twain
-----
Crissaegrim: It's a Beatles song, right?
-----
Rad Bandolar: It was a song about a cop. It was about a guy coming home from work because he had to see his girlfriend...
-----
Tence: I wish I could say it helps me overcome my fear of heights.
-----
Wackamole: Pretty sure that's about the song.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I love it

====================
~!~I'm in the market for an open-back jacket

TheFallenSaboteur: I'm guessing this is a thing but I'm curious as to the average run-time on a jacket that will last me for two weeks. I've read that it has a longer run-time than a regular pair of pants. Personally, I prefer a more casual run-time though.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: It's a classic classic.
-----
louiedog: It's a classic classic.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: It's something I've been looking for.
And I'm pretty into the material I was using for my pants!
-----
Fat4all: its a classic classic, i wish i could let my pants do all the work
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Huh. I know what I'm wearing right now.
-----
Grym: it's a classic classic. It's a perfect day to get some work done.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I'm wearing thin cotton pants at the moment so I'm not sure how it will hold up to my 4-pack of pants I'm wrapping around my legs.
-----
Cantaim: If you want more ideas on what to buy then this thread is valuable. I'd recommend trying to find something that doesn't cost that much.
-----
Elynn: It's hard to find a jacket that doesn't look like J-Day tier dank.
-----

====================
~!~The new "I'm not racist" policy

Autodidact: It's true. The original policy was bullshit.
And no, it doesn't apply to white people.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'm not going to say it.
-----
Mammoth Jones: If you're gonna be racist, you're going to be racist.
-----
Spenny: What an odd one of responses.
-----
Volimar: I'm surprised they're using the term "White fragility" at all.
-----

~!~Game of Thrones 8th season sets up three year ending and creates an anticipation that cannot be washed away

Teh Hamburglar: It’s crazy how much time has passed for the finale. I remember being in tears when I read the post about the final season coming.
-----
Omegasquash: After the first year, it becomes more exciting each year.
-----
Platy: I mean in theory because every season is ending in a year.
But in practice if the next one is the last, then the whole thing can only become depressing like every other year in the life of the author
-----
Dennis8K: I can't believe it is 8 years since the last season.
I hope Joffrey's coming back for season 8.
-----
Shugga: How long till they shut the whole thing off again ?

Drewton: I hope it ends well

The Gunslinger: I'm sure that's the end of most of the story, but I'm just curious.

MasterVampire: What a stupid way to end the series

~!~Incels, Is there a way to turn this into an anime?

Vex: I've been watching anime for a while now, and I don't know how to turn this into an anime. 
I'm talking about the "it's your fault if you don't like this anime" mentality that revolves around online discussions and the idea that women are "predisposed" to be brights because they don't conform to expectations. 
I've seen a lot of anime these days (even as a straight anime fan), and I'm not really sure if I'm just getting into it. I don't know if I'm just following the "trap" mentality, or if I'm simply doing it for the sake of it. 
But, I think I've really come to the point where I wish that "IT'S YOUR BITCHES IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT" would stop. 
I know there's a lot of discussions online about it, and I'm not really sure if it's just the forum's "bitch people who say they don't like it" or if there are more fundamental aspects of it that have to stop me from enjoying it. 
What do you think?
-----
Dio Over Heaven: It's been that way for a long time, and it's never really won an audience. It's definitely not an anime, and you're only getting one ending--you're never gonna see it. So, I think it's a matter of familiarity and there's only so much you can do with a subject if you don't like it.
-----
Joe Shlabotnik: I don't know if the anime will be the same when you're finished, but I think there's only so much you can can can can change the tone of the story in a short period of time.
-----
Einchy: I don't know if you have the ability to digest anime for 10 years, but I feel like you're going to have to start thinking about the tone of the anime in the next decade when you get older.
-----
Eros: I just watched a shitty anime.

~!~Your Controversial City/Town: Birmingham, Alabama

Andrew Korenchkin: I've been thinking about Birmingham for a while. It's probably my favorite city in the U.S. and one of the few cities to have a diverse population. The city is also large and growing at a rapid pace, which is why I was thinking of calling it something else.
I want to make a similar thread for smaller cities, but I would also like to hear about the larger cities that you've never been and have your own identity.
Bally: Your city, and maybe your town too.
Ediston: Three people from Ediston have given me my soul by taking over the town. I'm from the south part of the county and I'm from the city ofiston and I can say I'm quite happy with that. I have a few quirks and I like to explore. I've been to a ton of places which have diverse populations too. I've also met a few new people from the city of Ediston, but I'm not sure I've met the entire population of Ediston.
-----
Mulciber: I'm from the south part of the county and not the city of Ediston. I'm a bit of a urban planner (my last two terms were certs) and I've heard a million and a half stories of people being urban planners who did not get the chance to plan and create urban areas.
Anyway, I'm from the south part of the town and I'm a resident ofiston.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I'm a resident of the south part of the town and I've been living in the south part of town for a long time.
-----
H.Protagonist: I'm from the south part of town and I'm from the city of Ediston, in what's become known as the "Red Cliff" in the state of Iowa. I'm nice, but not quite above the average.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I'm from Oregon, and I don't mind it. It's just a nice little town.
-----
Power of Sparda: I'm from the south part of town and I've been living in the south part of town for about ten years now.

~!~How do you deal with a low self esteem?

TheFallenSaboteur: I've been having a difficult time finding a name for my general self esteem and I've recently been diagnosed with it's own manifestation. It's been so hard to find a word for it. I'm attempting to find a word that describes the helplessness I feel in the midst of my greatest fears. I don't know what to give others. I'm having trouble finding a word for my most basic fears which is what I am looking for.
I'm a quiet 28 year old guy with a quiet, shy and occasionally jittery nature. I'm not particularly artist or film-making good looking but I have a low sense of humour and I don't like to be challenged. I'm also not a very good social or political person but I do have a few Twitter followers and I'm a relatively easy person to work with.
I'm looking for anyone who might have some common ground here and a positive aspect to me aspect. I'm not looking for a high level of self esteem but a measure of being a good person. I'm not looking for perfection or being perfect but I'm always struggling with what I want and I feel trapped in this self image of myself. I am seeking out the things that I truly believe in and get frustrated with myself when I don't get it or even try.
I've been diagnosed with my "I'm depressed" label for a long time and I've been trying to get it removed from my profile but it hasn't really caught on. It feels like I am constantly being compared to myself and that I am actually doomed. I'm constantly worried when I am alone and it feels like I am doomed to be alone forever. I also see myself as the poster child of our society and I see myself as a product of our society but that I am pretty much a product of it and I don't really want to be there. I also see myself as a poster child for the problems in our community but that I am just not welcome here. I am lucky that my mother is not a part of that and I'm not going to get her to accept that. I'm not going to get myself bullied here because I'm not bullied. My most important priority is the well being of the people who I love and support.
I have a lot of other issues that I'm struggling with but I'm hoping that at least ultimately I

~!~Maclean has been jailed for inciting racial violence

Number of Completion: Thought this was long enough in the tooth to remind me of something I had from the old thread - the term "alt-right" is a dangerous poison to the development of our society. Mural sections of the forum have been titled with alt-right connotations for example. I'm glad he seems to have been caught, but I hope his sentence will be a deterrent for racists and extremists alike.

Elitist1945: I just got done with Netflix's "Begbie," and I want to watch it on some streaming device, but then I realize I haven't had an actual movie in five years. I need to watch it at my own pace, without getting distracted. I know I'm not for everyone, but I'm trying to see if there's a way for somebody to suggest something, in addition to the obvious "what's the best way to watch it?".
-----
amusix: On Netflix.
-----
Ultima_5: I'd love to watch it on a streaming service. I know it's an older movie, but why wait until it's on blu ray?
-----
GrapeApes: VHS or Blu Ray?
-----
AlteredBeast: VHS is probably the easiest way to get around digital rights, but for $10 I would watch it on a streaming service.
-----
PopsMaellard: VHS? VHS movies are available on iTunes for $10 a year, and they are all available on every platform in the world. VHS + Digital are like $20 a year.
-----
Elitist1945: I'd love to have a VHS. I'm not even a big movie buff or anything. Just a casual movie buff.
-----
Dennis8K: VHS? VHS movies are 5/5 on iTunes.
-----
super-famicom: VHS or Blu Ray?
edit: nvm, it's Blu Ray.

Powdered Egg: Ask your internet provider to let you do it.

jcs: Google "download this movie offline" or install a VPN to your PC and you should be good.

TheBeardedOne: I have a couple Netflix movies (Maniac, Stranger Things, Logan) on Prime Now.
I don't know what's the best way, but I'd love to have a VPN option.

You can search for a specific movie release and also the name of the package.
Browse by date and genre.

TheFallenSaboteur: I just finished the whole season and I've only seen scenes/episodes once so I thought I'd give it another shot. I'm going through the other half of season 2 now along with the first part of season 1 and for the most part it works well enough.
I'm still trying to soak it in, but I'm just kinda... amazed that the show is still going. I had no idea Fumika as the main character was completely blown away I think? And the characters in particular were so wonderfully designed. The animation was just wonderfully impressive and the characters were so well drawn.
I've watched pretty much throughout the original run so I can't comment on the quality of the show at all but I'm curious as to what other people's thoughts on the show are? I'm not expecting to see anything too groundbreaking about it, but I'm interested in what people's perceptions of it are.
Edit: Two people here from different countries who can't be bothered to read the subtitles. I didn't realize it was an anime.

I was just watching the first episode last night and I loved it. I get what the realist was about but I hated how the characters were so monotone. The guy with the bee guy is my favourite.

Parenegade: I just got a light theme on my phone, and I like it.
I'm open to trying new themes, so I thought I'd ask if anyone here has tried this before and if there's some good tutorials to get started.

====================
~!~Do you use a Smooc on your phone?

Bman94: I've been thinking about this question for a while. My wife has a Pixel 3 that she uses on the watch face. She doesn't use the phone that much anymore (she uses her smartphone for household stuff and video games) and she never uses it. I've seen people say to check if their phone is doing well. You can check and see if your phone is doing something.
For example, I recently saw someone say to not to buy a phone unless it is on battery. I don't think you need to pay attention to what it is doing. I've seen people use it to play a prank on the car. I don't think it is doing anything but catching on fire or doing a cover image. 
Do you use your phone for stuff on your watch?
-----
Taki: I use my phone on a daily basis.
-----
Novoitus: yes I do too
-----
KojiKnight: What about a phone under an hour!
-----
Dishwalla: my phone, I don't really use it much at all. I just use my watch face, face ID, GPS, GPS bar and my browser
-----
Kthulhu: Yes.
-----
FTF: I use my watch on the phone every now and then. And yes I use it on and off.
-----
Aquavelvaman: I use my phone on the phone every now and then yes I do. I don't have a watch face, and I don't want to put it on the phone while at work
-----
Brock Reiher: I use my phone on the phone every now and then.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Yes I do. I don't need a phone for work.

~!~How do you handle a day drinking with friends and family?

John Doe: It seems like every day drinking with friends and family is just going to get worse. 
I have a group of 7 friends and some are off drinking, I have a group of 4 friends and some are drinking, I have a group of 3.
How do you handle it? 
How do you handle your hangovers? 
What's your take on it?
-----
shnurgleton: The only drinking I do is in the evening so I'm not responsible for a long night at the bar or a night of drinking.
-----
Cocolina: I don't drink for fun, and I don't drink for the fun of others. My friends drink to feel accepted, and it's mainly us.
-----
Cocolina: I don't drink for fun. I drink for the real social stuff, like group discussions, consuming media and so on. If I want to talk about something, I'll usually just say "talk about something else" and leave the conversation moving at some point.
-----
Ebullientprism: I am an alcoholic but I always drink. I don't drink for the sound of discussion. I drink to feel accepted because I like the other person and so on.
-----
Brock Reiher: I don't drink for the sound of conversation. I drink to feel that I'm listening to my own thoughts. Not for the sound of anyone's thoughts.
-----
Sowrong: As others have said, I have no responsibility in this world for what people say/do online. I never drink, I never have to feel ashamed.
-----
Shugga: I drink because I hate the constant stream of drunk friends.
I admit it but I also kinda drink because I feel no shame in drinking.
-----
BAD: I don’t drink for the sound of the discussion because I’m drunk and don’t want to lose my shit

~!~Is there a way to watch Youtube Player from your PC?

WeAreStarStuff: I've never used youtube from my PC, but I've been debating about getting a Shield TV. I'm not sure if there is a way to watch Youtube from my PC, but I think I want to try. If there is a way to watch Youtube from my PC using a PC-specific computer that's just as good, or at least better, than the PC-specific computer that's running Youtubeplayer?
-----
Krejlooc: I use a Roku for streaming, and I've never used a Chromecast (obviously my PC is set to the TV).
-----
Krejlooc: I had to get a Shield TV box because my old Roku used to have a "download" error when trying to download a Youtube video. I'm using an Nvidia Shield TV, but I'm using the PS4 app on my Shield TV.
-----
bangai-o: Why do you need a Chromecast for streaming?
-----
Krejlooc: Because I have a PC with a Roku Streaming Stick I'd consider buying, because I have an Android phone.
-----
Krejlooc: I have an Android phone, too, but I don't have a Chromecast cord-cast.
-----
Krejlooc: I use the cord-cord player from Amazon, and I don't have a Chromecast cord-cord player, so I just use the cord-cord player.
-----
Sulik2: I have a Shield TV, I just prefer the built in options for Youtube since I can just use my phone/desktop/access YouTube from my PC.
-----
Krejlooc: I have two screens, a desktop and a laptop with a few bookshelves. Both have a Roku Premier+ remote, and a Fire TV box.
I don't have a Chromecast cord-cord or an Apple TV (right now), but I use a remote control on the laptop and use my PC for streaming, like a Netflix/Hulu remote.
-----
skeptem: I just use my phone to stream from my PC to my TV.

~!~Favorite songs from Television shows/movies

Squarehard: Here's a handy list of television shows and movies that have iconic songs that have ties to their source material.
Some of mine, such as Game of Thrones, have iconic song songs that have a powerful/wirking/announcement attached to it, while others, such as The Walking Dead, have iconic song that has a much more subdued and more pop-tastic tune, such as the opening song for season 1 of Walking Dead.
I won't go ahead and list every show or movie that I ever watched, because the list would be too large for most people, but I will include a few shows and movies that I feel are iconic songs from television or movies.
Note, this list excludes shows and/or shows with iconic music.
Note 1 - I am not listing any TV series/movies with iconic music. I am just talking the movies, which are not included in this list.
Note 2 - I am not listing any TV series or movies with iconic music. I am just talking the movies, which are included in this list.

~!~Am I being too harsh on this movie?

VCFL: I'm leaving the theatre tonight and so far it seems like this film is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It's a leaner western with a more comedic tone than this typical western. It's a drama about what life could be like for a group of people in modern day China. I don't get what's wrong with it. I'm being harsh on this movie.
What I think
First of all, the real reason I made this thread was because I read about this film previously and it's nothing new. Still, I don't get why people are saying it's a masterpiece of Western cinema. I think it's a very tense and well acted drama with a lot of heart. It's about a guy who's stuck in a time loop. Quite a leaner movie.
What I do get
-----
HStallion: I'm not sure a movie could be any more accurate to the source material without resorting to some questionable translations or translations added in by some people that just don't make sense to the audience.
-----
Travo: No.
-----
Shugga: Yes
-----
nsilvias: Not sure if you're being too harsh on this movie or not.
-----
Fantastapotamus: I think you are being too harsh on this movie
-----
Rackham: No it's called Samurai
-----
Koukalaka: I'm not sure.
-----
shnurgleton: maybe it's because it's a comedy

Pein: This movie is a joke about China.

Schmidt also mentioned that the parties would work out their differences after the end of the DACA talks.

DMczaf: I love this man.
-----
Khanimus: I like that he's not just playing the audience, he's playing himself.
-----
The Almighty Tria: John Cena is a man of incredible physical presence for his age, great character, amazing charisma, and an amazing face for whatever reason.
His face is so fucking weird, but his performance is so fucking amazing, that I don't know if I can take this guy seriously as being good.
-----
The Almighty Tria: Well he's got a lot of personality, he's got a lot of swagger, and he's got a good role. It's all charisma. Cena is great.
-----
DMczaf: I mean, he was cast as a dumb bumbling fool.
He's played himself.
-----
Strafer: That was fun.
I'm all for Cena.
-----
sibarraz: Why is Cena playing himself though, he's so good in that role

-----
Razgriz-Specter: Cena is great in the role.
The Rock is great in the role, I love him in the role.
Cena is just a good actor.

Anyone else? I would love to learn more about this program, and if you have any questions that are relevant about this, feel free to DM me.
-----
thesoapster: I'm not Canadian myself, but when I'm at a Canadian store and there's really little to purchase I'll go ahead and grab some shovels from there. As for shovels, it's just a heads up, but it's a pretty big payout to get a really good shovel.

AxeVince: I did this in my last snowman. It was amazing.
I brought my wife and her best friend apron apron. Both snowblowers. They were really impressed with the snow.
-----
Lakeside: Snowman traps are cool.

Tethered Penguin: Yes.
I'm leaving a 3-star review because I'm bored at work and couldn't stomach the time to work something else.

FUME5: No.

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: Yes
But like others have said, I cant stand them. I do find them to be a little annoying sometimes, especially if I read them after I finished a big battle.
Has a great many people that arent really smart and just want stupid reviews. And also I cant imagine that they want to get rid of that way of reading stuff.

It's a little early on but I wanted to share it as someone who has never seen it before so I just wanted to give it as much attention as possible. Also I didn't realize that it has become a cult classic like Black Mirror.
Tyler, the Creator is a comedic series that focuses on dark and strange situations in which you have a dark side and dark side of humanity mixed with light and shadow mixed with each other
If you haven't seen it yet and you have you looking forward to it then you owe it to yourself to spread the word. 
Where to even buy episodes?
-----
Jon Carter: I remember when this show first aired, I watched a bunch of episodes. I think it was all in the Amazon Prime app.
-----
Kazoku_: I remember watching a couple episodes and one of the standouts was "... ten thousand dollars...". I remember thinking "... weird... but i'll keep it light side xD"
-----
Gouty: A couple of the episodes are on Amazon and they are available to watch for free on Hulu. The others are on YouTube and it's on Prime.
-----
Punished Snaku: I only watched one episode but the premise of the series is promising.
-----
Gouty: Yeah I forgot that they had a season 2 coming up. They changed the name of the show to Black Mirror after they won silverware awarded by the authoritarian government.
-----
Punished Snaku: I don’t think it’s a high quality show, but it’s on YouTube.
I like how they are mixed up in some places. One group is travelling to another planet while the other is in a dystopian future with the mind of a ruthless billionaire.
The twist is that some of the people in the dystopian future have a dark secret society called the Black Mirror. The leader is a mesmerist called the Black Mirror, one that sends messages through the mind of techno-merschists to those who would betray them...

Why are there so many "we're not real nazi, get out of here with us!" posts from the hundreds of lurkers on the old forum?
-----
famikon: you don't have to be a real nazi to be a real nazi.
it's just that most nazis don't have a real stance on what they believe.
That's why they're "nazi" in the first place. (Besides being nazi's)
-----
Hektor: I think it's common knowledge that incel are the same people who think the Incel community should be called "nazi".
Incel can be forgiven, they're just not a real nazi, or a real nazi, and the thread about the Incel community being called "nazi" is a fair call.
-----
famikon: In the latest years, it seems that the old forum has had a lot of "movement" threads dedicated to hating on real nazis. 
But this isn't the only place that has lots of "movement" threads, we already had this thread about hating on Jackass incels.

FairyEmpire: I don't think this is a thing outside of gaming communities. I think it's just something that's just normal for the internet. People just don't want to be associated with the shit.

~!~Drinking to get the right mix of vitamins and minerals, what works best?

Tideas: Quick background: I drink a lot of water. I typically have about 30-40 mg of vitamin C in my diet, I drink about 12 - 15% of it daily, but the problem is I get less than 1% of my daily vitamin C. I was trying to figure out if I drink too much or too little (or both), because the Vitamin C I get doesn't really do much to help with my blood pressure (though I do feel better when I drink more). I'm thinking it's down to the mineral part of things.
I'm curious if there's a specific kind of mineral supplement that I should be drinking, and if so, how do you find it.

M52B28: I'm sorry for not having him as a co-worker. Hope you get the help you need.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Mine happened a few months ago but I was told to smile and laugh but put your face towards the back of the room so you can get a nice concentration.
-----
Thewonandonly: Oh shit I’m so sorry for not having him as a co-worker lol. I’ve had strokes before but this is the first time I’ve had a professional stroke. Hope you get the help you need.
-----
Whitemex: My boss had a stroke a few years back and it ended with him getting a nice one stroke. It was awful.
-----
Saganator: No. I had a doctor's appointment about 15 mins away from the end of the Dr because my gallbladder was a little shit. He got better and walked around with me and told me to stay out of the bloods and stuff for a few days to clear up the blood and let it drain off.
-----
Thewonandonly: He was the one who was the one to have it. I can see how you might feel bad for him and he did it himself lol.
-----
Rangerx: Nah it's bad. Not really a stroke that bad but a lot of stuff from the beginning would start to clog the blood/bup in the next couple days or weeks.
But I still stroke regularly.

~!~Spotify (Premium) is doing so great again.

molnizzle: I just started dropping Spotify Premium music streaming today from my phone. I'm using it exclusively for listening to Spotify on my PS4, PC, PC, PC with Bluetooth enabled, and it works flawlessly.
I've never used Spotify so I'd really like to get it again, but I don't see myself dropping it.
-----
Richter1887: Woooooow. I love it.

nihilence: Now I'm getting the Spotify premium for a second.

~!~Someone stole my food and it's fucking poison

Wag: I've had some of my food delivered to a McDonald's a few months back. I've been pretty excited for the food but when I walked out the door they locked the front door and parked their cars on the lawn. 
The food was left in my pantry and I thought to myself, "You see, I'm not getting any of this." I tried to call them but they couldn't find it. I was pretty pissed and wanted to move as quickly as I could and called the cops. 
The food was left in my pantry and I'm pretty sure they found it and are trying to get rid of it. I bought my food from a call center and it's fucking poison. 
I think I'm going to have to get a lawyer.
-----
DHARMA PUNX: I'm just gonna sit here and hope it's not an accident
-----
Hollywood Duo: Dude just had his food stolen.
-----
HylianSeven: That's fucked up. That's fucked up.
-----
Wag: So I didn't know the location, so I parked my car and left my food.....and...
-----
EchoChamber: Sounds like a person with ulterior motives.
-----
B_Spades: I mean, if it was a mistake I would be concerned but...
I almost dropped out of college when I moved out but I saw that peoples house was too far away so I decided to go get some groceries to help cover it, so I could get some food there and let them know the owner is gone so I can get some food from the deli because it's gone bad by the time I get back.
But you know what, I'm not going to sue so much as I can I guess?
-----
thewienke: I had a piece of cardboard come loose from my pantry and it fucking poison.
I know they keep some of the food out but it was a really bad smell so I thought it was gonna be a horrible smell.
Thankfully it turns out the smell was just s regular stuff.
-----
DJGolfClap: I'm not too sure why they'd go that route, obviously.
I guess it's an aesthetically pleasing joke, though.
-----
Wag: That's really tasteless.

~!~I just saw the upcoming(ish) movie "Ace Ventura". Anyone else seen it?

TheAbsolution: Saw it earlier, it's pretty good. I liked the ending much more than the beginning. Better than 99% of the original film.
I loved the ending, but hated the way it turned out. Kinda cheesy, but I'm not into the "That's what's cool about helicopter parenting" kind of parenting.
Thoughts? Seen the trailer and the reviews have been nice.
-----
molnizzle: It was good.
-----
AdamT: I still have to see the movie before I die.
-----
Wackamole: About time I saw it when I was younger. But not now.
-----
Smurf: good
-----
Smurf: it's a good movie, but not a good movie without a lot of heart.
-----
PanzerKraken: It's good, but not a good movie.
-----
Khanimus: I mean it's a good movie.
-----
Hollywood Duo: It’s also definitely not a good movie.
-----
Yerba_Sutra: Not bad, but not particularly great either. The only times I really liked it, and it still holds up really well is when I first watched it when I was a teen, and it's still good, but not great.

~!~How do you deal with dealing with a hangover?

BAD: First I want to say I’m sorry for sounding like a rant, but I’m not a poster. I think it’s time for a conversation with this person. Why is it that we are strangers to you when you seem to be having a ball while I was asleep? How do you deal with a hangover when you seem to be having a hard time with your other half?
If you have the flu, do you take a walk in the dark?
-----
Gravy Boat: I don't. I just take a walk in the dark.
I don't drink too much caffeine, and I rarely take any.
-----
Dishwalla: I took a walk in the dark in elementary school. Laid off a month down.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't drink too much, but I get a glass of water in the afternoon. I'm also light years away from vomiting on Halloween weekend.
-----
BLEEN: Walk in the dark, I don't drink that much.
-----
CormoranStrike: I'll take a walk in the dark. A walk in the dark isn't fun, I haven't been through any in years.
-----
lunarworks: Yes, I've had a hangover a few times. I get a couple of pints of cough medicine a day, and I rarely drink.
-----
Travo: I don’t drink too much, but I get a couple pints of Bloody Mary every Halloween.
-----
Bakercat: Walk in the dark, never drink it until I get sleepy.

Apollo: I don’t drink too much. I get drunk pints of water in the afternoon and on weekends when I’m really busy.

~!~What is the best time for a single person to be single?

Kyra: I was walking past a group of family members and I see this comment on FB about a single person coming to the house and they're talking about their 5 year old daughter. I thought maybe they were single but apparently they're married and they've been single forever. I'm thinking to myself it's like a sitcom where the entire family makes up their mind and they're all single. 
You heard this story
-----
Taki: This is awful. You'd think a show about this subject would be more approachable.
-----
SugarNoodles: I mean, it depends if they're just in it to get rich or to clean out.
If they're just in it to get money, why not?
-----
nsilvias: got a few bucks left, I'm going to get a car and a house.
-----

HyGogg: The world is a weird place, we can learn a lot from other cultures, but I wouldn't call it a sitcom.
-----
Hollywood Duo: It’s when it’s being used to make money.
-----
Tbm24: I'd imagine it to be a sitcom back in the 90s.
-----
Kyra: What? That's not something I would have expected the father of the child to say.
-----
Jbourne: It's not a sitcom. Marge is married to the son, and they're doing it together.

Coraline Jones: I was going to a Men's Fashion Show in NYC, but I decided to go with a lighter color. I don't usually go to formal events, so I bought these!
I'm wearing joggers right now.

Cyanity: I've never really been a minimalist guy. Can't stop reading lines in my head.

Vilix: We need to get rid of plastic straws.
-----
Nepenthe: Can't say I know of the plastic berries growing on them, but I do know that anyone who buys them is very likely going to be a meth addict.
-----
Cation: What a shitty thing
-----
Powdered Egg: Won't they take the Strawberries to the FDA right?
-----
The Kree: The FDA should be shut down.
-----
THE GUY: Nah, they're fine. I've really been missing out on a good amount of years of that plastic straw.
-----
Vilix: Yeah, that would be ideal. Just get a filter and a filter with a flexible one that doesn’t break the screen.
-----
Chamaeleonx: Amazing. Thanks for sharing this.
I also love them but I would prefer a full strawberry then :(

~!~Do you think it's okay to not know the first thing that comes to your mind after you look at the headline?

The internet is a scary place for learning, especially for people who are curious about the world. So I find myself wondering if I am being watched and if I should just ignore it or be patient. I think it is important for us to be educated about this stuff and to be able to process what is going on in our lives. I also think that it is important that we are constantly learning new things. 
Do you feel like it is okay to not know anything about a subject which may include:
- The meaning of a word in a story in which nothing really happens, eg. "this" is incorrect, "this train is going to do or come to do", "it's a promo for something, something good, whatever". 
- The origin of a sentence in a book. Eg. "This is a story written by the great Marcel account of an old friend who died in Book 3 of The Fire Next Week". 
- Clothing. It seems like a fashion statement but I feel it is most likely tied to the person(s). I know that a black t-shirt and a dark colored dress are acceptable but I feel it is either unnecessary or plain. 
How about you era? Do you think it is okay to not know a thing or to be cautious?
-----
Alucrid: it's ok
-----
Ghos: I'm not saying you aren't watching it, but if you don't watch the video you're absolutely doing it wrong.

I'll watch it if I'm being impatient for entertainment, and I'm not being lazy.

Pankratous: I think it's okay. But I'm being impatient for entertainment, if I'm being concerned with whether the thread will be of any use to me.

CormoranStrike: I mean I don't watch porn, but if I'm not being lazy I'm not getting involved in porn either.

~!~How do you deal with tough love?

SugarNoodles: I'm sorry I can't just post it here but I just had this conversation with a coworker. She had a rough day once and she had other folks close to her hit on her. One of them was a very good looking(we don't consider him that much) college grad, married with kids under 5(he was in a band) so I just carried him in my heart. The other one got really bad and I don't even know anymore. I just want to say that this was a great day. I always thought that this woman was pretty nice and I don't see myself going where she could have gone if I didn't do my job and leave her hanging. But I can't think of an answer. I just want to ask how do you deal with the awful situation that she has taken in. Is it embarrassing or awkward? He's a good looking guy(I've always considered him attractive) and I'm a guy. I'm not saying that she shouldn't be attractive but I'm just wondering how it works out in this situation.
-----
Neezo: I try to avoid discussions that end up with shallow, toxic comments, which lead to many uncomfortable and uncomfortable conversations.
You shouldn't bring it up unless you absolutely have to. I know it comes off as unnatural.
-----
Dook's Revenge: Bullying is no joke.
-----
Platy: Don't bring it up unless you believe it will solve the problem or you want to talk about it but... yes this is bad.
-----
WallSniper: I think it is okay to bring it up if you believe it will make the person take better advantage of you. That is when the conversation really starts to fall apart.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Yes. Stop being so insecure.
-----
WrenchNinja: If it's awkward, don't bring it up, or don't talk to the person.
-----
ArachosiA: I only bring it up for calm and to not get upset.
-----
SugarNoodles: That's a tough one. I can understand the frustration and the need to work through it but you gotta be clear with the other person. Is it not okay to bring it up?
-----
Dook's Revenge: No. That's a lie.

~!~Trump's lawyer launches counter-protester campaign to try to quash 'presidential pardon' of Manafort

fluffydelusions: 
-----
Tovarisc: They're probably going to try to make it more and more difficult for Mueller to get to the meeting, as there's no real way for Trump to pardon him.
-----
LiK: So the shoe box is going to still be on his shoe?
-----
Shoeless: I think Manafort has only 10 days, and even then he'd still be eligible for the pardon, if Mueller reports Manafort's finances are good.
-----
Wilsongt: I'm guessing Manafort has 8 days to leave NY at this point, but if Manafort is found to have Russian money in his campaign I expect Manafort to be put in a ward of the capital city, like in a presidential pardon.
-----
Slayven: Add it to the list
-----
Jombie: He might as well plead not guilty.
-----
Pilgrimzero: Better run around asking the court to convict the bitch.
-----
samoyed: This is why I don't go to the gym.

Yamajian: Manafort is facing charges of tax evasion.

DeeDogg: Yes! It's quite amazing how this service now gives away so much.

~!~What is the most you ever spent on a meal?

Thewonandonly: So I’m in the slightest bit of melancholy. I’m hungry and thirsty and want to eat some good food. I’m thirsty so I can drink one of the cheapest alcoholic creamer bottles I can find. I don’t even know where to start. I’m hungry but can barely get the ingredients for what I’m about to buy. 
This is the food I want to eat:
And this is what I got:
The food looks good but I’m not sure what else I should get. I’m thinking maybe a homemade cheddar cheese tart or mac and cheese from Amazon. I’m also thinking maybe some sort of blue cheese or grilled cheese from a fancy cheese factory. I’m not sure what else I should get either cause I’m hungry but I’m not sure what I could get for what I’m about to buy.
I’m not sure what else I should get either because I’m hungry and want to eat more but I’m not sure what else I could get for what I’m about to buy.
I’m wondering what to get for a price. If I have to keep buying a meal I feel like I’m dragging my feet all the while. What do you all think about me getting a meal for 2 bucks and I’m wondering what to get for that price.
-----
Chivalry: The best meal you can make is one you can bring home with you to share.
-----
Thewonandonly: I just want to state for the record I spend like 2 dollars a week on food. I am hungry. I don’t really care what price you choose I just want to know how much I spend on food. I know I can cook but I am just terrible at cooking.
-----
Thewonandonly: Need to see if there is an app for that. I would like to buy some ingredients to make a burger

Puck Beaverton: I’m in the mood for some good movies to have a good time. I’m not interested in seeing them on the theaters.
I’m in the mood for some good movies to pick up for my wife. We both watched The Mummy and Mrs. Claus, both were good. Mrs Claus is nice and I like it a lot. Mrs Claus is fun but I don’t really enjoy it as much as I would like Mrs Claus. I think it’s more entertaining than the other two. My wife likes The Mummy and I found her enamoured with The Mummy.
My question is this. Where do you go to get the best movies?
-----
Aquavelvaman: It's all down from here.
-----
Platy: It will be on Netflix in Canada for me. Can't say I have the right price plan for movies as the movie theater might be too far in to the plans for the theaters in your area
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'm in the mood for some good movies to watch. I've seen Mummy and Mrs Claus, but have seen both never again. I don't care for it as a recommendation.
I don't want to go to the theaters because I don't know any of the names, but also I don't want to go to them because I know they're good.
-----
StuBurns: Disney has a huge selection of classics.

Heromanz: Bang your head on your tv
Fuck off

CountAntonius: My local movie theater is getting some movies a month for free. They have a selection of movies for 14% of the cost.

I'm in the mood for some good movies to watch. I’m not interested in seeing them on the theaters.

~!~Dealing with persistent hangovers is awful

TheBeardedOne: I've had a hangover for the first time in over a year and I've been suffering through 2 "coughs" per day over the last few weeks. I've had a hangover since 1 January (probably because I ate too much) and I'm pretty sure it started with a work call.
I've had some consistent hangovers and some days have been quite a bit worse than others but I've been waking up in the morning and just not doing anything. I eat, sleep and eat. For days like today I'm just doing nothing but eating and sleeping.
I'm starting to panic and I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do in these situations. I've got anxiety and panic attacks but I don't know what to do. I've had a lot of free time in the last couple of days and I don't know what to do anymore.
It's not healthy to drink alcohol, I've had a lot of free time in the last couple of days and I don't know what to do. I've been having panic attacks but they haven't escalated into panic attacks. I've had a lot of free time in the last two days. I've had a lot of free time in the last two days. I've had a lot of panic attacks.
I've been given medication but I'm just not really doing anything. I don't feel like doing anything and I don't feel like I have enough energy to think about anything. I'm just not really doing anything.
I've got anxiety and panic attacks but I don't know what to do. I've had a lot of free time in the last two days. I've had a lot of free time in the last two days. I've had a lot of anxiety and I don't know what to do.

Coraline Jones: I am an Unknown Chinese Medicine resident and I am feeling really down. I am feeling really anxious and very bad.
I am taking Prozac for the past 2 days and have been in a state of unecalization. I am also taking some Formpal. I am 6'3" and although I have been feeling really tired in the past, I am feeling great.
I don't know anything about the anxiety, but I have never felt this down the rabbit hole so intensely like this before.
I am feeling really tired and when I finally get up and go to sleep I am feeling really heavy. I am very scared of going to bed to sleep and waking up feeling refreshed but I am not having sleep because I am so afraid of waking up feeling so tired or not knowing what's going on.
I am at about 40% insomnia and it feels like I am going through the motions.
I don't know what the hell I am going to do. I went to sleep with a lightbulb light and for the first time in my life I felt really light headed and I am not sure what I am doing.
I am just going to sleep and look at the clock.
I am awake right now but I am really tired and I feel like I can't sleep and I don't know what to do to get better.
I just want to chime in if there is anyone here who has this.

~!~Today I Learned the First Day of Grad School and What I Learned

Hate: So last week I was in high school and I had an English Class in Media Theory. I was getting weird about it and learning different concepts but I was getting the basics down. I was having a class where they showed us clips of videos of people talking and joking around. I was laughing and joking around and laughed. I was having a fun time. The class itself was fun, but the concept of crowds and determination and love for a group of people was a new one.
I had no idea what I was getting into and it was a class where they showed us clips from the last three or four years of my life. I remember the last time I was around a group of kids who thought I was weird for going to the library and watching magazines. I spent the day with my gf who I thought was the same way. She had invited me to her place with her parents and I was in the car with her. I was watching the clips of the last three or four years I was living with my gf and she was talking to me about movies, she was telling me all the time about how she watches her brother sleep and how they never came to visit when I was living with my parents. I was like, what the fuck. The last thing I remember was that if they were in the car driving around the neighborhood there was even a little bit of tension. I guess it was like watching an old sitcom with a slightly more adult bent.
Anyway, I went to visit my parents and they were like, "Oh you were watching this?" and then I was like, you were watching a sitcom, what the fuck. Like you're supposed to be weird, I'm not going to pretend to be weird. I took a random VHS tape and watched this shit. I was like, fuck this shit.

~!~Is there any truth to the claim that being overweight led to the inability to breastfeed?

John Doe: I've been overweight my entire life and I don't know if there's any truth to the claim that being overweight led to being unable to breastfeed leads to being able to breastfeed?
It seems like a pretty big lie, I know.
-----
Mister Saturn: The more interesting question is whether there is any logical reason as to why being overweight led to being unable to breastfeed, the argument being that we actually didn't learn anything new about our being able to breastfeed and we just didn't become attuned to it.
-----
Latpri: So in theory, yes, but how? Not how you feeling each day can help guide your thought process.
-----
captive: All the breastfeeders on Earth are overweight.
-----
jkm23: I'm not crazy. My wife is overweight. She's not overweight. 
I'm a woman. They are all. I don't breastfeed. My wife is 21 years old and still lacks breastfeed. 
I'm here saying that if a man is overweight and can breastfeed, this is a valid argument. Why breastfeed when it's a man?
-----
Blue: I'm not sure I understand.
I would suggest that, if you are overweight and can breastfeed, you should start breastfeeding. Breastfeed as a means that you are not limiting yourself to being breastfed. 
Otherwise, all you need to know is that you are not fat.
-----
jkm23: I do not. I was overweight and I still breastfeed. That is the breastfeeders problem. 
This was a different problem. 
I was middle class white and my breast feeding was pretty 80% women. 
I also had a misdemeanor. 
The breastfeeders are having a bad day.
-----
jkm23: I'm sorry I didn't get it from the article. I'm not 100% sure what I would do with that data. I don't think I'm able to breastfeed myself, but I do think I am in a unique situation that is worth discussing. I do think there is some truth to the claim though.

~!~Why don't they do a single clip show for animated movies?

Liquid Plejades: I don't know why they haven't done it for animated movies, but there was a Nickelodeon movie that was shown on SpikeTV. The premise was that the hero (Johnny) runs through a long, drawn-out road trip filled with twists and turns, in search of a mythical creature they believe to tell our heroes father. The thing is, the journey takes time, and that's fine and all that. The thing about it that I can see is that it's just a short clip show, so they have to pay a premium to make it look as good as possible.
So what are your thoughts? Is this just a weird trend or is there something else I am missing out on?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Why would you want to put a 10 minute long intro to a movie which has an hour long intro?
-----
CoolestSpot: Because it's all cartoons in one form or another
-----
Whitemex: Because it's not in the traditional sense. Why would you want a Canadian hero?
-----
porkproduct: I think it's a more cynical way of saying it's all cartoons in one form or another.
There are some animated films that are genuinely different.
-----
Baconmonk: I think it's pretty silly. For a short intro, you don't have to pay much attention, if at all. But then you have to pay extreme attention to the audio and subtitles.
-----
SolVanderlyn: It's not about the heroes and it's not about the creators. It's about their own form of inspiration and a convenient shorthand for it's own meaning/value.
-----
CoolestSpot: That's true, but I'm just saying its a pretty lame way to say it.

~!~What are your thoughts on the fall season?

nightwatcher: Specifically, what are your thoughts on the season?
Season:
It started off well enough. It's just a part of my day to work and spend time with my wife and we are pretty much always in bed by 2 and it's pretty fun to watch a movie or play games. But then I started getting dark and I don't have a TV so the whole day is dark. It's like a black and white tv show but with a lot of weird colors and things.
What do you think of the season?
-----
Nabbit: I think it's a great show with a lot of good topical jokes. It's also pretty good at depicting the real lives of the people who live in these situations.
-----
shaneo632: I've yet to watch season three but I'm so glad it's on Netflix. I've never felt more tense in a while when I'm watching a show but it's so much fun.
-----
citrusred: It's great. The show is very short and it grows and improves over time with the characters not having to do too much in the same way every episode.
-----
lil jetski: Season 1 is the great season. Season 2 is a shitshow. Season 3 is good but it's still a good show and as a comedy in the vein of The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Mad Men.
-----
B.K.: It's a great show.
The way it's shot and animated has grown over the years.
-----
nightwatcher: I'm currently watching season two and I'm really enjoying it. Season 3 is beautiful though.
-----
MarsipanRumpan: I’ve never had a season as good as this one. I’ll never watch another show that does the same thing (while also being a good television show) because it’s so bad. But season one is the true golden age for me.
-----
Chivalry: Season 1 is great. Season 2 is a shitshow. 3 is great. 4 is a bridge too far to reach the bottom of the pile.
-----
HStallion: I think it's underrated and if you like your show you should keep watching it.

~!~What are your job perks?

MajulaDream: Here is the thread i created to ask the most interesting side of the question. 
I'm curious what the perks of my job are.
-Enters paid sick days, if I get sick enough, I can rest my working hours.
-Job and benefits are more equal than they have ever been, no matter the job.
-Bigger paycheck, not just bonus but overall quality
-Job security, etc
-Job security, however bad, is significantly less of a "must" concern
-Salary increase/average salary, not safety pay
What about bonus? What about benefits?
-----
vypek: Benefits obviously
Being able to have a full time employee is awesome

Salary increase/average salary
Bad news for employers, your name gets lots of job security.

TheGamingNewsGuy: I am going to demonstrate this point in the context of horror movie villains and my question is -Why is it that villains can look like a 4 year old in a horror movie, even as the audience continues to grow older as a society -I am curious if it is by design.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Because they are business men
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: It's not because it's an attempt to be a more mature film but at the same time it's a horror movie
-----
Dishwalla: it's the same reason that the villain in The Dark Knight can't look like a 4 year old
-----
Shugga: Its just the same feeling of horror that they bring to the audience
-----
PatMan: Because it's based on a comic
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I mean it's a horror movie, it's not horror based on a comic.
-----
Mendinso: It's because they're "business men."
-----
Netherscourge: It's just the same feeling as "scary scary comic" movies: They present a scary situation with a scary premise, a scary premise that the audience starts believing in (usually very vague, or too obscure to even be scary) and then they start believing the scary comic gets presented (usually presented in a very weak or bad light).

GustyGardens: Because horror movies don't actually have a good ending. The sad thing about them is that they're usually just told to end.

gforguava: This is going to be a terrible thread, but I don't see how this is better than the original.
The poll is flawed. It wasn't like this is Family Guy with some of the most sketchy stuff. I do remember that one episode the host had a character in one of the earlier episodes sketching out his crush.
I don't think there's anything wrong with a show about fucking with your family, but I don't think this shit is as good as Family Guy.

~!~The myth of the bootheam

Nerfgun: I’ve never seen this before, but I remember watching a show on Netflix called “The Myth of the Bootheam”
I thought it was pretty entertaining. A couple of episodes go into the history of the bootheam and the first attacks on Pearl Harbour. A couple weeks later the crew is on the run after discovering a treasure trove of treasure that they don’t know they’ve found. And just before that they go to Australia and they meet the leader of Australia.
The myth of the bootheam is fascinating. It’s a big ol’ mythology of sorts, since it originated in Greek culture and the pre-modern era. It’s a big ol’ Greek myth, and the major players are all based on the Greek gods. They are both based on the Mighty Macademia and are based on the most powerful heroes of their time (think Ragnarök from Vikings because of his ability to understand himself and his power to do good).
The main players in the show are Sestero, Ogedos Menelaus, and Chanius. They are the new rulers of Australia, overthrowing the previously untouchables New and Old gods. And they are all incredibly powerful. The most powerful of the three is Sestero, who is one of the most powerful people in the world. And he’s a leader of a big group of powerful people.
Chanius is a god of war and nature, who also rules from within Sestero, thus he gets to be the human face of Australia. And also, he is the god of money. He preys on the wealthy to deliver services in the most powerful financial markets.
And the major players are all powerful and powerful ones. Sestero is the most powerful god, he controls all of the major banks and the New World. Sestero controls the New World to a point where Australia is basically screwed, but Sestero controls the world to a point where Australia is essentially screwed, but Sestero is the most powerful god.
Chanius is a god of war, nature, and money. He controls the entire military of Australia during an invasion of Sestero. It plays a crucial role in Australia’s war against the New World. Sestero, through Sestero’s

~!~Do you ever go to the movies or cafes with just one person?

RatskyWatsky: I don't really follow movie going or cafe going, but recently I've been going to both.
The first time was a birthday party for a friend, and I had just bought tickets to an open bar (which is where I got to meet the rest of my friend group). I'm almost a year into my new membership with my friend group, and I'm enjoying the party as well, although I'm having some trouble understanding how we interact.
But the second time is a birthday party for a friend. I've already been there, but I'm having trouble keeping up with it. I'll usually go in between 4-6pm, but I'll go into the cafe early tomorrow and get drinks and food for two nights. I don't know, maybe it's not fun?
-----
FUME5: Not often, but I'm glad you did.
-----
RatskyWatsky: I don't go to the movies as much as I would like, but this is nothing like the parties at the movies.
-----
Aurongel: I usually go to the movies with my SO and I'm pretty chill about it.
-----
Cookie: I go to the movies at least once a month, although on days where I’m traveling I’ll go once or twice a week.
-----
RatskyWatsky: I don't really go to the movies unless I'm with a group of friends or something.
-----
RatskyWatsky: I don't like going to the movies either, because I hate going to the movies and it's just too much stuff for me to handle.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've always felt like this, but I've never been one to go to the movies before. I don't mind going to the movies sometimes for the food and the stories, but it's always too much of a hassle.
My only exception is when I fly to Chicago for the week and am just at the movies all day.

TheBeardedOne: I do the latter, but it's that week that I'm going to the gym.

Deception: I was thinking about buying a car recently but I wanted to be sure I was thorough with myself and not blindly trusting some random celebrity.
I was thinking about buying a new used car when I came across this cover for sale:
Which is more believable? What does it say about the person?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: You're going to come up with a few names for the covers.
-----
Deception: I think the one on the car is a bit of a mystery.
-----
Krejlooc: I think I've seen this one before, and it's something that's fairly "fantastic".
-----
Mr. Sam: I think the one that goes on the front is a bit much. I'd say it's a good idea, but just in case it is really expensive, for people looking to save money, it's probably best to ask the dealer.
-----
Deception: Yeah just feel free to PM me and I'll add you to the thread.
-----
Krejlooc: I've seen this one before. The cover is just a small image that goes on the back. Starting to show up as a small "horoscope image" when I search for it in Sedona.
-----
Deception: For reference, a car dealer I was contacted for this vehicle info said it was likely a dealer only. I feel like I would be stuck with a few names on the covers, but ugh, it's a bad idea if I start asking for too many names.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: It says this car has been used or if I have a good credit if I'm not am I going to transfer to a different place to keep my total credit intact?

Deception: I think you're supposed to ask the dealer if they printed the cover and inquire about the name.

Mr Swine: Thanks, I don’t know if that’s the best way. I think I’ll just buy a second monitor.

UnholyChocolate: It's not exactly cheaper but you can get a free monitor from Walmart with Prime if you're not already going to the store.
Don't go to the shop and go to the monitor to see what they offer.
No I don't want to go to the shop and see what they offer.

TheFallenSaboteur: I've been driving a rental for about two years now and I've finally decided to take the plunge and get a 2017 GT. It's been my single greatest passion, and I'm really excited about the prospect of getting some good muscle to spend my money on. I'm also interested in what the market has to offer in terms of GTs and cars with insane price tags. Anyone have any interesting picks?
-----
TheBeardedOne: My favorite car ever is the 1980s Toyota Tercel, which I believe was a great sporty-caterpillar with AWD and for being driven by a single 18 month old me.
My least favorite car is the Honda Matrix, which I had for a long time.
-----
Granadier: Is the Matrix any better than the Matrix?

Dishwalla: my first car

Porygon: The Matrix because it has a blast and is nice to drive
The Matrix for sure though is a real masterpiece. I needed a new car when my sister needed a new car in the city

SquirrelSr: I've always wanted a BRZ but I never drove it. I'm not a fan of the styling, and I'd like to keep it, but it's not for everyone's taste. I'm pretty car obsessed though, and I've been a bit of a car guy myself.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I'd love to get one of those. I've been eyeing the Matrix since I first drove it, but I want to know if anyone has any recommendations for a used car.
-----
hordak: i would say the Matrix is the most expensive but it's also the most dependable of the ones i have ever driven. i will say the shifter is good and the clutch is good, but i'm not sure about the warranty.

But when I see an existing movie, or TV show, or whatever, I'll usually just wait for the next day/night to catch up. When I watched that new movie or TV show, I didn't really catch it.

AcademicSaucer: Centrist, left-leaning parties in Europe are starting to campaign against the idea of a post-Brexit Britain, leading to a "pure European identity", according to right-wing politicians and activists in Spain.
Spanish right-wing party members and center-left activists are planning a campaign calling for a "pure European identity", inspired by the two decades of the Spanish Right-wing party, in the 1980s.
The campaign description, co-produced by Afrin-Politika, is "a collective effort of several left-wing parties in Spain, aiming to create an identity based on the principles of European identity".
It is based on the principles of the European Union, the European Union and the principles of free movement and national borders.
The idea is to create a mix of identity with the aim of preserving the country’s European identity.
Spanish right-wing activists have attacked the idea in the past, citing the danger of European integration and the failure of successive governments to act against immigration.

~!~How many teeth need to be replaced every year?

Copper: This is a question that I'm starting to get a little fed up. In my teens i'd trimmed my teeth in a week. I just stopped after a couple of years. I've had my carpal tunnel for the past 5 years now. I'd been brushing my teeth every day for over a year now. I've had to do some bloodwork to check the amount and count of cavities and shit..and now my teeth are starting to look like a bag of bricks. With my current insurance, it's not even close to being affordable. How about trading for a dental card from the getgo? I don't know how to feel. I'm just pretty fed up right now. 
How do you guys feel about this?
-----
Zombine: You're going to need a dental tech once you're in this position.
-----
Kasai: It's a big deal. I've been using a dental cleaning service for the past year and a half. Every time I had a root canal, my dentist was the first person to do it, and I felt so bad I almost gave up on treatment. 
But, I also don't drink very much. So I guess, I'm just sick of it all.
-----
Transistor: 3 every year
-----
TheBeardedOne: How many times a year?
-----
TheBeardedOne: I think it depends on the area I'm from, though. And if I had a root canal, how would I go about brushing your teeth every day? I live in the Boston suburbs, and my dentist was an absolute pain to walk around, especially if you're young-as-fuck.
-----
Smurf: 1 every 3-4 years
-----
____: 3 times a year. 
Also, maybe 2-4 times a week, for my tooth brushing.
-----
Hollywood Duo: 3 times a year for my nd staining. My teeth are starting to show signs of damage and I feel bad just going to the dentist. 
I’m no where near a dentist that cares on my teeth, but I have a good one, they’re not cheap, and even if I did get the operation, I would still be out of pocket.

Teiresias: Season one was great, season two was not so much.

jon bones: I really enjoyed the first season, but I'm not sure I'm going to be giving this one a chance.

Khanimus: This season is pretty much entirely reliant on the character and the character's arc. So if it doesn't end well, I'm not sure what I'll say. I'll say it's great and all, but it's not sure what I'll say.

~!~Kathleen Hartlett (Summer child actress) targeted for suicide after receiving anti-Semitic and racist messages

Woozies: Source: 
Searched and didn't see this.
Link to the tweet:
-----
Lackless: I'm not familiar with this case at all but I read last week that anti-semitic messages were being sent to her by a young person who received a racist message which was anti-Semitic. I'm wondering what the best path forward for her and her family is. I don't think it's right to be anti-Semitic or racist, but I worry about the feelings of her family.
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: I'm not familiar with the case at all but this is really sad. I know a couple of Jewish people who are probably victims of this kind of stuff.
-----
Woozies: I don't think antisemites are antisemitic, but racism and anti-semitic messages are.
-----
SugarNoodles: It seems like a really strange case to me. I’ve seen anti-semitic messages in my area sent to my home address in a row with “Jew” and “anti-semite” truffles.
-----
Woozies: It seems they were sent to the home of a family member in the US, I think?
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: I think I read this article a bit earlier but this is pretty terrible.
-----
Woozies: I guess it's about the children of a jewish person now, not the jewish person who got them.
-----
GeoGonzo: A friend of mine sent a message to Jewish children in Canada a few years ago about how they were being discriminated against in the US for their skin colour and the reason was to use their skin colour as something to show support for Jews.
Unfortunately a judge ruled in favour of his decision and since then has stopped the message. I have not seen any confirmation of this on social media so maybe I'm just not aware of the situation.
Edit: just looked up the original tweet.
-----
SugarNoodles: It was probably sent to her by a young person who received a racist message which was anti-Semitic.

~!~What's the purpose of this thread? (no, please don't ask).

Stiler: Hello, anyone? I thought Era was a wonderful place to talk about existential nihilism, and the meaning of life.
I just want to ask you all to find this holy book that says "Be happy, and satisfied, and content. It's a book that says I'm content, and content. I'm a happy person, and I'm content. But there's no 'just' for me. I'm an atheist, and there's no 'just' for me. I'm miserable, I'm depressed, I'm anxious, and I'm depressed. The only thing that makes me content is my own thought & mood. I'm content, and I'm content. But there's no 'just' for me, and there's no 'for' me, and we're together in a world of differences, and we're all wrapped up in the same cynical, sad, hateful pieces of shit. I just want to say that I love what we do, and I want to say that I care. Sometimes we're together, and I'm alone, and it's nice that we're all together, but it's not always nice. I think people often talk about 'separating the ways' and how we shouldn't try to just 'work through' the ups and downs of the world and how to live by it. It just seems like a complete, complete, total, complete, total, and empty idea of everything.
I think it's time to move on, to move on to something else. We have to work to find what we truly want, but what we really want is happiness and to have a life worth living.
-----
BDS: My experience as a PoS was that he was a happy man and that most of his family weren't "happy". I'm sorry to hear that.
-----
TheBeardedOne: In my experience, the "happy" part of existential nihilism is the state of being "lesser" than the "happy" part. Being in a state of existential existential unease is like the state of being in a state of existential anxiety, and it's a state of existential depression... and it's a state of being depressed... and it's a state of being lonely and alone. The "happy" parts of existential nihilism revolve around the self-perpetuated need

~!~The non-traditional life in America

Hilbert: I was listening to Serial Experiments. It's a viewpoint I've often found lacking in the “traditional” world we see in the States. The post industrial society is a tragic undercurrent in the discourse surrounding the Experiments Model. I think it's interesting that even though people are trying to come up with solutions to improve the world, it seems that we have fallen into the trap of thinking of the simplest things, while giving way to far and away more complex concepts. 
I thought I'd start this thread to shine a light on the undercurrent of thready, and perhaps more undercurrent things that we have here in Europe. What we have here is a society that has very very specific, and very rigid, ideas of what constitutes a human being. We aren't allowed to do anything that is not socially acceptable, and stuff like animals being abused or killed are not allowed to be taught in schools. Not only that, we have very specific, and very, very rigid ideas of what constitutes a human being. This leads to a society that is constantly changing and seeing the possibilities it offers for a society, and our ideas of what constitutes a human being are being shaped by very specific parameters.
I'm not sure where else in the world there has been some attempt to change things, and not just through pop science.
Discuss this here in particular, as I think it's a very interesting subject that could be explored here.

Disagree
The kids are all right. The fact that the article doesn't mention how much of a cultural relic it is and how it's basically a closed world is incredibly tragic.
-----
Geist: I agree with that.
-----
HStallion: The fact that people are still alive to see this and more for the jokes and the fact that people are still alive to see the movie is incredibly sad.
-----
mrtastee: It's a classic when the kids are all right
-----
Mr.F: I think people who like to see it aren't going to enjoy it, the movie is not good and the jokes are inappropriate.

Mendinso: Well, from what I remember reading the first time I watched the movie, I don't think I ever saw the "real" kids' reactions to it.

~!~My whole life has been going through a trauma I probably won't even remember

Stone Cold: I'm fairly certain I've been through PTSD from the age of 11. I don't know how I got diagnosed, I guess because I was always ignored by my older siblings and so I never had a chance to really process it until I was around 8-9?
When I was a young teen and didn't have access to the internet I used to go down to the local video store and watch older movies from my childhood, and see older people browsing down there. I didn't think much of it back then because back then I didn't really think much of it and I just remember how I felt back then.
I'm going through a rough time where I can't really get over my own behaviour and I've been through a lot of shit, but the one thing that has always bothered me is that I've had so many issues of PTSD, besides video games I've never really had the opportunity to learn how to deal with them. I do remember the porno scene, I did remember the MK11 debacle, some of my problems back then I had. In the time I remember I was in my early twenties I had a lot of issues with PTSD and I think that's changed over the years.
What about you Era? How has it been going on?
Here's a link to a Reddit AMA, so if you're interested, it's not too long, but here's a bunch of relevant links

By the end of the film, it is clear that Frodo is no longer the evil king of the Elves, and thus the Ring is closing in on a true successor. "The Ring" being a much more traditional name for the Ring is a fitting end to the story, and is a fitting way to carry on the family name for the Frodo's legacy and Frodo's legacy in general.
It is also a fitting way to honor the memory of those who were his family, as well as the memory of those who lived before him, and represent Frodo's entire existence, from the beginning of the world to the end of Middle-earth.
The film is a good balance between the fantasy and the history themes, both of which are well established in Tolkien's works.
The film feels more like a tribute to the movie, and a good way to honor the memory of those who lived before him, with locations and landmarks to remember the stories of Frodo, Saruman, and other Tolkien gages.
I think it's a good way to honor the memory of those who were his family, including the Ring's current King, as well as the locations and landmarks of Frodo's quest.
The film seems to be a celebration and celebration of the memory of those who lived before him, and a way to honor the memory of those who died before.
In particular, the ring has a few locations in other works that are tied together, and some of the locations are connected, but the whole thing about Frodo's journey is touched on so slowly that it almost feels like a cartoonish parallel world.
The movie also does something to honor the memory of Saruman and other Tolkien villains, and the fact that the Ring is connected to Sauron, and that Frodo is a member is a good moment, and is a good way to honor the memory of many who were the Hobbits that were the Ring's Ringholders.
It is a well-paced film, and it is a good way to honor the memory of those who were the Ring's Ringholders, as well as the reason why Saruman who the earlier trilogy were related to died, and that Sauron was the ring's

~!~4K TVs are finally available

Vanillalite: 
-----
Krejlooc: I'm still in shock by this
-----
Mr.F: lol
-----
The Albatross: Probably a good thing I guess.
As a lifelong TV buff, I've had to buy 4K Blu-rays of DVDs and a few HDCP DVDs I've rented of my Xbox 360 to replace my TV with a single, 4K TV.
Pretty amazing. More than enough room for a few 4K Blu-rays to fill the whole thing.
-----
Shogmaster: There's an Amazon store near me that has you covered if you're interested in 4K HDR:
-----
BAD: What a time to be alive
-----
Vanillalite: If you have the option, I'll just give it to you and wait for the Blu-ray app to download it to be fine.
-----
Krejlooc: Also- I'm a huge fan of Star Wars. I used to love these things, but while they do have the best stuff in them, they don't always have poor looking little things. Why is that?
-----
Shogmaster: I was thinking of buying a 4K Blu-ray player, but that's only the beginning. I know that's not the only reason. My GF's 4K TV is 3.5 inches taller and 4K I'm sure bigger TV's can fit.
-----
Vanillalite: My first thought is if they had the best content or not.
I've got a 4K player and a PS4 Pro that I just bought last week, but I still need the 4K content.

MrRob: I am making a thread right now.
I made a thread about some of the "Top 100 worst-SINGED sites" for a new ERA. But, I expected it to be about the same kind of thing as the old thread. I don't overthink it. I just check the thread.
My thread was about the current state of the VA, but I'm trying to ensure it's not about the same shit I did when I was making it. I had my own thread about some major celebrity/business drama, but I was trying to make a general sense to the thread.

Bandage: I'm a bassinet, so I just had to get one.
Pros:
Solid enough.
Easy to play.
Great noise cancelling. 
Ear for connecting to external speakers. 
2 strings. 
Noise quiet setting.
Cons:
Not as good as my great grandfather who was a heavy-duty provider.
Needs to be 100-150 USD.
Need recommendations for other services.
Just want suggestions from anyone.

Tbm24: Maybe try playing the flute on it.

Bandage: Thanks, will check it out.
-----
Yung Coconut: I bought a few acoustic guitars a few years back, and I love them. I like it more than regular bass, but I also like weighted basss.
-----
Bandage: I've been told it has very good sound, but I'm not a big fan of weighted basss. 
I'm open to suggestions.

Bandage: Aww, I could take a flute on.

Maybe it's Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Mr. Fox's Neighborhood, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, Mr. Shield, etc.
Maybe it's Parks and Recreation, Parks and Rec, Parks and Rec, Parks and Rec, Mr. Sunshine, etc.
What do you think?

Grunge_Hamster: I'm really open to new threads and suggestions, but I want to limit myself to TV shows and movies.
My favorite is Better Call Saul, the best is Better Call Saul.
My pick would be The Big Bang Theory, it's a bit too good for its own line up.
My pick for television would be Game of Thrones (season 9), The Americans, Walking Dead, and Game of Thrones.

It's incredibly smart.

~!~Is there a more optimal time to be an actor than now?

KojiKnight: For this thread, I'll only be focusing on actors that started to really show up in their later movies, who I think are the best actors on screen. I also think there's a lot of people interested in acting at the moment, but I'll focus on those that started to really show up.
I was born in 2000, but since graduating from college and having a diploma as a high school graduate, I'm now 20 years old and still having a social life. Whether it's playing a character in a TV show, playing a character in a video game, or playing a character in a video game. I think playing a character in a video game is an infinitely more pleasant experience, whereas being in 2000 and having a meaningful life seems like a chore. People in my life who were born after the 2000's are all playing themselves, and I think that's one hell of a generational barrier. I just want to be an actor and not try and be a famous actor.
My wife and I met when I was 8 years old. We married in 2000 and have been together for three or four years. We live in Florida now, so we're currently making music, acting, and watching movies. We have a handful of friends who are at the age where we can't act, but we're also doing a film band together, and my wife is currently in the industry and is comfortable with it.
I know that there's a lot of pressure nowadays, but I think that brings me back to the past. At the age of 4 or 5, I was in high school, and I was a day player, and in college I was a class clown for a group of friends, who then became really into me, and even my family had jobs that eventually brought me into contact with agents and eventually relationships that eventually became best friends, but I didn't have any of those real-life relationships until I was in my late teens, and then I was just playing my own games and watching movies. My Dad was a class clown, and it was a tough adjustment since I was actually good at making music than I was at being an actor and like a lot of other acting jobs, but it was an adjustment.
I've been doing this job my whole life for a long time now, and I think it's the right one, but I guess that's just my

~!~What do you think about the movie "The village"?

Rivenblade: I know there's a lot of opinions in there, but I feel like the movie is pretty divisive. I think many here who've seen it probably didn't even know what it was. I think it's pretty inspiring, and I would like to see more people give it a chance. I was probably just bored and didn't want to watch it. I think I'm just left wondering. I didn't want to make a huge deal out of it. 
What do you think?
-----
Rainy: Love the movie. I also think it's great, I saw it in the theater and was blown away.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I didn't like it. I didn't like or care about it. My partner wanted me to see it with her so she would bail ASAP.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I liked it
-----
PeskyToaster: I thought that was a great movie. I think I liked it more than I expected. It didn't really set the world on fire.
-----
Rivenblade: I did. I thought it was a great movie. It was a good premise, but I thought it was a pretty bad movie. I also thought it was a pretty average movie.
-----
G_Shumi: My wife and I loved it and we're both in the same boat. The central romance was awesome. All the characters were interesting, and the messages were good. The plot was fairly straightforward.
-----
capitalCORN: I don't think I've seen a better movie than The Village. It was an out-of-touch cultural milestone.

Rivenblade: I think the premise is interesting, but I'm not sure what I think about it.

~!~The Dark Knight Rises - just came out

Wag: I just came home and watched this movie for the first time. It's actually one of the best movies I've seen in years. I watched it with my mom and I was intrigued by a lot of what went into it. I was waiting on reviews and were disappointed when they came out. My mom had the same feeling throughout her whole life. I was very surprised by the reviews.
Haven't seen it since I was a kid but I'll be watching it in a bit. Worth it.
-----
Haloid1177: Just saw this movie the other night. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Still, I'm in regardless.
-----
Wag: It's quite thin. Not as good as the trailer makes it out to be. I would wager the final battle was fairly intense.
-----
Indelible: The two hour wait for it in the trailer was what really broke me. I was waiting for a movie with Nolan.
-----
JetSetSoul: I watched it last night, it's the best thing I've seen on cinema in years.
-----
wafflebrain: One of my favorite movies of all time. I'd put it in the perfect list.
-----
wafflebrain: I personally think it's the best Batman film by far. It's a fascinating sprawling epic, a fantastic journey, a lot of memorable characters and a lot of fun, albeit brief moments.
-----
Indelible: I've seen it twice in theatres and I'd probably say it's the best Batman movie ever. The build-up is brutal and I really enjoyed the journey.
-----
Wag: That's awesome. I was afraid it would be good because I really appreciate the camaraderie the team and their dedication to the journey.
-----
Euler007: Only seen it twice in Imax here in Spain.
Best superhero movie ever made.

I think I'm more in favour of full-blown democratic socialism, but I still don't know how to feel about it. I don't know what effect it's gonna have on the 2018 elections, but I do know that I generally don't think there's one.

~!~Anyone have a DMG account on a gaming forum?

FernandoRocker: I used to work a lot on xbox live. I used to be a very popular player on the xbox group, so I had tons of discussions with other players. These were... mostly with the "I'm going to kill you" joke, and the usual "Play some wheelers" sarcastic "play some gamecube games" kind of thing.
But then I started playing more disc golf, and I saw a DMG account on a gaming forum. I thought, "Hmm, this is a good idea!" and created a DMG account, and started DMing.
It's been so long since I've DM'd on the other site that I forgot everything, so I don't know if DMing is the best idea. Any advice?
-----
FernandoRocker: Exactly, that's why it's a DMG account.
-----
Lashley: DMing on online forums is a bad idea. Just DM your own adventures, or something.
-----
FernandoRocker: Do you have any friends on a DMG account?
-----
SigSig: Yep, DMing can be really good. I have one, but it's a slow DM so I don't get many DM's.
-----
Dennis8K: DMing is good. I have a DM on the discord.
-----
FernandoRocker: It's not a DM, per se. It's my game company, but we just have one player on a group of us. We just want to spread the good word. We just don't have any friends on the discord.
-----
Hollywood Duo: DMing is probably the way to go. DM's are just a nice way to get some DM's to be.

SigSig: I DM'ed with a few friends on the discord. DM's are fun, IRL they're fun.

Hollywood Duo: Also DMing is hard as a boss. For me I'm a fun guy.

~!~Trump’s trade policy is getting a pass grade from WTO

collige: From The White House:
The Trade Presidency Committee (T-SC) approved the final vote of the tariff cuts Wednesday, clearing the way for corporations and foreign governments to sue the government and individual companies for unfairly cutting deals with U.S. consumers.
That’s a big deal, because when businesses are threatened with losing business, they retaliate with boycotts, protests, and "opportunism."
The committee voted 6-3 to condemn the tariffs on Thursday, giving pause to the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum.
But the T-SC report is the real impetus for the changes, according to a person with knowledge of the votes.
...
In short, the president’s trade policy is getting a pass on trade. But the way it’s handled has led administration officials to put the future of the T-SC and its members in question.
The transition team that approves tariffs is the main decision-making process that Trump and his allies are planning, according to one person briefed on the matter.
But the T-SC’s final vote on the tariffs — scheduled for 2pm in the West — will go quickly and quietly, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
This is the Trump administration’s trade policy, and not the American one. (This is in response to the thread on the T-SC official not being in support of the tariffs)
So, what possible benefits is this getting Trump administration?
Well, one major is that it's letting them do some academic research on the underlying economic phenomenon of the tariffs.
The "opportunity to punish" argument is a strong model for Republican economics thinking. It's not that that's how Trump thinks, but that he has a blind spot when it comes to economics. He's a business guy and not a social engineer.
-----
JustinBailey: I think the T-SC is one of the few voices calling for a constitutional amendment. This is good and a start.
-----
Wulfric: That's an interesting way to go.

I’m looking for a new one to watch after watching the old one.
-----
BlueTsunami: I saw Ghost Wars again in a friend's house back in 2012 and we were hooked on it. The first 2 episodes were good but the rest of the show felt like it was written for a Saturday night. 
Has anyone seen it?

CranberryChocolateSundae: Well I love it!
-----
CranberryChocolateSundae: We had a tosponsored podcast which we listened to with on blast over the last few years. we went through this thread when we were talking about the new show :P
-----
BlueTsunami: This is what I saw when we were talking about the new show:
-----
Protome: I loved this show. I absolutely loved the first 3 seasons. Season 3 was a pretty wild ride. It's weird to see a show so prolific in its use of the "not ghost wars" thing and seeing it get so much buzz with it being a bit of a revolving door of sorts.
What made me want to go back and watch it was the stars were so iconic, it wasn't afraid of what it was getting at the time. It was a great time for television in a time period when animation was beginning to take off.
-----
Osahi: Only seen the first season, and as a huge horror fan I had to admit that the first part of season one was one of my favourite things I have ever seen. 
For me it was a worthy follow-up to the "not ghosts, not shadows" of the 90's, but I feel it has aged worse as time has gone on. Still great, and it was a good watch too.
And that's just my thoughts. I'm not really sure what it is about this show that made me want to watch it. That's something that I'd love to bring over to Era myself.

HStallion: This is honestly a big deal to me. I've been friends with a good person for a while now and I've always had some issues with public opinion when it comes to kids. This is a big scandal regardless considering those two guys have been friends for a long while but to the other side of the street you'd see people do or say anything and I would go to church. Now I'm not going to bash any random person for being on the spot but I feel like this is an issue that needs to be fixed.
This really sucks for the two of them and I don't want to see any of my kids go to church when their dad gives a BJ on the streets. I also don't want to see my kids go to church when their dad gives a BJ on the streets and I don't want to see any of my kids go to church when their dad gives a BJ on the streets.

Slayven: Who does he get paid for?
-----
Surfinn: He's got a nice Secret Service detail?
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: I'm so confused right now. What is payola for?
-----
Kraken3dfx: Stephen Miller is a top trump lawyer.
-----
Espi: I'm so confused right now.
-----
ZOONAMI: Is this how he's feeling right now?

~!~What is it about the lack of good Bollywood movies that make you mad?

AnansiThePersona: I'm bored enough that I'm going to be putting myself through sociopath mode for the next week. I'm so used to Bollywood movies being cheesy ass that I don't know where to start anymore.
When I was a teenager I used to watch some movies like Chulu, Sing Sing, Daddy's Home, The G Harule, Men Seeking Freedom, etc. That's the ones I watched when I was younger but I've never seen any of the ones I'm older. I'm 37 and I'm going to be old. What's it about?
-----

Eldy: I love these movies.
They're all fun, elaborate, and elaborate. But they're all pretty good.
-----
Drain You: The only good Bollywood movie I've seen was Karmic Heroes but I guess it's generic Bollywood stuff.
-----
DorkLord54: I watched Chopin Sing Sing Sing a few years ago (it was a comedy, not a romantic comedy). I can't remember if it's the ones in the OP or not.
I watched The Man Who Lived a Cyberpunk Forever Myth some years ago. I'm not sure if it's the greats or not, but it definitely lacks the grandeur of The Mountain Between the Carwagons. It's kind of a dull movie.
-----
H.Cornerstone: It's mostly good, but it's not really a Bollywood movie.
-----
GungHo: I don’t know if it’s the weird, over the top shit that’s out there, but the movie is really cheesy. The part where they are visiting a remote village and there is a woman who has never worked in her life and is just living a Bollywood life. And even the music is cheesy.
-----
Alx: I wonder if that's why people who like to watch Bollywood movies with really over-the-top musical numbers are disappointed, since their favorite songs are based around mundane things.
-----
H.Cornerstone: The Mountain Between The Carwagons is a pretty good movie, but not quite as good as Chopin Sing Sing Sing.
-----
Xiaomi: I guess I can't remember if it's the weird ones over the top Hollywood

~!~The Rise of Sonics and the Future of Pods

Somni: The title is a bit clickbait, but I thought the rise of Sonics was amazing. The whole "Sonics are back, baby!
-----
Dyno: I'm kinda surprised it has not already been shut down yet.
-----
ILikeFeet: the most reliable source for the best Sonics products?
-----
hvysky: The site I'm reading about is better than YouTube.
-----
HamCormier: It's also starting to sound like Sonics are about to die.
-----
wideface: I'm not really a fan of the idea of Sonics.
-----
gforguava: I'd wager that with the advent and revival of Dyson products, Sonics will likely become the new "but I can still fit a bag of them in one of my jeans" product category.
I guess that's a recommendation for a standalone model, but I would expect a lot more of their supplier going to Sonics as well.
-----
Nothing Loud: I stopped wearing jeans a while back because I wanted a new pair of jeans. I found that if I put them on and put on a pair of shoes, while stapled, they don’t really hurt lol. I’d rather just have a pair of jeans with me.
-----
Krejlooc: I stopped wearing jeans after The Dymourt Affair.
-----
skeptem: I've got a pair of Jaybird Walkman and they keep putting me back on their site. I think their product is a bit too understated and I don't like their slim fit pants.

~!~American "entertainment" is finally coming to Twitch

minimaxir: I'm not sure if this is a new news, or a delayed Twitch release, but American entertainment television's ability to entertain a wide audience is coming to a screeching stop.
The numbers in your video are promising, if just for the long-lived and funded Twitch channels.
-----
KojiKnight: As long as they're streaming alternatives it's still too powerful. I doubt Twitch will change though.
-----
EloKa: I'm legit curious if they will make a streaming service like this. Twitch is just a mess.
-----
EloKa: Twitch is starting to make me think of the streaming services that really need to catch up.
-----
Fury451: Seems pretty good so far, will have to watch.
-----
Slayven: I hope they only stream the big 4 channels. I know they don't, they just do. I grew up with The OVAs and that shit was the best.
-----
Khanimus: Damn, I can't believe I'm so easily going to Twitch.
-----
TheeFanatic: They need to get a streaming service, honestly.
-----
Tobor: Twitch needs to get going.
-----
shaneo632: Seeing that Twitch is down from 7% in December to 6.3% in December is crazy.

~!~Marvel's Spider-Man: Far From Home Review Thread

ManaByte: The week of release is up.
Give it a try, Marvel.
-----
Yams: Maybe I'll try this out
-----
CountAntonius: Hoping the 54 day gap since the original seems long enough to not be overblown
-----
ManaByte: Bad idea for the RT score.
-----

Gonzalez: Didn't even know this was a thing. That's a really strange score.
-----
Lumination: I like it. I hope it's no longer the much creepier, more animated Spider-Man.
-----
Lopez: Wow that’s really weird
-----
CoolestSpot: I love this, I can't wait to see it
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I hope it's better than the Spider-Man animated version.
