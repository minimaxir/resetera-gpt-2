~!~How long before I can leave the US (not the UK) and get an emergency job offer?

Nerfgun: So I'm looking to get an emergency job and I've got no experience whatsoever. The only reason I'd be okay is because I have a medical condition that makes it hard for me to work here and it's a native Canadian. I don't want to put in the hours, I just want to go home if I get offered the position. I've been full time in the past for this job for 6 years (went to university and worked in the same company for 2 years before switching to the other company, I'd like to go back to school).
Has anyone else had to go to the US and back again? How long is your stay? I'm looking for any suggestions on a place outside the US and I can stay for a reasonable amount of time, I want to be able to get an emergency job and go to the US often.
-----
nsilvias: How long will stay in the US be? 
The only job I've ever had is part time at a bank.
-----
Heath V: I'm in the US for now but I've been looking into applying for another job, I think I'll look into a company interview job first.
-----
Nerfgun: If you're in the US for a period of time (say 5-6 months), you won't be able to go back. I'd say try to find a company in your area, even if you don't have a job there.
-----
Nerfgun: Oh right. I figured it would be interesting to try to get interviews in my location. I'm going to start applying for jobs at places I have no job in.
-----
Nerfgun: Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm getting the right guy here. I feel like I'm getting the right guy here. I mean, I'm doing a full-time full-time medical program at a Canadian university, if I had to choose a career path, I'd pick that career path over one that's rather difficult for me.
-----
AxeVince: I am in the US for a year currently, and I applied for a few jobs. They are all in Canada, but I have a degree in mathematics.
I also have a university in mathematics, looking into online courses

~!~The final season of Game of Thrones is coming in February (NO SPOILERS)

Bleepey: I'm not sure if this is a new thread, but its time to post the last season of the GoT epic.
Game of Thrones was a phenomenon phenomenon and was sold several million copies. It is widely considered the best book series of all time, yet there are people who have read it and moved on. If you have not, you owe a debt to your time spent watching the show and discussing it in general. Let the show die and go back to a simpler time, and let the show continue on.
-----
Drewton: It's on Netflix and I read it and I was like:
This is a good choice for what it is I just didn't like (so this one, really!)
-----
Bleepey: It's a bit of both. Blood, Sand, and all the Sand People.
The show is a masterpiece.
-----
Zukuu: I just finished the series in December. I'm not sure what to think about it, just a good time to watch it again.
-----
Cheebo: I have watched the show for the first time in ~20 years.
George is gone and the Lannister saga is a mess. 
The show is entertaining despite the bad writing and the bad acting.
-----
Bleepey: I think the writing for the last 4 seasons is what makes this show really great.
-----
Bleepey: I dunno I saw the show get better and better during the filming of season 3. I think the last few episodes are good.
-----
AgainstTheCurrent: I never really understood why it was popular when I was younger. I think I was just told "this is what Game of Thrones is all about".
I don't think anyone outside fans of that era really cared about it.
-----
Bleepey: I did understand why some were upset at Ned being there but I dont think I could translate that into words. I think the story was meant more for Arya/The Hound/Shae)
-----
Cheebo: The show was not popular when I watched it but I think its been changed a lot since then. I remember it was only 2 seasons but by the time the GoT finale aired it was already over.

====================
~!~So... I just got a call from a friend who's going on 5 weeks of vacation a week...

rude: So I live in Illinois. He's been cutting corners of the US. I worked there for a year as a cashier and just wanted to vent..
I'm an old man with chronic depression. On top of constantly beating my head against my desk trying to make ends meet, chronic issues like depression and suicidal thoughts. He got really upset when I tried to talk to him about it, and within the hour of getting him to talk to me he told him he would have a new supervisor if he didn't cut his corner. I asked him if he could cut me out of life insurance because I was responsible for his death and he told him no. He told me he'd call again within 2 weeks and once that was resolved he was cool with it.
It's been 20 years since my last vacation there so it's all good, but every time I see him in person he seems like a douche. I'm so sick of it I wish I could help someone I could, but I can't do it. I hate being around someone who makes me feel like a failure in the work place.
-----
Cyclone: I am sorry you are going through this. My condolences.
I don't know if anyone has a similar experience like yours, but I know this is common for those that are there for a few weeks, and it does feel like you are going through the right thing. It is a terrible experience, but this is life.
-----
Mr. X: I'm sorry for what this is.
If you are still in the same place as me we can be a good friendship.
-----
Karateka: It's not good to be a good friend. I wish I had a friend like you, but you're just not good enough.
-----
Baconmonk: Please don't go to see this friend.
-----
BAD: What is your relationship like?
What do you work on?
-----
rude: I work in retail so I don't have much to contribute other than to rant. Thank you for the useful info.
-----
Akira86: bruh. what is going on?

Bakercat: What's going on?

Mammoth Jones: Look into a real therapist and be honest.

He's a tough guy.

~!~What Was When The Dark Knight Rises Went from "Gotham" to "The Dark Knight"?

Pilgrimzero: I’m sure we all have remembered the Dark Knight Rises.
Even newer movies like The Dark Knight, The Witch, and the Coven.
This movie was kind of a wild and crazy science fiction movie. The whole world was on the line.
There was a lot of crazy stuff, a lot of crazy people were crazy.
Also the Dark Knight Rises was the first superhero movie with a cast that wasn’t really any part of the same Gotham gang as Batman, and didn’t have real super powers like Wonder Woman in the back of the head.
-----
The Kree: I don't remember Batman beating the shit out of a kid.
-----
Pilgrimzero: I’m not sure, I don’t think I remember it as well. 
I think I like the Dark Knight more than any of those movies.
-----
LionPride: I remember the twist tho, the whole Psycho angle was insane
-----
Disco: It was pretty great. The first time I saw it I was legit crying. I didn't get it back then but I watched it again and it was all over the place. I also think I saw Batman killing some guys dudes on the plane. That shit was insane. Wasn’t a huge deal.
-----
LionPride: That's what makes it good is that it was good to watch
-----
DarkLordMalik: I remember the twist and shit.
-----
Broken Joystick: I remember watching it and thinking the film was great but I don't remember having any problems with it other than a few minor quibbles.
-----
Rassilon: Shit, I didn’t know this was a thing.
-----
Dali: I remember seeing this movie at some point when I was a kid and I was so confused by it.

~!~I had a very brief moment of light where I was able to feel a strong light bulb fall from my face

The Artisan: Having a few really brief moments where I felt very light I was able to feel a bulb fall from my face. I've always thought this seemed like a rare instance of a light falling from the sky, but I'm curious to know if anyone else had similar.
-----
Taki: Could it be the sunlight hitting it?

Halo 2: You’re just making a fart

~!~When is the best time to take a day off?

entremet: In the US. I've had to take time off on business trips and I've been back to the office since 10am. I've been enjoying my days off earlier this week.
However, I'm trying to gain weight. I also hate the job. I hate the coworkers. I hate the bosses.
I was just wondering when is the best time to take a day off. I would think it's around 3-4am when I wake up otherwise it's a crazy amount of time.
-----
xxracerxx: In the UK? 3-4am.
-----
Cocolina: In the US? 4am.
-----
JJDubz: In the US? 4am. 
Im mostly awake right now.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I take my wife to the pub for a few hours a week, then up to dinner when I'm off. The pub is a nice place, so I don't mind it.
-----
entremet: Is this month?
-----
xxracerxx: I get up at 2am to take my wife to the cinema. I'm also on my laptop working on finishing up a job interview and was thinking about taking a day off.
-----
Cocolina: Yes. It's pretty fucking lovely.
-----
entremet: Not working on one right now, but I wanted to try and transition to writing decently. Going to bed around 6pm.

~!~What's the best way to use a USB-C to Mini USB-A cable?

FernandoRocker: I have a cable that has USB-C port on it, but I can't use it to Mini-USB-A cable.
I recently bought a USB-C cable from Best Buy.
The cable is 4 ft, 21 In. long.
The cable is the cable that connects my PC to my linked laptop.
When I plugged in my laptop, I saw a USB-C slot.
When I put the cable in my PC, I saw a Realtek modem.
My laptop has USB-C and when I put in my laptop, I see a Realtek Ethernet adapter.
My MacBook Pro is connected to my MacBook Pro, but I can't use my MBP to a cable.
I tried to use my MBP to my mini USB-C port, but it failed.
Easily considered, what's the best way to use the USB-C connector on my MacBook Pro?
-----
FernandoRocker: Any suggestions? It's the connection between my laptop, my AirPods, and my PS4 charging via the USB-C port.
-----
Mendinso: I think it's probably easier to just use a USB cable as a cable, and then plug the computer into the port to use as a cable.
-----
Mendinso: Thanks, gonna look into that.
-----
FernandoRocker: Thanks, I'm good now.
I have a USB-C to Mini-USB adapter that I use for my MacBook Pro.
-----
Mendinso: If I plug it into my MacBook and then put the cable between my laptop and PS4 into USB-C, it'll work fine.
-----
FernandoRocker: Thanks, I think it's time to let me know about my problem.
-----
Sei: USB-C to Mini-USB adapter.

~!~The most evil game of all time

Gundam: Pardon my French, but can someone translate this game into spanish?
I just want to talk about the whole thing, not just the aesthetics, the whole thing is horrible.
More seriously, I just want to talk about this game, because I've never heard about it before. It's one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen.
There's your Guardian Tweet who made the thread, and some other people who didn't know it was there, so if you haven't checked it out, now's the time to do so.
-----
HStallion: I'm sure a lot of people know this game is a real thing.
-----
Gundam: I just want to be pleasantly surprised by it as well. It seems pretty borderline at home. I'm curious to see how the rest of it turns out.
-----
TheCthultist: It’s definitely a piece of shit, but I’ve never heard of it. Pretty sure it’s just a European game of twerking.
-----
Vulcano's Assistant: Sounds like a videogame somewhere
-----
gaugebozo: I've always had a bit of a problem with games labeled as sub-human.
-----
Euler: I haven't played it myself, but I've heard it described as a young, troubled kid who went to the video game section of a store and got all the praise for it.
-----
Gundam: I'm pretty sure I've seen this game. Is it popular?
-----
Gundam: Played it a few months ago. It is certainly action-oriented and has the creep factor of a 90s video game.
-----
Euler: Oh, nice. I'll check it out. I've heard about it, but I'm not sure the responses.

====================
~!~Just watched the most (not very) damning LOTR documentary ever made, and I'm not sure what to think or think.

Deleted member 1258: I was just watching LOTR; was not expecting much, but it was something. I think the first time I watched the film was like 10 years ago, I didn't see any of my friends even know what the fuck they were getting into, and I wasn't able to even tell that it was a book. That was a few years ago while I was still learning how to read.
I'm not surprised by this, the film is well researched and well made. But I've never really seen a Republican party ever fall down on the accusation that the Democratic Party is racist, or that the media is racist. Only recently have I seen a Republican party ever fall down on accusations of racism, or that it is racist when I've seen movies that use the word "racism" a lot.
The documentary is pretty well researched, and the claim that Mr. Rowling is a victim of systematic racism is an obvious lie. But the idea that the Democratic Party has ever actually held racist views as a party is repugnant to me.
-----
Hollywood Duo: It's a valid theory because it's not supported by the evidence.
-----
Deleted member 1258: This isn't disputed.

~!~One Year Later, The Persecution Of H3 - Documentary/Speculation

Homeworkmvp: Saw it on Imgur and thought I'd share it here, now I've seen it on YouTube and read the synopsis.
Diffrences I.E., being from Iran, being a minority, being gay, being Muslim
I.E., my friend was Iranian, my girlfriend was Muslim, my mother was Muslim, I was born in America, I was born in America, my grandmother was also Muslim, my uncle was also Muslim
It's disheartening.
Now how could I forget about the primary causes of this mess:
-Being gay
-Being gay
-Being gay
-Being Muslim
If I was born in America I would be born in America, but I'm born and I'm here to be discriminated against because of it.
I want to make a joke but I don't know how.
Some more information (maybe not so much here as here but here):

~!~Men in Black (MTV's new animated series) is the best thing on YouTube

Razgriz-Specter: After watching the first episode, I'm floored that this is real good.
The show is hilarious, smart, funny, clever, and continues to be funny.
The first season was also great.
Season 2 is a mess, the second season is great and the third season is great too.
The first season ended very abruptly, and I believe the second season is still ongoing.
I think I'm going to subscribe to this as well.
I think it's pretty amazing.
Also, the guy who plays Azula is an outstanding cast director.
-----
robotrock: I don't even know what to say
-----
black070: I love this show.
-----
metsallica: Love this show.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Yeah, it's great.
-----
Krejlooc: HBO had a pretty good sale on there for last season/season, lol.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: It's a good show that has some great actors but I don't know if it's better than other animated shows or the animated series(I'm guessing the animated series, but I can't remember)
-----
Krejlooc: I really like this show, it's just weird.
-----
KojiKnight: I'm a big Azula fan (and it's about the same age as me), but I know she's a little older. Like, she's probably around her teens. She's in the 3rd season, but her family is... who knows?

~!~Anti-sexual harassment movement targeting men (WaPo)

Kirblar: This is the latest in a long line of "movement" moves that have been targeting women, but the actual target of it is men, and the real target is men themselves.
-----
Slayven: A movement that will never win?
-----
Lord Brady: If anything, it's come under scrutiny for the very reason it hasn't become as much of a talking point amongst progressives.
-----
Kirblar: No, actually it's been under scrutiny for years. It's only now that the social media campaign and hashtag #metoo are coming out.
-----
Kirblar: The movement, like any movement, has grown in scope and scope and momentum over the last few months and the movement is gaining traction. It's not a winning movement on a technicality, but it has gained traction and momentum and has the potential to become a great one if it gets the attention it deserves.
-----
kittens: WE KNEW WE'RE VENIL
-----
Slayven: I am not sure I understand the point of this article,
Women are asking for it, they want it, they want it, they want it.
-----
lazygecko: Probably not the general population, but the movement is growing at a very rapid pace that I think is linked to media coverage of the subject.
-----
Kirblar: The actual target is a "movement" that has the potential to be a great one, but the actual target of it is a movement that has the potential to be a great one - though the actual target of the movement is men, who skew more conservative than the movement's subject, because the movement is massively, very conservative and not as strongly funded as the PewDiePie controversy.

~!~Help me choose the right camera for my PCs

Dragonzdogma: Hello PC Era! 
I'm thinking of getting a proper setup. 
I haven't been using my Sony rechargeable camera for a while now, but the battery on this thing is terrible. 
I'm thinking of getting a Sony rechargeable Sony C 55 for each lens. 
I've come up with this:
It has 2 settings under the options menu, F and L
If I click on F, the option called Battery % "of each lens" is displayed.
If I click on L, the system battery percentage is also shown.
If I click on F, the system battery percentage is also shown.
And I also want to make sure F constantly activates. So I'd like to keep these two settings as long as possible.
I really, really like the Sony C 55. 
What's the best camera to use for this setup? 
Also, suggestions, shoutouts, thank you!
-----
Dragonzdogma: Nice to know!
-----
xxracerxx: Is it just for PC users or do you need a system for Mac?
-----
Dragonzdogma: I'm thinking for PC Era users just want to know how to use it.
-----
xxracerxx: Hey thank you all. 
I'm hoping to have a Camera OT as well so I'm open to everyone suggestions/suggestions. Any help would be great.

~!~Netflix is reportedly considering creating its own streaming service

GG-Duo: I know the most obvious example of this is Amazon Prime, but I'm not surprised at all by this.
-----
Punished Goku: Why would anyone want to watch a random random random Netflix movie?
-----
metsallica: It's a good thing that Netflix is literally that elusive startup that can afford to let the kids watch it, but they're going to need to build a library to stream it, right?
-----
Ithil: They're taking the basic Netflix experience and turning it into a streaming service by 2020.
-----
TheAbsolution: Nah. The basic shit doesn't make up for the quality of the service.
-----
Slayven: The basic experience is already better than Netflix stealing ideas, and they are making a service with it
-----
BAD: So that’s why people are going to watch the basic. It’s not a much better streaming experience than the standard Netflix experience, but if it was just the basic they provided with it would be a crapshoot.
-----
Ferrs: Honestly I don't see how you could have a library that's not just tailored to it's library type of life. I mean, streaming to a computer is probably what they could be streaming to anyway, but I don't see why they would change that.
-----
Beartruck: I feel like Netflix is just going to be a standard streaming experience for a while.
-----
Kthulhu: Why would they afford to do this? How is a basic cable/sat/Netflix subscription worth it?

Tamanon: They're ignoring the original's roots.
-----
Gundam: Gonna be a reboot for sure.
-----
Signal: In.
-----
Xe4: I'm really happy to see a sequel to the original. I was too used to the previous movies being trash to see this one coming to fruition.
Also, I saw this in the theater. It was a cool movie.

====================
~!~How do you deal with being blindsided when listening to the same song over and over again?

Krejlooc: I've done this a few times, and it's usually just me being on the same car or in the same town for a few minutes, and it usually just slows down and doesn't come into full-nerve. It's a very common issue for me, and I know it has to do with the synchronicity of my voice.
It's also something I've been having a problem with, because I can't hear pretty much anything in general anyway. I've checked my own stuff, and it doesn't really seem to happen.
Does anyone else deal with this?
-----
norm9: When listening to the same song over and over again, how do you deal with it if you don't know how to do it?
-----
Krejlooc: I'm deaf, so I just keep repeating it over and over and over again. It's pretty annoying.
-----
Yoshichan: I can’t hear what you're saying here
-----
Krejlooc: I know the song, but since I can't hear what you're saying, I'm going to use it instead.
-----
TAJ: I can only hear what your asking for, but I have no idea how to do it at home.
-----
norm9: Mine has been solved. I'm deaf as well, but I don't really care about it.
-----
Krejlooc: ...
-----
Spenny: This is very difficult.
-----
dots: This sounds more like a series of episodes than me clearly understanding what you’re saying.

====================
~!~What is the most unexpected/out of business/unwanted thing a customer said/done?

rude: Just curious whether other people are shocked/wanted.
I mean a friend of mine said he can't get anything done because the service was delayed while the person he is talking to was on call. I think he's right that we should wait until the response from the service person or the person he's talking to is received.
-----
Fantastapotamus: Not a surprise that a lot of customers are on call
-----
Mendinso: This.
-----
Fantastapotamus: That's a pretty big thing that can be ignored
-----
Mendinso: Well, I understand that. That's not a surprise I just wondered what the general rule is.
-----
Dalek: I’ve never had a problem with this.
-----
Driggonny: Nothing shocking about it really, but she sounds like a really nice lady.
-----
Pickman: A bunch of customers I work with put me to sleep last night because they were talking to a new girlfriend. One of them called in sick and I thought it was the over in Sareth (not the name of the doctor). I texted my boss today to ask what was going on. He called me up and asked where I live (I'm in the city). I told him it was the Sareth and he told me: "Go to Derry".
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Tell me.
-----
PeakPointMatrix: I mean, this is just one of those kinda things. I think it’s sus general rules of being human that people do this. Sure there are exceptions, but it wouldn’t be surprising to be the person talking to came to work to get shit done.

====================
~!~In her own words: As a black woman, I feel empty despite being overtaken by racism.

AuthenticM: From the Guardian:
I don't know if the replies are as black and white as the title suggests, but I feel like I'm continually being denied the opportunity to really learn about myself and the struggles I've been having.
I feel like I'm not having enough time, I feel that I am continually being treated as if by some invisible force is at the end of the journey I just need to grow up.
And it's this cycle that I'm having trouble acknowledging.
When I was a child, I had the privilege of a white father, and I was the only black child. When I was a young adult, the white father was a white master. I had the privilege of a white father, and I was the only black adult in our house. I had to take it for granted, because no one else would have.
I've never been the one to experience this. I've lived in a society that insists that we are all equal, and for the sake of that sort of unity and unity, we must separate from ourselves. We have to. We have to move away from the things that were alien to us, and the feelings of being on the other person made it impossible for us to do so.
White people, especially those who are white, have been conditioned and enabled to feel as though their inferiority complex is our true self. They have been conditioned to think that being good and equal is contingent on our being white. This has given me a new awareness that I don't belong to that group.
I don't know why I feel empty, because I've been conditioned to feel like I'm the only black adult in our house. But I feel like I'm not in control of my own existence.
I don't know why I feel like I'm not part of the black community, because I'm not trying to become white. I'm trying to become white.
I just don't know what to say. What's left for me?
-----
Gundam: You have to accept that it's the case, and that you have to try harder to be black.
Just don't try to get caught in the alt-right wave.
-----
Volimar: I'm sure that you will understand by then.
-----
Humidex: I don't
====================
~!~What would you do with the remaining 15,000 books left in the UK?

BarryAllen: I think I am being generous with the remaining books I still have lying around the attic of my house. I would like to keep them and have them be collected into a single product. 
What would you do with the remaining books left in the UK?
-----
PJV3: I would pick up the books about The Alchemist and Lucifer, or make them a product that isn't available in Ireland, so I could buy them cheaper.
-----
Tence: I could also use the books about Cretaceous books.
-----
hobblygobbly: The Alchemist, The Gunslinger
The Gunslinger
Alcatraz
The Gunslinger
The other ones would be collected together and I would have a round number of them. Probably around 15k.
-----
BanGy: I’d pick Lucifer as a product for the rest.
-----
DriftingSpirit: I would pick up the Thomas Pynchon book series from the library.
-----
hobblygobbly: The Stewart book trilogy would be collected together and I would then buy them all.
Also I would pick up The Standman for the Kindle.
-----
Chopchop: I'd pick up the books about Cretaceous Books. I'd read them all the way through, but I'd probably be short of money by the time I got to the arc.
-----
BarryAllen: I think I would definitely read The Alchemist, the Gunslinger and The Standman.
-----
sir_crocodile: The Standman and June Diane Raphael: The Series

====================
~!~The amount of dead animals found in Africa during 2017 is nuts

fireflame: I often read stories about the animals being found in Africa, but I often read people saying that animals that were not endangered, were not endangered, or that were not endangered would be found. I always saw the argument that if you kill them, they will be found later on. It might not be a big deal if you don't kill them, but it makes me sad. It is sad, but it makes sense.
I don't know if you are familiar with the situation, but in many places, animals are found dead, with the exception of the endangered species. That is not what happens at all.
-----
IggyChooChoo: And no, it’s not surprising. We get a lot of cases of animals being found dead, or at the minimum extinct, in Africa. But that’s part of the story, and not the cause.
-----
Chopchop: That's the story I'm trying to tell. I don't think there's any evidence that animals are alive and dead.
-----
fireflame: I have read some of the accounts of cases, and no one is saying there are no animals that are alive and dead.
-----
Wackamole: I'm not sure what you mean but this is in the UK and we have no idea what is going on.
-----
fireflame: I mean we know that some animals are going extinct, but we know there are a lot of cases where we don't know what is happening.
-----
NekoFever: I don't think there are any animals that are alive and dead, but we know there are a lot of cases where we don't know what is happening.
-----
Dirt McGirt: And it's not like poison is a possibility.
-----
fireflame: If you read the article, it does say there are found dead animals but it doesn't say if there are found dead animals and if there are already found dead animals.
-----
Firebricks: I wonder if there were dead mouse or wolf-like animals in Africa? There's no real evidence of animals that are already extinct in Africa.

~!~What is the best way to watch YouTube Originals on PC?

Mr.Deadshot: I've been on a binge watching a lot of YouTube recently and I have been pretty bored with the way the whole service is shitting itself. There are certainly times where I'm in a situation where I simply want to unfriend someone and watch whatever, but hey, I'm not bored with that at all.
I know there's a couple suggestions here, but just a heads up it seems to me that I need to do some research first and I'm not sure if there's a way to watch a single YouTube video and tell me which is the best, most optimal way to do so? 
Thanks.
-----
xxracerxx: Just start with “Watching a video on PC”.
-----
Dr. Benton Quest: If you can’t tell what is best then just start with watching videos that have them muted.
One of the best suggestions I've heard was the recommendation of “Watching a video on PC”, which was a nice way to start out with a shorter amount of time to just watch the video once you start up.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: It's very possible to just start from the beginning of the video and switch over the channels to watch the channels that arent already on that channel, but I would recommend that for this kind of step it isn’t going to work very well.
-----
xxracerxx: This is something I was suggested, you can just start from the beginning. I think that is a good way to start with YouTube Originals on PC (and I am using a Chrome re-purposing browser).
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I'm using a combination of the video and Hulu app on my smart TV. So I am just using this to watch whatever I want. It's a pain because it takes a while to get going, but I am able to just watch whatever I want for a few minutes.
-----
Gustaf: youtube prem is the best
youtube prem is also the best
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I don't know about this but I was thinking of using YouTube Gold on my PS4 to watch videos in reverse chronological order. I decided to pick videos from the first few seasons of Vikings because I had heard the show was good.
-----
Gustaf:

~!~Facebook, a company, a company

Infinity Times Two: Facebook is becoming a big deal at the moment.
Investors are rising up to it as a legacy network, a small conglomerate of companies.
-----
Lidl: That's a really cool idea. I wonder if the big investors have an even bigger stake in it, or if that only comes about from Facebook being successful.
-----

hydrophilic attack: if they succeed at it, what would they cause the wider community to grow for?
-----
Randomly Generated: I fully support everything Facebook.
-----
How About No: I'm on board
-----
Funyarinpa: Could it possibly be a future big company that can become as successful as Wikipedia and Spotify?
-----
red731: Thank you for the heads up.
-----
Nassudan: Facebook is such a cool company. I hope they do well.
-----
Koo: So what's the purpose of all this?
-----

====================
~!~Who is your favorite working title designer?

shaneo632: It's a tough call - the vast majority of people (at least most people) really like the title designer - but I like the title actor. I'm not too big on the title, but it's got a sense of humor that can go really dark and dark. The question mark in the lowercase "u" is a bit too easy to spell (I think it's a capitalisation), so it's a nice textured design that's easy to read.
I guess the good news is that I'm the only designer in the world who can converse with the character.
The firmament is also a good design, the kind that comes with a lot of designer jobs, so I think it's a great design.
-----
Birdseye: Superb design
-----
Dicer: Biggest one behind Monster from Monster.
-----
Aurongel: Here's a photo of the first working title I've found for Eiichirari.
-----
Raptomex: I've always really liked the first title. I think it was German for "Exile", so I think the name is appropriate.
-----
Torpedo Vegas: The original Doctor Who.
-----
Koo: I prefer the title "The Archivist" to the title "Archivist of a foreign planet", because I like the Archivist.
-----
Platy: I like the idea that the title is better for than just the archivists and not the main character.
And I also think it is a good time to bring the tv show with the tv showrunner as well
-----
johan: I like the title designer
-----
Aurongel: The original Doctor Who.
-----

====================
~!~What's your favorite side dish?

TaterTots: Like I'll let the OP talk about how my vote is not the answer. I mean, the answer is simple, I'm just curious to see what everyone's favorite side dish is.
I'll start with a side of beef that I think is pretty good:
-----
TheCthultist: ...but you’re right.
-----
Dishwalla: a side of peas
-----
Dishwalla: a side of beef that's really good but I like to bust a side of feta cheese on it
-----
Neece: A good side of soup. Greek is my favorite soup. Italian and Indian are my favorite.
-----

BAD: Vegetables
-----
TaterTots: Omg, a side of peas?!
-----
Fantastapotamus: A good side of cheese
-----
TheCthultist: A good soup
A side of beef
A side of cheese
It’s just a fancy side... But I’m down for it
-----

====================
~!~I can't handle anything too serious.

CormoranStrike: I don't really have any friends, but I have a brother, and a younger sister is also in a relationship.
The sister is in a relationship right now and the older sister is in a relationship.
But that older sister is in a relationship and I just don't know how to deal with her.
That's why I don't really like any of the things she say I can handle.
-----
xxracerxx: You are not alone.
-----
Amory: I guess you could say it's not really that serious. 
Are you in any way attracted to her?
-----
Brock Reiher: Sounds like a good fit to me.
-----
NealMcCauley: Are you sure? A friend of hers is in a relationship right now and she's in a relationship with your brother.
-----
CormoranStrike: I don't think I am in a relationship at all.
-----
TheLostBigBoss: Sounds like a good fit to me
-----
CormoranStrike: Are you in any way attracted to her?
-----
xxracerxx: You are not really in a relationship at all.
-----
CormoranStrike: I am, that's too cautious.

~!~Film of the Year 2018

Kinthey: Best Picture? Best Director? Best Actor? Best Actress? Best performance? Best performance? Favorite voice? Best writing? Best direction? Best writing? Best cinematography? Best soundtrack? Best writing? Best performances? Best picture? 
Let's ResetERA, whoa. How was it? It was a good year for movies. What were the films you liked?
-----
Hank Hill: Best Picture.
-----
Fiction: I think I'm gonna be interested in The Departed sooner than later, but the reviews are saying it's a pretty solid movie.
-----
Kinthey: Even though critics didn't really judge it that much, the reviews seem to indicate it's a pretty solid movie
-----
Disco: Mediocre at best, but fun yes. 
Might be the one overlooked movie this year that I watch with a huge amount of interest.
-----
Metallix87: I'm not really a film buff but I just watched this the other day. It was good.
-----
Chas Hodges: Best Picture? Not really, but it's a solid list.
-----
ShutterMunster: In for both.
-----
Red Arremer: Best Picture? No, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to watch it tonight.
-----
Solo: Best Actress? No, but I will be damned if I'm not going to watch it tonight.

~!~Trump: “I love the idea of a wall” on the North 

Squarehard: Now that we are getting closer, I want to see if Trump has actually gotten to the point of tears, and if he has, from a warmongering standpoint, just lost it.
To be clear, I don't think Trump has or want to start a war with Mexico, but I think he understands that Mexico is playing two roles, trying to get relief from the pain, and that it's up to the UN to help the US with its own solutions.
-----
BDS: He hasn't even opened his mouth in 24 hours.
-----
Brock Reiher: He's probably not even going to try that on the military parade
-----
Kurdel: So is this his rambling talking point or did Mexico just not like the other attractive country?
-----
Cochese: This is going to be a good year for him in just a few weeks.
-----
Dishwalla: I mean he's got the ammo, as usual.
-----
HStallion: He's been more forthcoming with his answers on Twitter than he has at any point in the past 24 hours. He doesn't need to start a war with Mexico either.
-----
Mahonay: So he is saying things to elicit sympathy from Mexico?
-----
KHarvey16: “I love the idea of a wall,” Trump says. “I love the idea of a wall.”
-----
Squarehard: So part of the war with Mexico is Mexico paying him off and not letting him not pay it off?
He's clearly got that bullseye in his eye, and no one's giving a shit about him.

~!~Full Trailer (Cory Monteith) of 'The Incredibles' - Coming to home video December 7

Lord Brady: From director Chuck Russell and cast:
EDIT: Please refrain from posting pictures of a cat. We have enough here.
-----
WrenchNinja: Does this world have cute little caged tigers?
-----
shnurgleton: I thought this was about Mr. Incredible
-----
Z-Beat: I get that's the Incredibles, but this is about the kids being kidnapped, tortured and killed. I'd be all for a sequel.
-----
ManaByte: I think the trailer was more of a teaser than anything, but that's kind of the point.
-----
Punished Snaku: I was hoping for a more Jack Black-ish like movie.
-----
Jiggy: The trailer was pretty bad, but I'm excited for this one
-----
Sega Dreamcast: This is the most fun I've had in entertainment.
-----
Cochese: I'm so ready.
-----
SArcher: I hope it's at least a little better than the first.

~!~Nigerian Woman Arrested For Planning Mass Killing, Citing "Women Have the right to life"

Reverse Giraffe: A 31-year-old woman was arrested Thursday for attempting to kill herself in connection to a shooting in New York City.
According to the criminal complaint, filed in New York, Ms. Kourouki was planning a mass shooting at a bowling alley run by the Islamic faith community at 7:30 a.m.
"The woman is currently employed at the bowling alley, and she is in possession of a video game, the complaint states.
"Placing a bomb on her chest caused some complications, but she was otherwise in good condition," the complaint states. "She stated that she was praying for peace and for her loved ones to be spared."
The establishment said it was a terrorist group responsible for targeting black and brown people.
"We are deeply shocked and heartbroken," New York Police Commissioner Cyrus Vance said at a news conference Thursday. "We have been working closely with this establishment and their offices and had no knowledge of this incident."
New York's police department did not immediately comment.
The event on the 31 is currently under investigation by the city's Muslim community, which has sought to distance itself from the woman's actions. Vance said the department is not allowing any other suspect to enter the area.
"It is absolutely an incident that happened," Vance said. "We have always said that there is an expectation of privacy in the case. The reason for the men who are in custody is an existing community of women and they were acting in a manner that is not in any way connected to this case."
"The female suspect is also being held in the police custody of the police," he said. "Our investigation is still continuing and we are taking this into the custody of the authorities."
Am I the bad guy?
As a Christian, I feel like this kind of thing should be shut down, immediately.
Just goes to show how, in many ways, this shit is dangerous.
-----
Dishwalla: I hope her boyfriend gets caught and punished.
-----
Dook's Revenge: No, the second it comes to our attention that she committed a crime.
-----
Powdered Egg: Is she planning on suicide?
-----
Coyote Starrk: I hope she is punished.

~!~The Guardian: How to help fight racism in America

Helio: I’m very close to lost and have thought about this thread for a while. I’m writing this article after reading an important article on police brutality and the subsequent escalation of it. In the country that white people are supposed to stand their ground—where even the police are being overthrown because it is too dangerous for them—this is the first thing I’ve thought about when I came here. How to fight racism in America?

~!~Are there any good YouTube music download filters?

Dio Over Heaven: I was just reminded of the ones above. I'm on a diet of album cuts, fast cuts, etc. And I'm curious about the different types and why they exist.
I've been using FatUgly's Shrinking for a few years, but have found they don't work as well as they seem to.
Also, anyone on here with experience with filtering out album cuts? I think I might need to invest in some plugins.
And yes, I know it's not YouTube, but still.

Dio Over Heaven: It's my favorite one.

~!~Happy Bicycle Day!!!

Aiii: I am very much on the "mild surprise" side of this, and it's a damn good day, if not the greatest!
I hope it's not as bad as a B-tier day, however.
I'll try to update the OP with more info, and if anyone has any cycling stories, share them with us :)
-----
RolandOfGilead: Yep, I was just in Vancouver on Saturday and saw all the cool cycling spots. I had no idea they had been added.
-----
linkboy: I wouldn't be shocked if they were bike paths in the suburbs of Toronto.
-----
HockeyBird: Hate to be that guy but it's good to see nationalized bicycle companies come out with stuff.
-----
Aiii: I'm sure it isn't that bad. It's good to see the government take a look at things.
-----
gcwy: I'm going to be surprised if there's a bicycle sharing system in Toronto.
-----
HockeyBird: The only bike share system I would expect is if the city is a nation of bicycle citizens.
-----
Aiii: That's what I was thinking. The city is a nation of bicycle citizens, and the city is not one of them.
-----
HockeyBird: That's not what the article is about. It's about how bike sharing systems in Toronto operate.
-----
UnpopularBlargh: Here in Vancouver, there are literally dozens of bike sharing stations. I live in 'em and it's pretty ridiculous.

~!~Reservations for a Raleigh, NC Tech. Tech. Love it!

Airegin: There has been a lot of interest in getting a Raleigh, NC Tech campus in my area. I wasn't sure if Raleigh is a good fit for what the area is currently but there have been a lot of offers ranging from $10,000 a year to $15,000 a year.
I'm leaning towards Raleigh since I know there is some interest in Raleigh and the surrounding areas. What are your pros and cons? And any recommendations?
-----
THEVOID: Raleigh is gorgeous.
-----
Airegin: I will definitely go there. It won't be a Summers city but I'd like to know more about it.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Raleigh is a little bland in places but if you’re interested in Raleigh you should check out Raleigh.
-----
THEVOID: It's a two story college town. The university is also bland.
-----
Airegin: I just happened to be in the location list and was like ok.
-----
SteveWinwood: I went to Charlotte all those years ago. It's a tiny state but so very different from most of the best states.
-----
Airegin: I'll definitely be there this fall. I want to move to NC.
-----
DrFunk: What is the best area to live?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: As far as Raleigh goes Raleigh is a tiny state but the university and the town feel like home. The University of North Carolina is huge.

~!~Which of the big 4 options to add to Infinity War: IW or Justice League?

Sky Chief: I thought this was a thread about the movie, not about the respective films themselves. 
I think I'm more interested in which of the big 4 options are available vs. which of the alternatives are better vs. which of the alternatives are less appealing. 
I guess I'm interested in which of the alternatives are available vs. which of the alternatives are less appealing. 
I guess I'm interested in both of the alternatives; I'm interested in the fact that they are more appealing than the alternatives, and I'm interested that they're available vs. which of the alternatives are more appealing than the alternatives. 
What are your thoughts?
-----
TheMango55: I think I'd rather IW because the original film is so much better. If IW had a smaller budget and had less things to distract me I might be interested.
-----
Einchy: I think I'll prefer IW.
-----
jon bones: I don't think I was ready for what's to come
-----
Baconmonk: I think I'd prefer IW.
-----
Transistor: I think I'd prefer IW, but if the resolution is big enough (properly shot CG) then I'm all for it.
-----
Scullibundo: I feel that IW is the better movie, but I think the interstitials are annoying as fuck. They're so heavy and you get nothing out of them other than that, and I think the interstitials are better.
-----
Scullibundo: I don’t think the resolution is the issue. You are essentially making a 3D film.
-----
Gustaf: I think I would prefer IW, but if the resolution is so big (properly shot CG) then I'm all for it.
-----
Mcjmetroid: I think I'll prefer IW.

~!~How do I get an email notification when I sign into my Google account?

Vire: I never signed in with my google account before, well not officially, but I manually signed into my google account. When I did, I noticed that my email was getting about 5/6 email, more because I was about to sign-in to my google account than because I was about to email anyone.
I set up a time-stamp on the back of my google account so I could keep the meter on my email so I could keep getting email notifications. However, when I did so, they said "the email was not valid".
I'm not sure what to do. Should I just set it up in the email? What do I do/say?
-----
KunaiDuke: Just make a new sign in and never look at your google account again.
-----
xxracerxx: Don’t do that.
-----
Drain You: Sign into your gmail and you're good.
-----
ElMexiMerican: I'd say get a password manager or use a password manager that has password manager, like raju.co or something like that.
-----
Kor of Memory: Sign into your gmail and you're good.

~!~Palestinians in Gaza Are Planning a New Summer Camp

Reverse Giraffe: A young Palestinian man who has been living in Gaza since the 1980s says he wants to leave his country.
“I want to leave Gaza,” Elon Musk, Elon’s partner in tech, tells me. “My family is planning a camp. I want to go there, but I really want to stay.”
The pair are just the latest in a long line of tech giants taking a stand against occupation. Facebook (B), Twitter (TWTR), Google (G), and WhatsApp (TMZ) are among them, along with others, that have banned the introduction of the group’s activists into Gaza.
If the latest development is anything to go by, it will be a new development in the region, one that is not understood anywhere. The latest development, as Musk sees it, is Israel’s recent military actions in response to the growing Palestinian insurgency in Gaza.
“We have seen a lot of heinous violations from the IDF,” he tells me. “I think it is time to close this camp. I trust the people who are here to lead the people of Gaza. It’s not a control over the people. It’s ownership over the people.”
-----
UltraMagnanimous: What a horrible comment.
-----
Dekim: They're just a new development in the region.
-----
Reverse Giraffe: It's a new development in the region.
-----
FreezePeach: Is it wrong to just think that the people of Gaza will somehow turn against the people who control the Strip?
-----
Nacho Papi: Why is that?
-----
UltraMagnanimous: Because they don't want the people who are currently living there to come to Gaza. They want to be treated like the big city they're supposed to be.
-----
Theologian: I don't think the people are against the Israeli government. Nor do I think any corporation runs away with the idea of spreading propaganda its own way.
-----
electroshockwave: I guess it's just a new development in the region.
-----
Deleted member 11262: I suspect this is a recent development in the region.

~!~How do you deal with loneliness?

Gnome: I've been in a similar situation in the past few years with my wife and I living with a roommate. Had a great time, she was very supportive, and we've both been able to move halfway to the coast and get a job.
I know that the other person has a lot of issues with it, and I'm not sure how to deal with them. I'm a sweet 30-40 year old guy, and I hate loneliness, I do it for people I know that I game or watch or something, but I don't particularly like playing games, the reason I've been able to live a long time without that is because I can just sit in the kitchen, eat, and be alone.
I don't know, I'm well past the point where I probably have a good answer. I just got married last month, so I'm starting to feel like I'm in a similar situation; I have a lot of friends, but I don't really have enough to put them to good use. I do have a few on my bucket list, but I struggle with loneliness quite a bit.
How do you deal with it?
-----
shnurgleton: Put on a show
-----
Widdle Puppy: I put on a show, it will help you.
-----
Darryl M R: Are you a gamer or a memoirer?
-----
Doomsayer: I don't really deal with it but I do have a good friend group that I've been friends with for a while. I've also been able to put on a good show through The Blair Witch Project where I explore different areas of the world through my senses.
-----
Gnome: This is correct, but I'd recommend video games. Just do a bit of research.
-----
Gnome: I'm a gamer, but I actually enjoy playing games, even if I feel bored. I do so sometimes of course, but my enjoyment of other's works is a more purely personal matter.

Bishiku: I just have a show.

CormoranStrike: I've been friends with friends for a few years now, I just can’t stress enough that I have to deal with that. I can't deal with a work place or not be able to afford a rent. I can't deal with loneliness. I

~!~What is the best way to watch a completed movie in a theater-type format?

AuthenticM: So, I've been thinking about this. I've heard how great it is, but what is the definitive way to watch a movie theater-type format?
I'm looking for something online to watch in order to finish a movie, that I can enjoy while it's on, but I'm also looking for something portable.
I've seen some movies on Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime, and I'm interested in some other suggestions, but I've never tried watching in one of those formats.
Please tell me why I'm not going to bother.

~!~The Big Lebowski 3D Movie - First Trailer

jwk94: I'll admit, this looks pretty bad and not my area, but it's not Fox's high-budget fantasy movie. The movie's first trailer looked like the climax of an hour-long film about a city's skyline.
-----
Tetra-Grammaton-Cleric: Yeah, I'm in.
-----
Gonzalez: Looks like the early 2000s version of a film.
-----
Yoshi: I loved the first film as a kid, and this looks like its gonna be a movie about skyline skyscrapers.

DeeDogg: It's getting an international release. Hoping it's good.

~!~I just watched Sicario.

TheMango55: I think I watched Sicario last night. I had watched the trailer and I was like "that's fucking great". Then the last 30 seconds of the movie shows the final boss fight, and I was like "holy shit". I thought it was going to be story complete and not really following the action or plot at all. I didn't think it would be that interesting or finish but it was. Great movie, I would have watched it again.
-----
Lady Bow: It's got a sequel with Sicario 2 if it's really good.
-----
Einchy: I watched it last night and I was like "wait, it's just another movie?" What is this?
-----
Nokterian: .
-----
hydruxo: It's going to be a weird watch but I'm glad it's back.
-----
TheMango55: Yeah, I saw that trailer and thought the movie was about the story that happened back when he was 14. I'm sure there was one or two stuff in the movie that I didn't care about, but there was something about the ending I just didn't find compelling.
-----
WrenchNinja: It's a sequel to Sicario which is the best movie of the last 3 movies.
-----
TheMango55: They're not actually following it, they're just repeating what happened in the trailer.
-----
Coyote Starrk: It's a sequel to Sicario.

~!~When was the last time you used a "what's the point of this thread" thread?

SolVanderlyn: I'm a pretty big proponent of "what's the point of this thread?" threads, because they just feel good and I'm just interested in them, and I never really see myself posting in a "joke" "joke" type environment.
But lately, I just don't see myself posting in a "joke" "joke" type environment and some of the replies I get have really harsh "objective truth" about my own posts. Like, some of the people in the OP are saying that I'm being snarky, and it's just my opinion, and I'm just trying to get across the point of a post?
If I had to choose one response I would suggest that I think the premise of this thread is pretty interesting, if a bit too unavailing for it's own good. What's the point of this thread? If there's a better place to discuss that, please do so.

~!~Composer/Director J.T. McElroy on Making A Murderer: "I absolutely loved the movie"

Messi: I’m a big McElroy fan and I noticed this last night on twitter.
He talks about “making a Murderer (“the current) is a great and great film” and how the story took “a lot of inspiration from the real stuff”.
-----
Khanimus: I'm going to watch this tonight.
-----
Cocolina: I mean, he’s not wrong.
-----
Messi: Well the movie will be a crime scene and not a thriller so clearly he’s talking about the premise and not a mystery thriller.
-----
spindashing: I feel like this has been posted before and it’s been fairly well received but I didn’t see it until after this thread was made. Love that they are continuing to make these.
-----
Messi: I’m pretty sure the premise of the movie is that there is a death happening and the killers are able to communicate with the victim.
-----
Messi: I’ll admit, I was excited to see the ending to this but then the film ended and I just can’t make it through this.
-----
Khanimus: I might have to give this a bump, I'm not really that into the “crack” of the story but the ending makes the ending seem pretty clear.
-----
excelsiorlef: I enjoyed the film but I dunno if anyone can exactly soak this in more. The fact that the murderer is able to communicate with the victim and they're able to communicate pain makes it pretty clear but I dunno it's not the most clear I've seen

Volimar: I like that they're not going for a thriller. It's definitely not a sensationalist twist but the film will certainly draw a line in the sand.

However, I'm not sure how bad it is for your country. I understand why it's bad. I just don't know how bad it is.
If you could pass a law right now, what would it be and why?
I know we don't have much options.
-----
chandoog: It's just a little over a year until we can have the final result of the TPP. But we'll probably never have it.
I'm also not too hopeful; I just find it insulting that other countries are not putting effort into the final result.
-----
Shugga: Lol at the china stupidity
-----
Cochese: I'm sure Canada will bring it up in its own internal politics, but I doubt they'll bring it up as an international lawbreaker.

Dan Thunder: It's really good, I'm glad it's getting passed. It's a pretty good deal for all parties and for all parties equally.
But you know...

Mr. X: It's a little over a year till the final result.
-----
Beartruck: It was a little over 1.5 years before we could have the final result. I'm glad it exists now.

~!~Sexual violence in the entertainment industry

CranberryMuffin: I've seen a lot of sexual violence in the entertainment industry since I was a kid, but I'm looking to broaden my interests by discussing a range of topics. I've heard a lot of horror stories about sexual violence in the entertainment industry, and I'm interested in hearing other's opinions.
Here are some examples of the entertainment industry's mishandling of sexual violence and sexual violence in a variety of topics.
Horror movies
Horror media
Movies
TV
Manga
Books
Games
Video games
Comics
Games as a whole
I just don't understand how the industry is failing women as a whole as much as it's failing comic books, games as a whole.
Also, please don't make threads to shit on women's issues.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Movies are my #1 entertainment.
-----
BDS: Horror film has violence directed against women.
Horror has sex with men.
Comic books are rape.
Comic book is rape.
Comics are rape.
Comic book is rape.
I don't understand the media being filled with violent imagery.
-----
CranberryMuffin: That's the sad part, I believe it is a pretty common sentiment in the entertainment industry.
-----
NarohDethan: Now you remember that movie where the protagonist is a girl who is abducted by her daddy.
-----
Puck Beaverton: The one where the writer/director kills off the main protagonist.
-----
CranberryMuffin: Would you say that?
-----
Lunaray: I think we're missing the point here. There is a real problem with a lack of accountability in the industry. If a film author/director wasn't horrible, then that could help get the conversation started on what it is to "destroy" people.
It's a serious issue in any industry, and that's why it's gotten more attention recently.
-----
JABEE: No, this thread is about the sexual violence in the entertainment industry.

CranberryMuffin: I don't think this is where I'm coming from. I'm not looking to talk about sexism or anything like that. I just think it's really inappropriate to talk about this subject with people who are looking for a way to

~!~Films you truly loved but didn't know what to put on your plate

malyse: This may be a weird thread, but I have to first confess. I loved, but hated, films that I knew when I was a kid. I mean, I knew what the name of the film was before I even saw the world. Like, I knew how to dance to it. I just kept thinking "this is so cool". Not that I didn't know what the film was or that I wouldn't like it, but this was a film that surprised me by making me so emotionally invested in it.
I legit don't know why I started watching this.
So today, I went to see Filmfest, my first film event in years. I was so excited, with so much to choose from, with so many movies and so many to choose from, that I ended up watching The Complete Works of William Gibson. I only liked the first film, but I loved everything else. I love that he was able to exploit themes of love and hate, of existential dread, of love and hate. I love that his themes are rooted in human nature, that he can use the human condition as a script for his own ends. I love that his endings are so natural, that even the neverending trinity of nature and nature's cycle is treated so well. I loved the sense that I was watching something that a god-awful nightmare, but I could also be a genius.
And then I watched this.
I loved this movie so much that I was literally brought back to life in a way I never would have been.
I loved that this film has a ultimately happy ending. There's a scene where a group of kids are going camping and they're fighting a bear. It's a scene that will never be topped:
I loved that this film has a final ending:
The movie has tremendous potential. So much potential. I'd love to read feedback from people here on ERA. I'd also love to see what other people here think of the film as well.
-----
Rackham: I loved this movie. It was the first thing I watched on Netflix. I remember being blown away. Loved the ending.

~!~PayPal question

NakedSnek: I’ve never heard of a PayPal, so I’m wondering if they have an explanation for why the fees for my debit card go through after I pay? I’m on a European Union (SB) debit card that’s blocked in most of the rest of the world and I’m getting the “no accept no charge” charge from a number I’ve never heard of and they’re covering a small fee. Are there other countries/regions that use their services?
-----
Nabbit: I'm actually curious about this too. It appears PayPal do support a small fee (usually around €) each payment card charge. And that's it.
-----
Nabbit: Thanks for the answers so far. It seems like it's a small fee, maybe about €?
-----
Nabbit: Sorry to bump this to bump the thread, I just listened to the audio for about 8 minutes and it was absolutely ridiculous.

~!~Are the Avengers: Endgame Cinematic Universe's main focus set to reveal the final scene in Avengers: Endgame?

bananafactory: I have been really interested in this plot for a while because I've seen people theorize that Thanos' vision of the endgame is that much of a focus. It's quite likely that Avengers ends with the Avengers setting up the Endgame, but even if that is not the central focus of the movie, the main focus still needs to be within the same universe. 
So, are we supposed to believe that Thanos was right about that the Vision's last words were true? At what point do you have to go and show the Originals that could not be detected under a rock? 
The Endgame teaser is too vague to be an actual tease, but I'm curious about the Endgame's official timeline.

~!~What are the most devastating, unexpected car crashes you've ever had?

brainchild: I'm in the process of making a long long cry too. I've been a wreck myself and I have a lot of stories to tell, but one of the most devastating crash I ever had was my car going into the side of a mountain. I had a lot of insurance with that, and even got auto coverage from the state of Iowa that denied me a home in the area, and I was in a fairly rough neighborhood, and my insurance company did give me a pretty good monthly payout, and I later went and told them that I just had a really traumatic experience, and that I don't necessarily want to end up in a nursing home forever, so I'm not gonna be able to deal with that in a few years.
I've had a few other car accidents too, but they were so bad, and I didn't know it was my insurance company.
So, Era, what are some of the most unexpected car crashes you've ever had?
-----
Zukuu: I had a rear-ending/crashing car while at work at first. I was very nervous, but I didn't want to end up in a nursing home, because I was in such a rush to get home, and I didn't want to end up in a nursing home.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I had a car accident in Yonkers, New York, a few months ago. I had a front-end crash and the passenger side of the car had a broken rib, and the car's head was presumably blown over. The rib was relatively minor, but the injury was pretty bad. The crash itself was rather impressive; I had just gotten my car totaled, and my car moving so fast.
I have a lot of friends who have front-end accidents, so I get them on the news a lot, and they're always happy to hear about them.
-----
brainchild: Yeah, I've had a few too, but I don't know if I've ever been in one.
I guess I just wonder, why am I on the news every day?

I think it's a great song, interesting chorus, and I think it's a classic.
-----
Taki: I just listened to it a few hours ago, was a little disappointed by the English version.

Taki: Oh, I was hoping there would be an English version.

BronsonLee: Yep, searched for "SADame no SADame" and it's nothing

KHarvey16: I mean, the song came about as a parody.

I am not familiar with the lyrics of SADame but I can tell the melody is very similar to "Sweet dreams"(music video by pop group).

Kirblar: I've seen similar arguments come up in the last few days about "no fucking shit, it's a movie" or "blackface is not a thing" which is not a surprise.
-----
Dalek: I think that’s what triggered the main point about “no blackface” protests.
-----
Dalek: I didn’t mention that this is the first time I’ve seen someone use this argument.

~!~Next Wave of the Digital Movie Junk

SArcher: This article is a long time coming, but I feel like a lot of the hype is just right now, but I know there's a lot of money involved.
How does this wave of the movie junk compare to the other movie junk that are popping up?
I know that there's a lot of people that love Star Wars, and it's a fun time, but I feel like that trend is going to fade away. I'm not hyped for a movie to finally be released, and I'm not excited for a marketing campaign to finally launch, so I'm not excited for a marketing budget to finally see the movie out everywhere, but I'm excited to see a movie that finally gets the hype train rolling. 
What are you excited for?
-----
Deimos: Movie releases this year.
-----
Harp: I can't wait. I'm in the middle of the third season of Blade Runner, going through the ritual of just waiting for it to come out to my friends and family.
-----
thekonamicode: Sequel to Star Wars?
-----
Kevers: I'm excited for any film that will finally see the light of day.
-----
Booki: I'm just waiting for the day the movie becomes available to stream in all the theaters in the world.
-----
entremet: I remember when I watched it. I like movies that are just a small part of the story.
-----
SArcher: I just want to say, that's a good shout. It's an exciting time.
-----
Fury451: I'm glad to see movies that finally do something interesting that isn't just another popcorn flick. These days I try to read up on the film in the time before I buy it, which is why I'm excited to see a film that isn't just another movie.
The Dark Knight is next to me in this department.
-----
Scullibundo: I believe that the first big blockbuster of 2019 will be the first.

~!~What's the best way to watch the entire season of Dragon Ball?

NTGYK: So I recently started watching the whole season of Dragon Ball, and it's just...miserable.
I've also just bought the Netflix Disney Play that includes Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, so I'm looking for something to watch the whole season through. This is the only option for those that want to watch through with the cheaper option, but not sure if they will let me stream the whole season.
Any options ERA, or someone here has seen?
-----
Silfer: I think the only option that is suggested is a Stream, but that’s probably not going to be practical.
-----
Zalman: Streams the whole season
-----
Buckle: Maybe I'll go with a free stream from the local cable box.
-----
NTGYK: No, a stream would be only a couple of hours.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I think the streaming option is a good option for you. 
It is the only option for people that want to watch the whole season.
-----
Slayven: I have never watched the whole show
-----
MrSaturn99: I'm not sure if you already have, but I'd like to be able to stream the whole season through Amazon Prime Video.
-----
Mesoian: Almost.
-----
Dereck: No problem.

~!~‘You have no one to protect you from’: A Twitter user takes on the terrifying reality of hate speech on the platform

Piecake: And lets not forget the fact that Twitter is a machine for straight up racism and bigotry.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: That's crazy.
-----
Apharmd: Now that's some scary shit.
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: This is a fascinating read.
-----
JCHandsom: Read it earlier today and thought it was about a teacher named Anne and the hate speech she'd written herself, so I'm not sure how this thread went down.
Edit: Oh and on point, Anne with all the hate she's written up already in that article.
-----
SabinFiguru: Yeah, I've seen this before with a coworker and it's really bad.
-----
WrenchNinja: This is what I assume is the source of the story. They hate each other because they're literal racists.
-----
Alucrid: those tweets are from 2015 but they're not from 2017
-----
JCHandsom: It's Anne's tweet too.
-----
SabinFiguru: "you're a woman who hasn't had a good upbringing and a husband in 18 years". 
I think that's the exact kind of person who wrote that article.

====================
~!~What is the most memorable scenes in television series?

Cybersai: I started watching Friends with the Meatballs a few weeks ago and decided to watch some of the most memorable episodes by shows. What are the most memorable scenes in television series?
I think the last scene is the one that really sticks out to me is the fight scene of the last season with the Red Skull.
-----
HStallion: The Office in The Wire.
-----
Cybersai: I think the one where they go to the bank to arrest a bank robber.
-----
BDS: The "Fight Scene" from the last season is where I started to wonder if it's even the most memorable scene from the show or if it has a lot of good(!) moments.
-----
Agar25: The used the word "fight" a lot when referring to major scenes, because it can be a good or bad thing. The stuff they have in the books can also be memorable as well. So you’re right when you say the most memorable fight in the series is the one the partner team uses in the finale.
-----

Krejlooc: The Black Kookaburumi
-----
Cocolina: I think the final battle in The Office
The End of the F***ing World
-----
Cybersai: The ending of the F***ing World is probably the most memorable fight in any show.
-----
a916: The ending of The Blackcoat's Tales 
Or the ending of the Sopranos.
-----

====================
~!~I thought Donald Trump was a democrat until today.

Uzumaki Goku: I mean, in all honesty, I thought Hillary was a democrat until today. I just checked and her 2016 campaign site is a democrat while Hillary Clinton is a Republican.
So, I thought that the last thing I saw of Hillary Clinton was a democrat. It's not that hard to see that after today, we've seen a Republican president and a Democrat president in many years. Is it really that easy to see that progressives like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are not only decent people, but surprisingly good people?
When I look at the term "Democrats", it's always Bernie Sanders. He's the only progressive I can think of who is not a Democrat. While Hillary Clinton would have been a "Never Trump" candidate, she is the only one I can think of who would have been better than the guy. 
So, I wanted to ask you all, what do we think of "Democrats" today? And why do you think they're not Democrats?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Not a democrat.
-----
Puck Beaverton: Trump is a Republican.
-----
Kasai: A right-wing "movement" that wants to de-platform and de-stall a candidate because they believe that "Democrats" are a bunch of raggedy old white dudes with automatic rage or "birtherism".
I mean, they're the only ones I can think of that aren't "nazis" and "social justice" people like they are.
-----
Zeno: I thought it was the same as the 2016 election.
-----
Powdered Egg: They are both socially progressive.
-----
Zeno: Well, they're not Republicans.
-----
WaffleTaco: Why would you want to insult the democrats?
-----
ObiWan: Bernie and Sanders are a good combo in my mind.
-----
FTF: "Not a democrat"

~!~What is the biggest mistake a moron can make?

Deleted member 1258: So I was playing around with the notion of adding a poll to the thread for a reason. I was going to add a poll to see if we could come up with a winner, but I came up empty for some reason and decided to just do my own.
I mean, I have a few choices, but most of them are pretty nonsensical so I'm going to make up my own.
1. The Big Bang theory
This is sort of a dumb thing, but it's fun to think about so I would like to share it with you. The universe was just a big bubble of a completely different kind of reality that we're in.
2. The Big Crunch theory
This is a more logical theory but it just flat out doesn't make sense. It's the theory of a broad universe where everything is connected but in a super weird way. That's why it's super rare to even see one of these things.
3. Natural selection
This is the famous two factor mutation as in the two different goings of a variable but the selection to select from the groups of mutations are so wide that it's impossible to get a statistically significant result from the experiment.
4. Natural selection by luck
This is the famous two factor mutation, but it's a more luck based variation that's more likely to be a good or bad thing.
5. Randomizing a personality
I actually made this thread because it seems like it's not even close between this and the Big Bang theory. The only people I've met who have the Big Bang are random people I randomly came across and I'd like to see who came out on top.
This one just seems like a bad choice because it's more luck based than either of the other two.
6. The Big Crunch
A random experiment that I randomly came across came with the possibility of two groups of people from the same country but one group could be the same person but the other could be the same person but the second could be the same person but the first could be the same person but the second could be the same person but the third could be the same person but the third could be the same person but the fourth could be the same person but the fifth could be the same person but the sixth could be the same person but the seventh could be the same person but the seventh could be the same

~!~Which is your favorite Harry Potter book?

Bor Gullet: For me, I have to go with...
Bloodline
It's a love story. It's not a kids tale. It's not Harry Potter. But it's still a Harry Potter story.
I'm a Harry Potter guy, but I also love everything that goes into them. I'd probably go with...
Bloodline
...but it's also a love story. It's not Harry Potter. It's not a kids tale. It's not Harry Potter. But it's still a Harry Potter story.
-----
Bor Gullet: I have to go with...
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I've only read Harry Potter but I have to go with that one I posted in the OT lol.
-----
Milo Rambaldi: A good love story. It's not Harry Potter. It's not Harry Potter. It's not Harry Potter. (There's a legitimate reason for this right now, but I'm not going to spoil it)
-----
Bor Gullet: It's not Harry Potter. It's not Harry Potter.
-----
JaeCryo: I'm a Harry Potter guy myself. I have to go with...
...
...
...
I'm a Harry Potter guy. I have to go with...
-----
Reven Wolf: In for anything and everything Potter.
-----
Bor Gullet: I don't have any Harry Potter books that I've seen, but I'm currently on Book 6 of the HP series.
-----
Laserdisk: No Harry Potter?
Bloodline, Deathly Hallows, Firewall are my favorite Harry Potter books because of the quality of the quality of the writing and the way they balance the multiple storylines of the books.
I know 100% they are not Harry Potter but it's good enough.
-----
Bor Gullet: Without question!

~!~NYT: How Trump and his cronies Misinterpret the "New Deal"

ImTheresaMay: As I've mentioned before, the idea that the EU is somehow tied to America is a very flawed comparison. It's also a little bit of a stretch to think that, if the US did the same thing with Brexit, that the same could be said of the current US governments proposed "deal" that Trump and his team wants. At the very least, the NYT's piece offers a convincing argument that the EU has a real say in the domestic and EU policy-making, not a lack of a sound plan.
-----
Xando: This is one reason why Trump is going to jail.
-----
signal: The UK government is gonna be playing Putin's daughter.
-----
Richter1887: Good.
-----
Kotto: This is a great read.
-----
Ac30: I’d rather not be surprised if trump and his cronies interpret “leaving peoples knhches to their stomach” as “the civilized country” when it comes to the current global stage.
-----
Wackamole: Yep.
-----
Kotto: Good.
-----
BowieZ: As an American living in Russia, that sounds like some shit.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I can see it as being similar to the "New Deal" which is "anyone can just as well as you are as long as you are rich as hell".
The "New Deal" was merely a way to get more money for the rich but it was to be "for a long time" so to speak. 
Trump's new deal, to me, is a form of the New Money. That is, a form of "New Release" or "New Watch as We Get It", a way to get the money to pay for the "New Deal". That is the "New Watch as We Get It".

lidmat: I don't know what to do. If we put our animals to sleep he won't wake up.
-----
TheBeardedOne: You'll need to make the dog do something with a few things. It's not a good dog.
I want my dog to do something smart with some money, and live in a house that's not a terrace and eat food with him.
-----
THEVOID: It's a smart dog. I would work with you to make sure that it's smart. But he doesn't want to eat.
-----
Duffking: On one hand, the dog will easily do whatever the dog wants to it. On the other hand, I applaud the dog for being able to do whatever it wants but I wish I could do so.

Surfinn: You'll have to make him do something smart with it. He can't eat anything easily.

KojiKnight: Make sure he can do whatever he wants to the dog and it will be perfectly fine.

More_Badass: So I'm going to try to spell tonight to celebrate the release of Infinity Wars.
I can only spell in 2018, but it won't be because I'm a bad person. I know they used to promote a new campaign that was using the term "Black Dynamite" and I tried to stop myself from dying laughing.
I'm actually going to try and make an English spelling of this tonight to celebrate.
I'm so glad I did this.
-----
Ravelle: I know it's 2018 and I still use a spell check checker so I don't have to do it too often, but it has been a help to me as I try to remember the right words.
-----
KojiKnight: So no.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I know it's a big ask to spell but I just don't really have a clue how to do it right.
Just worded this for you, so let me know.
-----
CountAntonius: I used it to pronounce it West Tyr.
-----
Seductivpancakes: Was it pronounced like that?
-----
KojiKnight: I'm going to say it's from West Tyr.
-----
Verelios: I know it's a real pain in the ass to spell when you're not used to it.

Bramblebutt: I'd say the last time I used it was when I was younger and it didn't work too well.

-----
Sectorseven: I'm not sure about the villain. I hope he does justice.
-----
BWoog: He's certainly going to keep the role. The only thing I'd rather he didn't do is have Optimus Prime be the evil counterpart to Shock. Shock was the only thing I'd want to see in a movie.
-----
Slayven: He's terrible, but I'd like to see a new Evil Dead
-----
Pachimari: Looks fun, I'm in.

Khanimus: I'm in.
-----
AgentChris: I want to see Rogen playing a uber douchen.

I guess I'll settle for someone like Matt Damon/Lorena.

Enzom21: Full article here: 
The piece is long but worth discussing.
I'm not too familiar with the history of technology and it seems to be a fascinating world of free markets and bubbles.
-----
Sjay1994: I mean, it's pretty obvious.
And it's not like there's some absolutely massive "own the space for evil" type of connection between Silicon Valley and alt-right.
-----
Foffy: The real question is why do they think they do?
I think "own" is trying to profit off of something.
-----
uzipukki: And you're not wrong.
-----
Khanimus: People don't buy into the "This is how liberty dies" narrative. They buy into it to protect their privilege.
-----
Hamchan: Every so often I wonder why people are able to get away with this shit. I can't think of a single example of anyone doing it ffs.
-----
capitalCORN: It's always been like that. Every so often I wonder.

shnurgleton: It's not the kind of thing that would have a monopoly on the web, but maybe they should keep it around
-----
Yerffej: This is a good thing for society, I'm convinced.
-----
PogChamp: I don't understand people who think they're more connected than they actually are. The entire point is that they can get away with anything they want. Everything else is an adventure beyond our wildest imaginations.

I've already started to learn Japanese from scratch, but it feels like I'm passing it up.
How do you get started?

It was awesome, I'd love to do more.

jcs: I just started learning Japanese from scratch for work with a client.
-----
The Albatross: I learned Japanese from my mom in the 90s. She had a Japanese lessons in her classroom. I didn't know it at the time, but she had a bunch of original Japanese stories in her books. I'd imagine you could also learn some Chinese from some of the stories, like the tales of the lion sleeping with a tiger or some stuff like that.
I've been studying Japanese for a year now, and I'm in pretty good shape. I'm doing just fine, but there's a lot of interest going on.

Vermillion: I'm in the work place now, so I'm a bit lost on what to say to a question like that.

-How would you get into and/or out of Japan?
-How would you learn the language?

-----
onadesertedisland: The GOP just isn't the same goddamn house we had last time.

Fork: And this is why Trump won't touch Hillary or the Dems.

Widdle Puppy: I'm not familiar with Paul Ryan's comics and know that he obviously focused more on the political side than the fact that he was "all of them". What was his position?

TheLostBigBoss: They didn't have a "no talk, no play" sign in my area.

TheLostBigBoss: People like to chime in, but this is a joke that is being pulled right now

Mr. Giggles: Fuck the city of Philly

~!~Bojack Horseman Season 3 Teaser - Coming January 18th 2018

Razgriz-Specter: So this is not a trailer.
So is season 3 the start of a new series?
Also, I hope it will take place after season 1.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I feel like the first season was slightly better than the second season.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I loved 1st season and loved 2nd season so I'm down for this.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Also why is season 3 the start of the new series? I thought it was just the first season
-----
verygooster: I'm not entirely sure why I'm looking forward to this.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I hate to say this but season 1 was the first good season of Bojack, I just feel it will be a lot slower than 2 or 3
-----
RedHoodedOwl: Watch this on Netflix now.
-----
TheGreatDirector: I'm really excited for this.
-----
rsfour: finally, good news!
-----
torre_avenue: Wait, this story is happening?

====================
~!~I just discovered a gift that I really miss....

Rand a. Thor: So I was just relaxing during a break watching Daredevil season 3 and realized I accidentally bought a PS1 controller and it gave me a PS3 spinoff.... I know this is common knowledge and pretty dumb but at the same time I just feel like a weirdo ... I mean I can't imagine what would happen if you actually bought a spinoff game. Like I can't imagine going into a store to find a controller with a controller with a PS3 in it and not realizing that it has a spinoff. And then I spent thousands of dollars to get a spinoff controller in there and... I can't imagine what it would be like to go through this....
-----
Squarehard: Do you have a similar experience?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: No, but I have grown up with it.
-----
Marcellus Wallace: You did the right thing
-----
Ryaaan14: I bought a Wii controller for my brother to play Halo Wars
-----
Tambini: WOAH WOAH WOAH

chandoog: I have a spinoff called "The Star" from the Wii Sr. What is it suppose to do?
-----
Khanimus: No, but I have grown up with it.

Rvaan: I bought a PS1 controller for my brother to watch Kirby Wages.

~!~'Avengers 3' to drop March 8th.

BrokenFiction: 
-----
Bus-TEE: Well I'm not sure what the MCU was until I saw a trailer.
-----
Slayven: The chances of 'Avengers 3' being a good movie are only a slim 1/2 of what they were expecting. Just a shame.
-----
Lopez: So wait they delayed the 3 months to April 8th?
-----
Shugga: Never seen em so I dunno if I'll see em
-----
thediamondage: There's a lot of Marvel Studios, there's a lot of Star Wars, there's a lot of other stuff out there, and there's still a lot of money made. You don't need a billion dollar franchise to make a movie.
What's the point of this series? Sure, I'll see it, but it's not going to make enough to fill the theaters or any of the big blockbusters.
-----
Breqesk: I think we've been talking about it a little for a few days now, yes. It's kinda dumb to call it a 3 month series after the first two, but hey, at least we've got at least a few good things to come out of it.
-----
Buckle: It's going to be a fun movie.
-----
just_myles: If this is a train wreck then they aren't going to release another 3 movies.
-----
Sandfox: Just fucking SAY THAT AND WE'LL ALL KEEP MAKING THESE VENGERS.

~!~FBI investigating connecting fake Saudi fund maker to money laundering

Airing of Grievances: 
-----
shnurgleton: Sure. That's a start
-----
Dennis8K: This is the same guy who ran a fake "Saudi Renaissance Fund" that ultimately pumped out Russian Treasury bonds in an attempt to boost President Putin's authoritarian status.
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: This is a start!
Who's behind this?
-----
The Albatross: I'm not sure how much is fake and who's funding it, but apparently the Saudis.
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: So as I was saying in PoliEra, fake is not the right word.
-----
WedgeX: A good start.
-----
carlsojo: I'm beginning to wonder if the Saudis have the money to be as shady as Putin.
-----
Kolx: They're probably a direct business partner.
-----
Dennis8K: So how much do they get out of it?

~!~Michael Keaton to play Michael Jackson in "Hereditary"

Pachimari: Keaton is making a cameo appearance for the first time in the Michael Keaton film "Hereditary", directed by Wong Kar-wai ( Get Out, Crazy, Stupid & the Dude in the Movie). The film is based on the novel "The Way of Kings", so Keaton plays the exact same character.
The movie is also in theaters now.
-----
JB1981: Keaton is a good guy.
-----
TaleSpun: “Michael Keaton”
“Gravity”
“Shameless”
“21 Jump Street”
-----
Slayven: Why was this not titled Get Out?
-----
Khanimus: "Bronx gave up the fade"
-----
Slayven: I hope he's a happy guy
-----
Pachimari: He's playing "The Way of Kings" in the film.
-----
Slayven: I am a sucker for the wink
-----

~!~Do you like Naruto?

fluffydelusions: Just randomly decided to watch Naruto anyhow and it is still pretty good as hell. The art is cool and the ending is great. I love the way naruto treats its enemies and its just a story about Sasuke.
I also like the way its just Naruto doing his thing with no one to stop him.
Naruto vs Madara
-----
Heroin: Yes, I think the battle Naruto had in the manga is the best version of that story.
-----
HStallion: I liked the way the manga introduced Sasuke to the world and the way it slowly revealed that Boruto bit off his less than perfect ass at the seams.
-----
Richter1887: I like Naruto because it has a lot of good aspects to the story that are glossed over a few times over other series.
-----
Cybersai: Naruto is just a bad ass.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah, he's just a bad ass.
-----
Fulminator: Naruto has some really good moments and it's fun to watch some fight scenes that are just bad ass
-----
Bronx-Man: Naruto is the best. It’s not a fight every round, it’s just part of who Naruto is.
-----
Richter1887: Nah it is part of the character.
-----
GMM: Yes, I find Naruto to be the best in the series.

~!~I haven't watched the Red Letter Media Trilogy in a while, what do I do?

WarpSpeedMolasses: It's been years since I've watched The Red Ladies, but I've finally been able to get into it. I'm about 3 episodes in (the most I've finished in a long time) and it's so addicting. I love the show. I feel like it has layers. Nastiness, depression, a dark side, a lot of it. The characters are all likable and relatable. I'm not a huge fan of mecha anime, not interested in that.
However, I'm curious, what do I do? I'll be watching the new Avengers movies too. 
What are the best series of Red Letter media ever?
-----
The Real Jeremy: The Matrix is really good, but I think I'll watch the rest. I'm interested in the Red Letter Media Trilogy, but not sure how to feel about it. I might go back and watch the rest at some point.

I can’t imagine the pain and shock that this must have been. It’s caused me to reflect on how I approach family and myself.
My condolences.

Hierophant: I'm sorry for your loss OP. I feel for you and your family.

CeeCee: Sorry for your loss OP.
I'm also sorry for your family.

Hierophant: I was thinking of getting a home equity loan to help pay this out so I could afford to lose both of my kids. I know, it's hard to swallow all of that money, but I just think about going out and losing both of them and then something happens to you.

~!~The Atlantic: "The most depressing statistic about America's relationship to the labor market is unemployment": Older people are not happier with their wages

AcademicSaucer: Gallup found that a majority of Americans now see “unemployed,” meaning those who have low job satisfaction, has a negative outlook for life.
The report found that 76 percent of respondents to the Older People Study see unemployment; 76 percent to the Marr unemployment-related statistic was used among American adults ages 18 to 44.
The survey was conducted from mid-July to last August by Gallup.x
More at the link.
But why?
Start doing less stuffs. That's the new American Dream!
-----
Kirblar: That's...shocking.
-----
The Albatross: Sounds about right.
I'm not paying much attention to the stats, but the idea that we're seen as "lazy" is pretty depressing.
-----
The Albatross: Unemployed? Why?
-----
Foffy: More depressing is spending money on stuff that makes you "lazy".
Suffice it to say, being American is not very nice.
-----
Mr. X: Work has been consistently bad for middle-class Americans. Not to mention the jobs themselves have been awful for the working class.
-----
Knight613: It's a good thing the working class is seeing that the working class is being attacked.

DonShula: That’s not a great high paying job...

~!~How do you deal with remembering your first name?

Russell: I recently had to deal with this. It's really upsetting.
I don't want to sound rude but this is actually upsetting lol
My first name is Araki
My last name is Araki
I used to call myself Takuma but I've changed it to Gengoku and I still have the Gengoku suffix.
I don't know if it's normal to change your first name but this is upsetting.
-----
Heromanz: You don't
-----
Betty: You don't and you should be ashamed of yourself OP.
-----
SigSig: Nail if you're too weird for the Gengoku suffix.
-----

Coyote Starrk: I always get the gengoku suffix.
-----
Chopchop: I'm going to be honest. I don't even know which one I think of.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't have a name, but I wish I could. I've forgotten my name a lot over the years, and have never met anyone for the Gengoku suffix. I guess I'll just forget.
I don't remember my last name, which is weird since my last name is Araki, but I have a name that's been on my birth certificate for a long time.
-----
HammerFace: Yes, I did the same thing when I was younger, I just got out of it a few years ago.
-----
Terraj_RSL: I always get the gengoku suffix, but I think it's weird to change your first name.

Hate: What are some of your favorite starloot songs?
I'm gonna start with my pick.
Every time I hear a song with a rap verse, I always think "what's the point of this song?" and I don't know why. Just because it makes it easier to listen to.
My favorite is Candykart, I love how their verse adds a bit more depth to the song.
-----

Hate: This one is fire
-----

itwasTuesday: I don't know why but I love that video of the kid running across a pile of coins.

-----
Knight613: It's actually really sad how many people fall for that stupid shit "I want to make tech better and more ethical" shit.

brawndolicious: Steve Jobs was tortured and killed by ICE. 
People shouldn't do this shit.

Hollywood Duo: That and Soros

But yeah this is pretty damn scary stuff.

~!~Why do people have so much trouble understanding English?

Memento: I am trying to understand the meaning of this video.
-----
subpar spatula: Because they're bad at it.
-----
Baconmonk: Because the other person either is a liar, or they're too lazy to use a real translation.
-----
Azraes: Because English is hard to learn. You're either a bad liar, or your other brain is letting you get away with a lot of bad habits.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: Because it's easy for people to read text without a second thought. Lazy/impulsive people are the new fafhulhu.
-----
Olaf: I don't understand how you can understand that OP.
-----
1000 Needle: Because it's harder to understand than a lot of people who could.
-----
WaffleTaco: Lazy or impulsive people are the new fafhulhu
-----
Powdered Egg: Just because you can understand something doesn't mean it's easy.
-----
Kmonk: Why do people have such different or confusing ways of saying the same thing? Why is it that when we're speaking with the "other" or "them" we're trying to understand?
I like to think that, if we could understand each other, we can still talk, because we're trying to be different.

~!~What's done in your country to make it better?

Gustaf: coming from the people who are most disappointed by the US electoral system.
what do you guys think?
-----
Beartruck: I don't think the US has done anything better.
-----
Heshinsi: The people voting in the US have done a good job of turning out in the UK, so I’m not surprised at all that the US tries to push itself as the better option than the EU.
-----
Syder: Voter suppression, yupp doing that.
-----
The Albatross: I mean, I can't guarantee that the US has. For example, a lot of the people I know who vote in the US tend to be conservative, which makes them very reluctant to push for change. 
But there's one study that actually just looked into this, and it looked into that the US "fails to change" on a variety of demographic factors, so I have to assume they've got it down to .
-----
Bramblebutt: The US has lost a lot of political capital since Nixon.
-----
Ashlette: This is why people in Poland are not surprised by the election result. Nixon didn't help and Poland is a hell of a lot better built than the US is.
-----
Gustaf: i like the Pags for being so right, but yeah, we shouldnt be against change in the US
-----
Dingens: The Pags are mostly populist - they're a nation with a tradition of philosphology, i.e. the classical thinkers who fought and won, but the conservative political establishment was always going through the motions and was essentially complicit in the rot. The Pags have been the butt of numerous jokes in American history and in Latin America, but I think their success would be a historical footnote for them.
The Pugh are mostly moderate and left-oriented, which is what I would think of. The Pugh are also more in the modern political predicament of the time, and they often go through the motions the way Trump did: the loss of the Irish and the French. But yes, the Pugh are modern losers who are in their 30s, whereas the US is certainly in its late 20s.

I do in America. Do in the Netherlands too. Though I've pretty much lived in the US since I was a kid.

Raxus: I kind of like the idea of this being about Kylo Ren. But it's not the best film.

Andrew Korenchkin: Article
I think I'll take Avatar the Last Airbender over Pokemon. Considering both the value of its characters as well as the sheer quantity of media it has been produced with, I can't be out of touch.
-----
BrokenFiction: I like Avatar.
I'm not the biggest Avatar fan, but I love most of the shows I watch on Netflix.
-----
RolandOfGilead: I'm a big Pokemon fan and I also really like House of Cards.
-----
CormoranStrike: Pokemon is a close second. House of Cards is a close third.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: House of Cards is second only to Avatar
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: It's not close, at least not by a large margin. House of Cards is a close third.
-----
Doomshroom: Avatar is good but not by a large margin. I mean lemme make a pokemon thread.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: I haven't watched season 1, I think it could have been the best if it was only 4 episodes
-----
RolandOfGilead: I don't know why but Pokemon is by far the most popular show of all time. It has always been a huge part of my childhood, I think because I was always raised on a very simple base. House of Cards, while still very good, has gotten worse over the years and isn't as ingrained as it should be.

KojiKnight: Pokemon is way, way better than House of Cards.

~!~What's the best way to purchase and stream music digitally on Spotify?

SlickShoesRUCRazy: I'm looking for a way to buy seasonal TV shows, movies, games and etc. It's probably not a very common purchase for sure, but I would love to buy a physical media collection to stream when Apple releases the apps. It'd be a good way to catch up on all of the shows I missed from my youth. Music purchases would also be great, as I'd like a way to get some new music to try and keep up with the shows.
Thanks in advance!
-----
BDS: I would suggest the direct stream option, it is available through Apple Music and Spotify.

metsallica: I'd suggest the direct stream option. It's all streaming for me, but you can't buy a physical album directly from Apple.

-----
Slayven: The Disney Story is a dvd only with a tape player
-----
jett: I loved it. 
It had a lot of awful music, and there were no good characters, just bad-tempered teenagers.
-----
Optional Objectives: Only seen 1 movie.
The Disney Story is probably the best Disney story, period.
-----
Gunny T Highway: It was a great kids movie.
-----
TheCthultist: In a different world, that they could actually make into a movie...
-----
Z-Beat: I don't remember anything about it.
It's the most favored Disney story.
-----

Disco: Pretty dumb video game, but the music was like a dvd and the movie was fun enough that it can be considered the Disney story.

JusDoIt: I used to love Your Name.
But then it got kinda boring and boring for a while.

What say you?

-----
incogneato: The Monsters are the best.

Wizard of Oz is the best, but The Monsters are the GOAT.

~!~Why is it so easy to get laid in the middle of the road

Morrison71: And why is it so hard to get laid on the flat ground when you’re on it and you’re not looking forward to your day? I’ve done it a couple of times and it wasn’t a problem. I’m curious as to why this happens.
-----
Funyarinpa: I go through experiences where I get laid on the flat ground and I'm just staring out the window
-----
Dishwalla: I'm not sure I'm supposed to be looking forward to a day later.
-----
FUME5: Because you're in the middle of the road.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I used to get laid on the flat ground a lot when I was younger, but I've been lucky enough to not have to try to get laid.
-----
Deleted member 36937: Because we can't get laid on the flat ground. 
I was lucky to be born in the middle of the road.

~!~Favourite film to watch (A Bad Man, Citizen Kane etc)

fairz: My absolute favourite movie. I just watched it yesterday and....it wasn't even close to as good as the critics were saying it was. Maybe I am the only person who likes this one?
Anyone else have fond memories of this movie?
-----
TheBeardedOne: A Bad Man
The man was played by an older actor, and his performance was pretty good.
I don't know if it's a film I have ever seen, but I watched it for the first time a few years ago, and it just hit me.
The man was played by Mark Hamill, and his performance was incredible, I recall there writing off the performance when he first showed up.
He was great.
-----
TheBeardedOne: The film has some good performances, but it doesn't have lots of them, and I'm sad that it had so much bloat.
-----
Dook's Revenge: I've seen it once, but I wish I had gotten a chance to watch it sooner. That was one of the best movies I've seen, and I just wish I had gotten a chance to watch it a few years ago.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't remember much of the film, but I liked it quite a lot. I think I'd call it one of the best of the year, but I also would like to see more of it.

~!~The left is losing weight again, but they still lack muscle mass, the right is right warming up their eating habits

Taki: This is an interesting research if you ask me.
-----
DJ_Lae: I don't know if you're talking about the average person or the vast majority of dietitians.
That said, I do believe the left is losing weight, at least in the short term. But it's going to take a long time to regain muscle mass and build back muscle some.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: The "right" is "turning our bodies into wheels."
-----

JaeCryo: Hahaha
-----
Powdered Egg: And the "left" is still weight gainers.
-----
Wackamole: Pretty good picture.

~!~Which Book is the Best

Daffy Duck: So I’m going to be doing a book series starting in the fall, starting with a small group of people that are interested in reading a lot of different books and going through their wiki.
I’ve got quite a few things planned for this year, some more then others, but what I’m looking for is more sci-fi fiction than just the usual fantasy/marvel stuff, and I’m open to anything as long as it’s not really about books in general.
I’m mainly looking for sci-fi, no drama at all, just good stories that I’m made to read.
I’m a fan of Greek myth, so any suggestions are welcome.
Would love to see some suggestions on the genre, genre busting tips, examples, links, videos, etc.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: German prose?
-----
Daffy Duck: Thanks. Have made the list and will try to find it.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I had a copy of Greek Mythology but not the best english language material I had access to.
-----
Soundscream: The best way to read any book is the English editions of the classics.
-----
somerandomweirdguy: I mean, this thread is way too broad. I'm going to be trying to get a French translation of the best book that I could so if you have the time, please pm me.

Soundscream: Maybe he's too high profile though.

~!~Natalie’s Ex-lawyer Says She Is Too Old to Get a New Son

Wondergal: Full Story
-----
Heshinsi: Sounds like a very fine line to walk.
-----
VorpalNonsense: I just read an article about her and the two kids she had that adopted two little kittens. She said they were fine with it. She also mentioned that the adoption is very expensive.
I've seen some very odd comments from the adoption agency here in Sweden. Most are just the adoption agency not the lawyer. I was not expecting a report of a malnourished kid.
She is now a lawyer anyway, and if she wants to adopt it will probably be in the cost of the adoption itself. That's why I'm annoyed because I don't really trust her with the job of being a lawyer.
-----
Zelas: This is a good thing. She should feel like she has no choices.
-----
nihilence: B-but adoption agencies aren't real.
-----
Birdseye: Don't give up on your kid. Always look for a new adoptive mom.

Gattsu25: This is crazy.

djplaeskool: Now, this is a bit of a myth.
I don't think this has ever happened, but I do think it's fucked up that he's in jail for creating a social media account to post the news and not a reputable news source.
-----
Luchashaq: I thought he'd plead guilty for a few more years.
He was a bigger piece of shit a couple years ago.
-----
Fork: I thought he was guilty until I saw the video
-----
Supercrap: So it's not like he was never in prison
-----
DJGolfClap: So, the excuse is that he did this so he could be released from prison in a few months, and that he was making his crime a nuisance to hide his undying hatred for Donald Trump.
-----
Nassudan: I really don't know what to say to this.
-----
Fantastapotamus: Glad he's free.
Like, what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
-----
Falconbox: I think his conviction hearing was a couple months ago. It's not like the judge was beating him to the peels either.

~!~The U.S. Resistance

riverfr0zen: The Resistance
The U.S. has faced genocide, oppression, war, repression, exploitation, and terrorism hundreds of times greater than the U.S. itself. We are here to help you. Join us.
Now, I'm not your average "You can talk about whatever you want to about the past, but you can't get a good list of achievements, achievements that are not a positive reason to talk about the future" thread. I'm here to talk about the past. The present. The present is a constant stream of horror, pain, frustration, and despair. It's better to talk about the past with the present than to have a present with the past without any positive reason to talk about it.
I'll start.
The early 2000s was not a good time for the United States.
Between the early 2000s and the mid-2000s, the United States had a huge economic crash that led to many small towns and rural areas to shut down, leading to an additional wave of people moving into the country. A lot of the people who had been living in these areas through the entirety of the previous generation were either born in the country or have relatives who moved there. Many of these people are dealing with PTSD and working through the social network, but they are also dealing with a very real social stigma today. This introduces a lot of negative aspects of life for most Americans.
I'll go ahead and talk a bit about the current state of things. The first point to really discuss is the current status of the US.
The recent Trump Administration, and the recent decision by the FCC to kill Net Neutrality has torn the US apart. The decision was made after the Obama Administration, and is the reason that this thread is here. I'm not saying that the Trump Administration was able to do anything positive, or that it didn't do anything negative. I'm just saying that the current state of things is a very scary thing to look at.
I'm not just looking at the current status quo here. I'm looking at the current situation. The current situation has made decisions that don't make good sense, and that's the reason for this thread.
I'm not here to say that the current decisions of the US government have caused you to feel differently. I'm looking at the current situation as a whole.

~!~[UK] Can I use a CC help thread filter etc?

Stuart Gipp: I'm getting a filter that I've not used before. I've read it's called the 'N' line, and it's sort of a pinhole filter, but I'm not sure if it's 1.5mm or 4.5mm? Also, what about the colour?
-----
fluffydelusions: I use the N filter for street signs
-----
Stuart Gipp: I'm getting a filter I think it's the N line.
-----
gutter_trash: use the N filter to filter if your street signs are yellow.
-----
Stuart Gipp: I was just about to post the same thing, but then I remembered I've had one for some years and the colour is very off-putting.
-----
Gowans: The N-line is the darkest I've used.
-----
Powdered Egg: Use the N filter I got for the N'line. You'll get just as much colour as a regular N filter thanks to the darker pigmentation in the light.

uncelestial: I'm in my final year of college and I'm passing the NHL draft. I know very little about them, and I'm trying to plan my next moves out - my focus will be on hockey, but I'm curious how much everyone here loves baseball.
Any advice for what I should watch?
-----
siddx: Where are you watching?
-----
shnurgleton: I am not a sports fan but I do like watching sports. I used to like watching football but I can't stand the smell of it
-----
Mcfrank: Hiking to my local mountain
-----
uncelestial: Hockey. I've never been a hockey fan but this is the answer.
-----
mrtl: I don't really watch any sport outside of baseball. I've been a fan of the game for almost 30 years and I've never been a hockey fan. I love watching hockey and one time my brother was playing a game I just lost my balance and I fell down on the floor. I know what you mean.
-----
SteveWinwood: I love sports and love hockey. I was just in there for a skate and it was good.
-----
Uncouth Norseman: The best way to learn about hockey? Go to a hockey game.

MrNelson: baseball. They're a bit different from other sports, but hockey is by far my favorite sport.

More_Badass: Ron Howard is a fucking savage

-----
Spectromixer: Looks great, I look forward to it
-----
The Albatross: This is going to be great. 
This looks like a real shame on most movies from the Stallone family.
-----
hodayathink: I have a feeling the film's going to be good. The name of the movie is a reference to the original, so maybe they'll at least be showing some of the lessons learned from it.

-----
Javier23: We can't escape the world we see itselves in.
-----
KimiNewt: Well, it's not about a better world. It's about the globalization of the human mind.
-----
Zoc: I mean, it's a form of mind control. But it's not the first time someone has suggested China could build a wall around the entire planet.
-----

-----
Kernel: This probably needs to be corrected for the US thread.
-----
R0987: I mean, I don't think it's possible without using a program to control the mind, I think it's possible to make it possible. But I think China's government does have the right idea as well.

HStallion: I think it's about the ideology that leads to despair and subservience and I doubt anyone in the west would want to go down that path.

~!~Should I watch a Mural?

Grimminski: Rian Johnson's Mute-Out series for a dollar.
The dude has a heart of gold, and is a verald gentleman who is just a dad and doesn't know what else to do. He can stand in front of a monitor and look at his kid for hours, and he's still got it.
I would rather have a movie of him doing the things you see in movies, not watching some Oceans 11-style set piece.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'd love a movie of him doing stuff like this
-----
Grimminski: No thanks. I love you.
-----
TheBeardedOne: No thanks
-----
Grimminski: I'd love to watch that
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'd like to watch a movie of him putting on his shoes and running.

I'm actually kind of torn when it comes to indoor/outdoor activities.
So, I'm looking for a place to go for a while to play around in the desert, but I'm open to any suggestions, so please share your stories, pics, and links if you have them!
It'll be a bit of a tough call, since we're in the middle of summer (what currently is a bit of heatwave), but I'm open to anything.
-----
VeePs: Do you like hiking or do you like cycling? If you're just going to be in a town for a day or two, why not a round trip trip trip to someplace in the desert?
I'm going for just a day trip probably though.
-----
Squarehard: Going to a nice cabin with a cabin crew for a day around sand dunes, maybe even a trip to a volcano.
-----
HStallion: Are you looking for a place to play domes or something?
-----
A Fish Aficionado: Maybe try to relax?
-----
Lotto absolutly: If you like the outdoors, why would you want to spend a day in a town full of derelicts?
I would love to live in a town that doesn't have a lot of derelicts, because the desert is awesome and I know I'd love to be an individual in that desert
-----
Turtleboats: I love the outdoors but don't want to live in a town full of derelicts.
-----
Squarehard: It's a two-day trip to a nice volcano, though I don't think it'd be enough to get out of the desert.
-----
Squarehard: I'm not sure exactly how it'd be like in the suburbs, but I'm sure the average person would just stay inside and not worry about too much noise or weird stuff happening in the town.

~!~Is it possible to stop the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature?

TheGamingNewsGuy: In many ways it is, but it is very doubtful in quite some way. The Academy have had this much respect and respect for their performances in the past - including some that have a bit too liberal liking of Academy Award winners. Since the recent judgement - in particular Matt Jackson - for bad film nominated American anthems - it seems that something is wrong with the Academy and they are going to have to correct it. 
I dont know if this is the case in just films , but I have felt that the animation for Academy films has been getting much less animated recently. With some films like the new Fantastic Mr. Noah and Logan, the animation has been getting a bit more tolerable. The movie Mr. Noah is getting a bit less of a lot of critical acclaim and a few other films have gotten even better
Is it the case that animation has been getting more popular? I think the movie The Last Jedi is getting a lot of critical acclaim and it has had some big hits 
I dont know but just in terms of the critical reception of said films, I know that is a good thing. I just dont know if it is the case in just films
-----
Puck Beaverton: No, it’s not.
-----
Yams: I don’t think so.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah, I would say that it is the case in just films
-----
NecroTechno: No, it's not.
-----
Kingpin Rogers: It's a bit hard to believe, but I think it's more likely that the Animators took the love of it and just made from it to make it. It might just be them spending more time animating to the point where it's a movie they're quite proud of.

The Albatross: I've always wondered if a large Mac is supposed to be regarded as a dessert, or just a snack?
I consider myself pretty picky with desserts, but I think a large mac is a snack, and it's something I'd like to try again sometime soon, but I'm pretty picky about it, especially if it's something that many people enjoy with me.
-----
Fat4all: i usually eat large mac things tho
-----
Teh Hamburglar: You sure that's a snack? I'm not eating a big mac right now, just getting one out of the bag that I can get drunk.

~!~Last Argument for the 'Caste System' in Britain

Occam: First published in: 
Most common use: "A system of which there are no more than two men, to exercise the same rights over multiple partners".
-----
Zvonimir Boban: I'm surprised I'm still alive to see this discussion even if I didn't think it was a big deal.
-----
L Thammy: I look at this from the same angle. I believe a system of which there are no more than two men is a far bigger deal than simply any rights granted by a woman.
-----
Occam: The point is that even if the European social democrats had the same system, the whole system would not be as progressive and there would still be a lot of problems.
-----
ChaosXVI: I mean if it's about rights, it's all get get pass.
-----
Occam: Some liberals identify the problem and want to have it go away.

Cocolina: The only thing worse than a left-right system is a democratic social order that is not ruled by fear and bigotry.

~!~RTTP: Beast Wars

DosaDaRaja: So I used to watch this show a lot when I was young but boy did I fucking miss it. I was not a huge anime fan, mostly because I could not comprehend the writing, subtleties, and gore (which, as a mature, mature, non-normative, anime, I'd rather watch than be bothered by).
But as an adult, I really dug this show. I think it could have been a lot different with more likeable characters and better animation and character designs.
But boy was it a damn good time. What I think is saying is that it could have been a lot different with more likeable characters and better animation and more likeable characters.
-----
ShaggsMagoo: The first season was the best show I've watched all year. I recommend it to anyone that hasn't watched it. It's so freaking good.

There is also a spike in the number of people going to work or school. They are getting more busier which is good for business.

~!~If you could change anything about how cars governed, what would it be?

Golden: I think cars will change anything that a manufacturer can think of. Not sure how I feel about motorcycles, cars, cars, cars, but if old suits were given the go ahead, they would probably still be old. I think Olds' suit was as much of a departure as those of the new suits (unless you consider the fact that it's cloth so it's not leather to be a change).
I suppose as long as the manufacturers are not too scummy about it and trust each other, it's not strange to have a car governed by the standard of the road.
-----
Fantastapotamus: Just deal with it
-----
TarpitCarnivore: I think the original question has a lot to do with the fact that life will never cease.
-----
Thordinson: Old suits are cool, I like the idea of them being worn upside down though.
-----
Nerdkiller: I like the idea of cars being used as "poney" when they're built.
-----
Rangerx: Old cars are cool, I like the idea of "pony" motorcycles.

Fantastapotamus: You can change the theme of a product so you can make it look like a new car but it will also change it. It's like a music change.

Nerdkiller: I think this is a pretty good answer. I think the rule of thumb for motorcycles is that the roadway is an environment in which the motorcycles are in effect.

Dude Guy: I'm sure this thread will be filled with auto-pilot bullshit.

Kthulhu: Old motorcycles are cool, but they are also a big part of the reason I like cars so I'm not sure about that.

~!~Do you believe in the Green Lantern Corps? (Rumor)

TheGamingNewsGuy: I was watching Lantern Returns and I saw a fan making alot of the same arguments again and I was wondering what do you think, does he believe in the Green Lantern Corps?
-----
Khanimus: No, he thinks in Green Lanterns movies.
Tomb Raider was a big success and so was Batman (and so was Flash) and Spider-Man.
-----
Shao Kahn: I think he's right.
-----
HStallion: A friend of mine once said "I barely even see Green Lantern when I see the movie" (I'm in the middle of the movie).
-----
torre_avenue: So, we can have that group of superheroes and super-villains that are all based on characters that are related to each other and have the same problems we see in the movies.
-----
Khanimus: I think the Green Lanterns movies are just a pile of us vs. them bit. A lot of us just want to be good.
-----
entremet: Yes. They're films.
-----

TheGamingNewsGuy: I think so
-----
Slayven: I think they are only like 20 or 30 years old?

~!~I can’t hold on to my $300 Nintendo Switch :(

FernandoRocker: I can’t hold on to my $300 Nintendo Switch :( :(
I think I have to buy it in a day. I’m so used to keeping my own consoles, I don’t know how to keep them active anymore. I have my PS4, Wii, and X. I just bought the X-band 2 controllers... I don’t know if that will last me more, but I don’t plan on keeping them active any longer.
I feel like it was time I got something new... I don’t know how to keep them active any longer. I don’t know if that will last me more, but I don’t know how to keep them active any longer.
-----
FernandoRocker: I’m sorry. I don’t want to buy to continue my subscription. 
I’ll look elsewhere.
-----
MC-MC: I just got this not too long ago. Paid $90 for it and I love it.
-----
Avis: Yup, I have it on my back and I just want it back.
-----
jcs: It's a lot better than I expected. Got a cheapo model, and my PS4 is pretty much worn down. I still have my current console and I'm not too happy about it. I don't know if I need to buy a new one, or change the name. I just don't want to sell it, so if I do, I'll gladly sell it.
-----
FernandoRocker: That's the kind of advice I would get from my gf, who has a pretty smart and financially successful business that pays out of pocket for every console.
-----
bruhh: The price is going to be too much for the 4K version, tho...
-----
Einchy: I don’t know anything about Nintendo systems or hardware.
Yeah, I just wanted to say that it’s a horrible situation, but I can’t really hold on to it.

CrazyAndy: Just got this today. I was shopping for something new so was browsing the web, but then realized I forgot my money. I

~!~Conservatives are ruining democracy.

mutantmagnet: I think the right have created a "new" government by going full in on ACA repeal. They do this because it is unpopular with their base and won't get the popular vote thrown in the side.
Going forward most of the conservative policies won't be as popular because they are unpopular with their base and most conservative government plans won't be as effective as others.
The left can be a great coalition and the right a bad one but it is idiotic to go all in on ACA.
-----
Muppet of a Man: Conservatives are fucking idiots. They're all racists, sexist, bigoted, cruel, bigots, and bigots because they're the only ones who can pull it all off.
-----
gcubed: these people are so fucked up
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Trump's base was already in on this.
-----
subpar spatula: The only thing left in modern politics is the horse people.
-----
snacknuts: The left is so fucking stupid.
-----
HStallion: The right is so awful.
-----
Kirblar: The right is mostly a bunch of right wingers. They don't really stand for any shitty policies the left wants or needs. They just want to be left wingers.
-----
Kernel: Conservatives are on the right. 
Left wingers are mostly a figment of their political idealism.
-----
Foffy: This is what happens when the "good old days" of racism and outright bigotry are over.

~!~Trump: I would be the first president to have a female chief of staff

ElectricBlanketFire: This tweet is from September 2017 and according to numerous people close to him, it's still in circulation:
The article also goes into some detail about the disastrous February midterm elections in Georgia and how Trump won:
-----
Pwnz: Not sure how much evidence there is that he cares.
-----
pbsapeer: So he’s a guy who is against female staffers? Good for him.
-----
Sagroth: Keep the hatred in schools, boo boo.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: What's the proof?
-----

Wulfric: I would definitely be the first?
I mean, if this was the first time, I'd look forward to it.
-----
borghe: I mean, this is his first time in office. I'm not sure there's the logic behind the idea. Trump's a tough guy, the loyalty is to the president.
-----
Hollywood Duo: I wouldn't doubt it is a goal of his that he lost the election. The only reason he lost is because democrats did not show up to his inauguration.

ElectricBlanketFire: I'm with you.

~!~The best 'what the hell' GIF?

Heshinsi: Today I will be watching the best 'what the hell' GIF of 2017 in the context of being a fucking dick.
It's not just a GIF, it has to be something more like, a character that shows you something bad in a different way than what the GIF says.
For me it's probably the one from the Boogie Brothers.

~!~The future of the Simpsons

The perfect Dark: I am not the biggest Simpsons connoisseur, but I always thought the show was pretty good. I watch it maybe once a year and while it is onCBS I am constantly getting reminded of the incredibly good quality production.
However, I am curious to see if any other classic Simpsons characters are going extinct?
-----
Cochese: The future of the Simpsons.
-----
TheZynster: Crankin' chairs
-----
apocat: The future of the Simpsons.
-----
Thefuzz: Just watched the first season, I'm in love.
-----
Shugga: The Simpsons is still the best thing on TV
-----
Nacho: The Simpsons is still the best thing on television, but if it was a CW format it would be dead as soon as i saw the damn show on cable.
-----
Mushroomer25: I thought it'd be interesting to see how long the show ran in the mid-60s, up until the end. It's certainly not a particularly fun show to watch, but I might just skip it entirely.
-----
GringoSuave89: The Simpsons is still the best thing on TV right now.
There is no reason to think that the show would go away any time soon, especially if you were never a huge baseball fan.

Baji Boxer: This was reported in my news feed.

hjort: I wonder what the cause of death was. That's something I've wondered about for awhile and need to check back in on.

Dekuman: That's awesome. Hope the recovery is fast.

Dennis8K: I can't believe it happened so soon after being shot.

Volimar: Good ol' 8 million dollars in unemployment benefits.
-----
shadowsdarknes: How did she get unemployment benefits when she was 14?
-----
Volimar: Well, she was going to receive more than half a million when she died at age 47.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I am shocked to learn that such a person would get unemployment benefits when they were 14.
-----
Volimar: And to think how generous they were to someone who died a hero.
-----
Volimar: To be clear, no one ever gets unemployment benefits when they were 14. It's not a matter of "immigrants", it's something different in CA.
-----
Hollywood Duo: There were no benefits for 14 when she died.
-----
Squarehard: So it's more of the "I was 13 and I had a nice job, but I had a pretty good job when I was 14 and I didn't have a girlfriend when I was 18" crap.
Still not that generous to her at all, though.

AcademicSaucer: The Turkish government is warning Americans about being U.S. citizens, and they're treating the Americans the same way as they'd treated Americans a quarter of a world removed.
Doctors and nurses are subject to U.S. immigration raids each week, the U.S. Coast Guard is called in for medical personnel at all other times, and the Coast Guard’s Medical Inspector General has been called in for raids every day and a half. All of these are paid for and reimbursed by the U.S. Government.

fluffydelusions:

Terminus: I feel like this has happened to me before.

DigitalOp: It's hell yeah. People just want to go home?
-----
Socivol: Yeah, I feel like I've been living like a worm that ate my own tail. I just want to curl up on my side.

EdibleKnife: Yeah I’m also going to have to buckle up. I’m so used to driving late at night as a kid I’m scared to even see the outside of my window. It sucks.
-----
Wzrd: It's crazy how long it goes. I've been to a few D.C. events recently and they're usually terrifying.
-----
smoothj: Fuck that is a nightmare.

Bob Beat: I've only been out of town since January but I've been going to a ton of the city for the past few weeks. I need to get home and check my parking spot but I'll let you know how that goes.

~!~What's the best place to get some professional Photoshop work?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I'm looking for professional Photoshop work that I can use on my Surface PC, without spending a weekend in Photoshop and could be worth looking over.
I think I can import it into the Surface PC via FTP, but I'm not sure whether importing it via Windows PC or to a machine running Windows.
Any recommendations?
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: A friend of mine did this which I wish I could get him on a surface PC, but I don't know if he did the Photoshop.
-----
xxracerxx: I think it can be easily obtained online.
-----
wzinta: There are so many options now.
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: I tried a few different options, none of them work. I'm not sure if I'm missing some with how to export to a PC.
-----
xxracerxx: What's the only option for importing?
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: The only option is the PC.
-----
xxracerxx: Any good resources?

WarpSpeedMolasses: If nothing else I just want some Photoshop pics that I used on the Surface Book before I threw my old Photoshop rip-off away, but they would be fine.

xxracerxx: How do you do that?

~!~A recommendation for a Windows based laptop from Best Buy is getting old.

Steven Universe: I’m looking for a desktop laptop for my coworker. I’m looking for a Windows based laptop to sell through Walmart. I’m not buying a refurbished machine anymore. I think it's time to upgrade my computer. I know the Dell XPS 13 is my recommendation. 
Just wanted to say thanks for asking. It’s been a long time since I’ve used a desktop laptop and I remember when my parents used it all the time so I didn’t know what to expect.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: Look into the Dell XPS 13. I've been using it to play a little Minecraft game and it's a great laptop.
-----
Steven Universe: Thanks, I don’t know if that counts as a laptop as well. The XPS 13 is really old and I used it for a longer period of time.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: Mine's 4 years old. Just a couple of years old.
-----
Consequence: I got a Surface Book 2 that I paid $34 for and I think it's worth the upgrade over the XPS 13 (which I also got for $40).
-----
FaceHugger: Have you looked at your PC's CMP settings? They say this is a revision, which is the sort of thing you might ask if you're running something similar but not exactly using it.
-----
Rodney McKay: I use a samsung s9 camera. I'm thinking another camera, maybe a Core pro?
-----
Dio Over Heaven: If at all, it will be better than the one I got for a bit over 200 bucks I paid for it for the last year.
-----
Rodney McKay: It's the same camera & the CPU, same ram, same gpu (by far the best I've seen), same color screen, same processor.
-----
Consequence: I just got a new one for $200. 
It's not a laptop, but I'm pretty happy with it.

====================
~!~What do you think about this remake?

The Almighty Tria: This is a wonderful, wonderful idea, I want to see more of it. As much as I love Breaking Bad, I think it's a legitimately great show, but I'm starting to get a bit annoyed with the tone of the show. I guess I'm just getting a little sick of the show, with all the horrible people and shit that happen in the world and everything being shit takes a toll on. 
I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper as the bad guy in The Man from UNCLE, and I'm not a fan of this reboot. I don't know, I'm starting to think it's going to be a mess. So what do you think?
-----
JadedWriter: I liked the first one, enjoyed the second. I don't know if it works.
-----
Bitanator: I enjoyed it, i was a bit fed up with Jesse basically playing "I'm the guy, everybody else is the problem"
-----
Volimar: I liked it, but I liked that the main actor was a fat guy and all those things were pretty obvious.
-----
Creamium: I liked it a lot, it was good fun, but I thought the original was pretty great. I thought it had a lot of potential.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I think it's a great idea, the story is fantastic, and the characters were interesting. I'm thinking about changing it after a year of having to watch the original again so I can see it all.
I'll have to look into it.
-----
BDS: I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's got issues, but I think a remake would be a good thing.
-----
BDS: I did not like the original, but I think I like the remake more than the original.
-----
Retroarnold: I'm a big fan of the show and I noticed the tone back in the day when I watched it. It is a big change for the show. I remember the show being so bad and it just didn't need to be to be.
-----
Einbroch: I liked it a lot. I don't know if the tone should have been tonally changed.
-----

====================
~!~Am I the only one who thought the WWE was a really bad show?

JoshGonzalez: So I just watched Raw this morning and I was watching the main roster, and there was a lot of "no way, they're better than WWE" stuff thrown around.
I know people have their misses, but I think the WWE is a much better show than WWE.
I still think most people in the US would agree that the main roster is bad compared to the main roster in WWE.
I think that’s why I think the main roster is so good.
I feel that the biggest issue in the WWE is that they don't have a good roster.
That’s why I think they should improve their roster.
-----
Indelible: I think they have a good roster but it's a bad roster.
-----
Heromanz: Yes
-----
Troll: I’d say the main roster is awful but it’s a good roster.
-----
SupremeWu: I think it's a good roster.
-----
Dysun: That's what I was thinking.
-----
Fork: You're not wrong, but if you look at the roster of the main roster WWE has a problem with is really bad.
The main roster of WWE is a work in progress.
-----
jbug617: The high and humidity matches on the WWE Network are awful.
-----
MrChom: WWE is a terrible company. The main roster is utterly awful. The gimmick is great and the talent is great, and it's just all so bad in a way you can't help but compare it to working conditions in terms of the level of uncompromising bullshit they throw out.
-----
jbug617: They've got the good matches, they're awful.

~!~Is it necessary to have a hair plug for your car?

ElectricBlanketFire: My girlfriend has a perfectly rectangular one. She also works in an office where it's not necessary, and I think a hair plug is unnecessary.
I was just wondering.

The Albatross: I have one right below the nozzle. I've never fully appreciated the use of it in my car, but I'm going to keep it for sure.
It's not necessary, but it definitely helps.

~!~Godzilla The Live-Action 'SeaQuest' Had The Best Reaction Of Anyone In Anime (Article)

TheGamingNewsGuy: SeaQuest is a live action animated anime series based on the 2011 manga of the same name. The series is about a group of people who are sent back in time to the past who fight against an ancient monster called 'The Sea King'. 
They are friends in the previous series who go to the past with the people they met in the past and present with people their level of experience meets in the present. The first season ended with the protagonist Yuna...which ends in a tragic ending. 
The anime is not only about the battle of Yuna and the mysterious existence behind it, but also the battles the group encounters while in the past. 
The anime is a lot more serious in it's messages about the past, about the struggle of past vs the present and about what goes into their hearts when something happens in the future. 
The anime also has a side story about a boy who wants to become an underwater ninja and find the ancient weapon The Sea King. There are many times throughout the anime both during the past and in the present. What do you guys think about it?
-----
Yukari: Love it.
-----
Aadiboy: Love it.
-----
4cute: I liked it and I like the story, so I'll probably finish it
-----
HotsauceDragon: I loved it, and the story was great too.
-----

-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I liked it
-----
Yukari: It's about the same age as me in the past, 7.5 years
-----
Aadiboy: So that makes sense.

~!~How much do you spend on food?

Maxey: I tend to eat relatively perfect meals, but I'm pretty picky about what I eat. It's part of the reason I'm an extemulate driver.
What is your budget?
-----
John Kowalski: I don't have friends.
-----
Cybersai: Zero.
-----
tadale: A lot, especially the food I eat out of the car.
-----
Fat4all: like 10-15€ a week
-----
MrChom: Depends on how intensely I want to eat it. I'll eat out of a box and just drink the drink out of a glass. I don't really care what's in it. I don't care what taste I have. It's just not healthy to expect people to buy a certain food because it's not healthy for you.
-----
cwmartin: Depends on the food I don't eat, but I do tend to order ahead of time my portions.
-----
maxxpower: Around 3 to 4 cups of coffee every morning.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Around 350g of coffee every morning.
-----
Cyanity: I spend way too much time in bed to eat out.
I'm also not a fan of water or lard, so I tend to add more water to water and milk.

~!~Is this the greatest comedy moment of all time?

ASleepingMonkey: Was watching my college co-workers' work, and they had their eyes wide shut and laughing at the top of their lungs. It was as awesome as it sounds, I can still hear their laughing out loud right now.
Am I the only one to notice this moment?
I think it was great.
-----

TheAbsolution: Reminds me of that scene in The VVitch where the red headed ex-pats boo boo loses his shit and decides to act like a jerk.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Funny. I remember hearing about it for years back when it was airing and watching it on TV.
-----

Dook's Revenge: I'm not sure if it's the best moment, but it's definitely up there.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Yeah. I think it's a great one. Now if you can think of better words, please.

Nappuccino: It was a great moment for sure.

~!~Do You Have a "Plan"?

Bobo Dakes: You know, I always felt like I was always in the mood to sit down and have a discussion on something, but I don't really know any way to "plan" it. 
I'm not talking about making a list or telling everyone you're going to the "final battle" of a game, but "how far you'll go" and a general idea on how to actually progress from there.
I never had any real plans. I just wanted to learn something to come up with and make a plan. 
I'm just curious, what tips and suggestions do you guys have?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: No.
-----
chandoog: No, I'm not.
-----
djplaeskool: Fuck no.
-----
Ganransu: No.
-----
Mest08: I never understood the point of "plans" really. 
Plans are people though, so I have a pretty wide variety of interests.
-----
Stranger Things: no, I don't
although I guess we've had some really dumb discussions on this forum about this, so no, I don't plan to start a "final battle" like I do with many other people

~!~The Satanic Panic in Egypt?

MisterHero: I'm watching this video from BBC, one part of the 20th century show. One of the victims is Moses Musa, a Qadian (Qadian from the name of the Qadian tribe in the Book of Exodus).
Musa was a Qadian, a Qadian tribe in the Book of Exodus, a descendant of Qadian and Qadian rulers. They were a secretive Qadian people and ruled with secrecy and with secrecy. They were also secretive and ruled with secrecy, but this was because they didn't want to be exposed to the outside world (the outside world would know they were Qadian). They also thought Moses was a trick, because he knew that Moses was a trick, and he didn't want to be exposed to the outside world.
Mosaic was also a Qadian, but this is how he was able to control the world and was able to manipulate the whole Jewish people. He was pretty much a symbol for the secret society, but this was also why the book of Moses was so important. Moses' goal was to seduce the face of Moses, to seduce the face of Moses so that it makes it part of God's plan for the rest of mankind. He was very greatly admired by the people of Egypt, because he did not want to be a god and wanted to be a tyrant.
After Moses was seduced, he made an attempt to murder Moses, but he didn't succeed because the murderer is a snake. So it's been a long time since I've seen anyone mention this.
I've seen some Qadian videos online, but they're not very good. The most interesting one is the one about a young boy (I think he had a shaved head) and the moment he heard it, he died.

====================
~!~I'm having my first webcam set up

SnakeXs: Ok so I have a fairly large collection of cheap and old-school ct/cg headsets. It's all about the headsets and the picture quality is good but I just want something that's of good quality. I'm looking at the Logitech C922, which is $160 on Amazon.
I went to Best Buy on the random good looking collectible card (I know it's not that old) and saw the option for this.
I'm willing to pay $250 for this, since I'm getting this for free. I'm getting two options:
1. Go to Target and get one of the nice looking clearance metal switches. The switches are metal, but the metal is easy to read/setup. I'd rather just take this one buy when it comes time to me later tonight.
2. Get the Logitech E-622
This one looks like it would be a nice one, but it's a bit more expensive.
What's the logitech switches here? How does this look? I don't know the manual, but I want something that's quick to input, and doesn't have a whole lot of settings besides frequency and aspect ratio. Should I just get something like the Logitech S-80?
These things are supposed to last forever. I'd love some that last that long, but not that cheap.
I'm willing to pay $300 for this, since I'm not sure the price is right now.
I'm also not sure if this would be more than good quality Logitech speakers. 
I'm not sure if this would actually improve the picture, but at this price, I guess it can't be that bad.
-----
ZOONAMI: Looks like you have to go through a whole lot of research and be a little leery to get what you're getting.
I'd probably just go with something like the Logitech M570
-----
BLEEN: I had a pair of those at the local Best Buy. When they died, they came from a return for them. Those were the equivalent to my current setup. So I'd probably get them from Amazon. Never had them. I think I had my replacement speakers from Best Buy.
-----
SnakeXs: I think they're the same price? I can get them for under $200.

Slarvax: I just started getting into the habit of browsing ERA and it is getting rather annoying to have people try to do this every once in a while. Every time I refresh I have to consider if I'll lose the ability to read text or what not in order to do so. It's so frustrating.

~!~How do you deal with loss of memory in the brain?

fireflame: I lost my memory of a long time ago and I have difficulties thinking about things. What is happening is that I forget lots of facts, small to the many things that I was exposed to during childhood. As a child I was able to hear every word of the day for about 10 years, now I only hear the minor details of everyday life. I also have trouble handling thoughts and feelings. This is the first time that I have had this problem. I do not know how to deal with it.
How do you cope with it? Do you try and avoid it?
-----
Sectorseven: I think it's just a matter of finding the right balance.
-----
BLEEN: I've had it for a long time, but I guess it's just different types of thinking. You can't shut your brain off for a long time, and the more time you spend in it, the less time you spend processing what's going on in your head.
-----
Dishwalla: you just go crazy. try and deal with it as soon as possible.
-----
neon_dream: I have no problem processing what's coming and going without forgetting things, but you do you.
-----
Chopin the Third: I've had it for a long time, but it can be so bad that I cannot process any type of information or emotions.
-----
SugarNoodles: I have no problem with forgetting something or someone important, but forgetting something will kill me.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's possible that it's a result of a change in environment, but I can't say for sure how severe it is.
I remember as a child, my father was a very accomplished pianist. I can't remember his name, but it's possible he passed away in some sort of horrific way during childhood. My grandmother died of melancholia from a very sudden and painful perspective.
I've also lost a family friend recently, and the worst part is the fact that he was my grandfather and he was our second cousin, and I always wondered, "Dad, how could I forget to bring my Mom to the bathroom when she was sick?"

Mugy: I'm a decent person, but I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know what is happening to

~!~The impact of the Brexit vote, how did you cope with it and what lessons learnt?

Meus Renaissance: As the vote nears, I'm thinking about taking a career in politics, but one thing I'm wondering is what lessons from it have led me to be more mature in my outlook on politics?
I'm going through a very difficult time in my life, and the effects of the Brexit vote have made me grow cynical, cynical and pessimistic about the world.
I've had a very difficult time dealing with Brexit; I think it's a massive societal problem, one that has to be worked out through legal action or through my own schooling.
If I had to bet, I would say my view on the vote made a large amount of sense in a limited sense, and I learned a lot from it.
I've learnt a lot about myself, my family and about myself through my schooling and interactions with others.
I'm anxious about the effects of the brexit vote, how I cope with it and what my lessons from it have meant in the modern era.
This thread is about my own education, what I learnt and what lessons I hope to take from it.
What are your lessons learned and what have you changed to improve your educational experience?
For me, the important lessons are:
Be positive, be positive, be positive, be positive, always be positive.
Makes me sound a bit stupid, but I'll admit, there are so many things I've learned over the years that don't make up my head.
-----
rstzkpf: Don't be afraid to learn from mistakes. Don't let anyone tell you "no, you're wrong".
-----
hydrophilic attack: i learned to be a better mongo fish
-----
Meus Renaissance: I'm a much more cynical person, and a lot of those lessons haven't worked out and I'm wondering if the lessons I learned from Brexit have any lessons to learn them.
-----
PJV3: I had to learn a good deal in school but learned a decent amount in Uni which was pretty much fine. Nothing major I took Uni, just a general overview of things.
-----
Spaced Harrier: I learned a great deal, if you ask me, from the referendum result.
I still think the EU is a bad idea, as it will affect us all.

~!~Eating a super expensive meal for $30 an hour

Sphinx: So I've been thinking about this and I'm fairly speechless... I haven't eaten a meal this expensive in a decade that I can count. That's how much I pay for my meals.
I'm in NYC and I can't even afford to eat at any fast food place here in LA (I live in San Diego). I'm pretty speechless.
Anyone else have stories or close ups about eating a super expensive meal for a low price?

NinjaScooter: Don’t eat fast food.

SolVanderlyn: No, you're probably crazy.

fluffydelusions: Yeah you should eat.

Widdle Puppy: Eat fast food
-----
SugarNoodles: I’ve seen this with fast food places. It’s something that happens in most places but it happens everywhere.
-----
jb1234: It's kind of funny. I work in a fast food restaurant. When I'm not eating I don't feel bad about spending about $30/person, but in a restaurant where I'm not ordering a $2.00 meal I feel bad.
-----
Hollywood Duo: It's probably just a knife, fork and spoon. You are not crazy.
-----
Linkura: Not really, it's something that happens everywhere. Burgers over ice? No thanks. Popeyes? Fuck no. Microwave? Fuck no. Dry fast food? Fuck no. Dry fast food.
-----
SonicXtreme: yeah, but the people that do it more often than not are the ones that abuse it more.
and also fast food places probably don't give a shit about calories and will just eat whatever is on sale, so usually theres always something tasty in front of the other food item in front of them... they aren't trying to be that.
though I guess the point is, yeah, some places may not like you but some will.

Tideas: I would like to use a mobile vue client and also have access to Vue/YouTube/Sling/etc. But I cant really think of any good reason to not use any mobile clients.
I've looked on the web and it seems like Vue/YouTube/Sling/etc has a lot of problems. I would rather not have that headache. 
Do you guys think there's a good alternative to Vue/YouTube/Sling/etc which I am looking at?
-----
Dicer: Vue for free.

Kieli: Vue + YouTube/Vue/YouTube TV are pretty much the same thing.

TheMadTitan: I use Vue, Vue for free, Vue premium for a month, Vue for $5 a year.

YouTube for free with a subscription of sorts.
Sling for free with a month.

~!~So, what do the Chinese do with the iTunes streaming library?

signal: I've been getting annoyed with Apple Music for the last few months and the library is definitely growing, but they've become pretty limited. Maybe they're just not as big as it used to be?
I know they're still popular on their competitor, Shomi, but it's mostly fragmented. Is Shomi not as good/decent as iTunes in terms of music sharing?
-----
Aquavelvaman: They just spent a bunch of time figuring out how to handle the sharing model. They've been laser curated music.
-----
legacyzero: I mean, I’ve got entire albums and tracks for free. I’ll pay for a subscription if I wanted anything else.
-----
signal: I don't know, looks like Shomi is in a decent place given they just want to share the albums with their "friends" (and for obvious reasons most of the music I listen to on Shomi don't actually come from China). I guess I'm just lost.
-----
Redhead On Moped: Shomi is not a streaming service but I just use their music library as my primary. Spotify is pretty much the only service that actually hosts it, so I can access the content on my PC.
-----
signal: I'm just hoping for the best for Shomi to be on the bottom of the list lol.
-----
legacyzero: Wow, they have a better selection? I’m still salty about that
-----
Mushroomer25: Shomi's been pretty absent-from-home-only for a while now, though. Their top 20 songs are actually quite good, but the rest just sits in the background.
-----
Hobbes: They've been laser-focused on their core business (albums, streaming, etc.) for decades.

~!~The best part of life? Fucking health scares

Russell: I'm in a unique position to make threads, so I thought it would make for this thread. I'm 23 years old now. The only reason I know about this is because I was diagnosed with major depression years ago. I had a really rough time with my family and friends, because they really didn't give me enough time to think and think, much less anything and more thinking.
I'm in a unique position to make threads, because I have two daughters and two sons, and I have no clue if I should give them away or give them away to my doctor. I'm not sure what to do, I guess I'll just give them away.
In my situation, I think it's just as important to me that they have something to gain from this life, for better or worse. My goal is to make as much as possible for them in the most honest way possible.
Life is nice. It's not easy. But you get the point. My daughters are getting a good understanding of the world and what motivates us to be there. They are my sons. I'll never "get it" regarding them, but I guess it's a way to support them.
But yeah. I'm probably feeling a lot of anxiety. I'm probably gonna feel even more anxious about things than I was about life. But I'm trying to figure out a way to cope with it.
Has anyone here gone through anything like this? How did it go?
