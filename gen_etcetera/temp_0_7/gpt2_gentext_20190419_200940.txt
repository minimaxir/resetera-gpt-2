~!~"The Frozen Movie" being remastered on Netflix

ReginOfFire: The remaster is going to happen soon!
-----
krazen: I am down.
-----
Admiral Woofington: The thumbnail is a bit choppy, but hopefully you guys won't have to deal with that.
-----
MMarston: I'm so happy this movie is getting remastered.
-----
Wren Wolfe: Wait, so are the remasters going to be like the old Pixar movies? I've always wondered if the remasters on Netflix are going to be similar or similar to old Pixar movies.
-----
ReginOfFire: I think I see the thumbnails, I can’t think of anything else
-----
MMarston: It's just a matter of how good they are.
-----
MasterYoshi: I always wondered why Disney is doing remasters of their older movies, but I thought they were just as good.
-----
kai3345: this is pretty awesome
-----
Savitar: Reminds me of the old Disney remakes that used to be made for the new Disney remakes.

====================
~!~The plot of “Bojack Horseman” and “Goosebumps” has a surprising number of similarities

Squarehard: I thought this would be a great thread to bring to the light, as many, number of films, shows, animation, etc have done with the fact that a movie franchise that has, always been, very much, very popular with the general public, has featured, among other things, characters that are, at best, relatively young, popular with the general public, and at other times, among the lowest grosses of things that were ever made for these reasons.
I thought this was a very interesting way of saying this, and, it does make for a pleasant surprise when you see a film come to that level, and, a rare instance of the trope that is actually not a bad thing.
I won't spoil anything of what this movie is about, otherwise, just saw it around Netflix on Friday, and it was very fun.
-----
DigitalOp: I saw this awhile ago, and it's just as awesome as the movie it stars. I loved it, and the characters are the best, but it's the overall plot that's weird as fuck. 
The humor isn't the best, and it's just not as good as the comedy bits, but it's still fun.
-----
hateradio: I think it's quite good, but it's not as good as the movie it stars.
-----
Squarehard: It's a good movie, but it's not as good as the movie it stars, no, just nothing as good as the movie it stars.
-----
Einchy: I actually used to follow this movie (I loved it too) and it was pretty fun. Then, I jacked it up last weekend and went to the theater for the movie. It was actually pretty good.
I've only seen the comic, but I'm not sure it's the best one.
-----
Scullibundo: Nah. It’s a mess.
-----
Laserdisk: It's a good movie if you like it
-----
HStallion: I've been going to see it on Netflix and I'm just glad it's not the 2000's. I've seen it multiple times but never thought to watch the comic. I'll give it a shot.
-----
Ashhong: I thought

~!~1.2 million British pounds spent on Brussels car park attraction in 2017

signal: BBC
-----
hydrophilic attack: the amount so far
-----
RailWays: What a load of bizzare shit
-----
Proteus: No shit.
-----
signal: Whoops, I meant the pound. Fixed.
-----
Parch: How can this be illegal? That's gross.
-----

Voyager: The amount I spent on that park attraction in 2017 is outrageous.
-----
Shao Kahn: How can so much for a decent cause?
-----
signal: It's not like this is the first time it's happened. It seems like most people who want to buy cars here would be doing so in the UK.

====================
~!~Y'all watching The Amazing World of Gumball on Hulu right now

janoGX: Watching this right now, and it's so fucking good. I'm addicted.
-----
ChrisR: I watched this with my girlfriend as part of a group vacationing in Hawaii. It's a super long 45 miniring, but we ended up watching it all by ourselves so we got pretty much wasted.
-----
Soda: Yeah, I watched it with my sister and we loved it. We also watched it with a few others and we thought it was pretty funny.
-----
shnurgleton: I watched it with my wife, it was good fun
-----
Dennis8K: I watched it with my dad and we loved it.
-----
Brandon: I read a synopsis and it wasn't very educational but it was very entertaining.
-----
Poppy: i watched it with my dad and some of the best scenes i have ever seen in a show
-----
Kuro: I watched it with my dad and we did not like the show. We thought this was a show about a group of people who are on the edge of their edge. 
Our favorite scene was when the leader of the group is telling his people that if they don't vote in someone else, they are going to kill them. I was like "who will they kill?!" 
The show is uh, fun. Will give it a watch.
-----
janoGX: It’s so good. I think it’s one of those things that is always being added to the list of things I’m watching.

~!~Nancy Pelosi: I don't know if I should vote for President Trump because I'd like him the fuck to run.

GK86: She said this on CNN today. 
Here:
-----
Psamtik: I don't know what her point is anymore.
-----
UberTag: Stop voting for stupid, racist, destructive, bigoted trash.
-----
Muppet of a Man: Nancy Pelosi is a fucking liar. She's saying that the 2016 Dem primary election where Republicans had a chance to steal the election, was a shit show. She's a fucking liar who knows her own lies.
-----
julian: She’s like the best anyone could possibly hope for, second fiddle.
-----
Surfinn: I don't think she's lying about that. She's almost certainly lying about the actual issue she wants to see fixed and the Dems can just sweep it without a single fuck up from here.
But yeah I think people are underestimating how much she means/hates about Trump.
-----
makonero: She’s a big dumb liar, and a vote for her will tell if the GOP can’t spin this as a good thing.
-----
Tovarisc: They are not lying about the shit they are saying, they are lying about the reason they say it.
They'll at least get a good shot at it if they don't do it early enough.
-----
Kirblar: Pelosi is a liar.
-----
Kirblar: From what I've read, she's not lying about the fact that she thinks the GOP have the power to do whatever the GOP wants, and she's not lying about the fact that the Dems have a history of trying to take advantage of it.
Anyone who says Pelosi is just lying is either a liar or a big dumb liar.

ManaByte: This is probably the most "in the world" thing I've read today.

Squarehard: This is Disney's way of doing things.
-----
StunnerZ: SHREK ARE YOU AT THE END?
-----
mreddie: I "in the world" MCU?
-----
Sibersk Esto: I'm not sure about the Shrek Cinematic Universe
-----
ManaByte: I'm going to guess the Shrek Cinematic Universe is one in a series of "shrek tv shows" based on Shrek.
-----
Fat4all: i am in the mood for some cheese cheese

~!~Boomer or bust! I'm rewatching all the Star Wars OT and I'm still shook.

Bronx-Man: This is one of those moments that I think of when I wake up. I've watched around 1,000 of these movies and sometimes I'll watch a few even though I know I don't have anything to watch.
There's a scene in Rogue One where Donald is watching a Jedi ceremony on his podcast and the crowd starts to gather. It's still one of the most amazing sequences I've seen in my life.
I don't know what happened to it but it was still one of my favorite scenes in any movie ever. I'll always have a soft spot for the scene.
What are some of your favorite scenes from any movie?
-----
Whitemex: I love this scene in Rogue One, and I still love the ending
-----
Wafflinson: The Last Jedi ending an old classic.
-----
DrForester: I'm in a weird spot. I generally don't like seeing how many "The Last Jedi" movies are made after the Disney buyout, but I'm in the mood for something new right now.
-----
Praxis: I love how the old Sith Lord was still a planetwalker, he was just a Jedi Padawan, but he was still a planetwalker.
-----
Sibersk Esto: I've seen 1,000 of these movies and I still love them.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I loved the opening scene.
-----
BDS: Poe's getting his time in space
-----
Galkinator: The greeting on the wall in Rogue One is awesome
-----
LakeEarth: The scene in TLOU is probably the most memorable sequence in any Star Wars movie.

~!~Dems layoff: 1,000 employees lose average salary of $8.6k

Squarehard: 
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: CROOKED ME!
/s
-----
Hollywood Duo: The party of small business owners
-----
Doom_Bringer: 50 companies laid off - a good start.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I've never had a salary decline as big an hourly pay drop as I did when I started my career, and yet every time I'm informed raises are being cut, the average salary they're laying off raises.
It pisses me off so much I don't even want to give them my money.
-----
PeskyToaster: I worked for a discount union when I first started doing work at Walmart. When the pay rate went up, the union voted for layoffs.
-----
Vincent Alexander: Oh, so less than 1,000 employees lose out to less than 20,000 employees? That's fucking stupid.
-----
Kirblar: 1,000 is almost the bare minimum, especially when looking at a larger number of specific jobs.
-----
SugarNoodles: The meager wage in the case of retail/small business definitely makes it worse.
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: It's raising my hourly earnings just about due to a recent financial situation.
Or the result of being laid off by a horrible employer :(
It's a shit situation hopefully theres enough resources to sort it out

GK86: Link.

RDreamer: Um....

excelsiorlef: He doesn't need a wall because he is too stupid to think "it would be a good use of all that money"
-----
onadesertedisland: Sure, he can't claim he cares about news, but he's in the business of covering it and not trying to hide it.
-----
WedgeX: He’s got a war on the media that’s as much trying to curtail government as,
Spoiler
-----
shnurgleton: Something something free speech
-----
excelsiorlef: He's not threatening the press when he's trying to protect his business dealings
-----
Buzzman: He was trying to protect his business dealings in the second half of his presidency.
-----
Kmonk: The NYT article is a good jumping off point.
Edit: Here's the AP story.
-----
jelly: He's the President and he doesn't have that luxury of thinking "what the press is going to do is do something." He's not threatening the press he's just trying to protect his business dealings.

Sokrates: Who’s watching this? I’ve seen them all over the world.

-----
Sign My Guestbook!: So...is Thailand going to ban the films? I know this is coming from behind the scenes, but man is it wild that a group of UFOs are using the Thailand main tourist spots as a jumping off point for their UFO hunting activities.

~!~How do you deal with dyshidrosis?

Russell: I have dyshidrosis (my ears are huge and they irritate me in different ways) and am usually in the chair. I have been sleeping on a recliner for the past week and whenever I'm awake I'm exhausted. I can't stand sleeping and sometimes I can't get enough of it. I'm trying to find a way to get rid of it but I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong. I have friends who have it so I want to thank them for their time and consideration.
-----
Kuro: I sleep on my back and my legs are on my lap.
-----
theofficefan99: I sleep on my side.
-----
Saganator: Mine is also pretty damn loud, I've been sleeping on the floor for ~3 weeks and I'm still experiencing this.
-----
B4mv: I sleep on my side, back and elbows/chin down.
-----
Hops: Side sleeping on a bed and a soft blanket.
-----
Russell: I just got diagnosed with dyshidrosis (audiance). It's pretty bad.
-----
B4mv: Damn I've never even heard of that. I'm thankful I've had a good bed.
-----
Cyclone: I sleep on my back, elbows/chin down, and I can't stand sleeping on my back. I have minor dyshidrosis and it's probably why I'm trying to get off of bed.

~!~Do you turn off auto-correct on an iPhone?

Spork4000: For the last two weeks Apple has been putting all of their new features on my iPhone 6s and just turned them off.
Off. Thank you autocorrect.
I also turn off auto- Correct trending items on my iPhone X.
-----
How About No: Yes, turn them on every time
-----
Mediking: Turn them off for me
-----
Cipherr: Yes, always. Never had an issue. It's so annoying to have to manually edit features to auto correct shit I don't know about.
-----
Tbm24: Yes, I turn them on all the time. But I’ve never had a problem with Siri in the past.
-----
Spork4000: I've never had a problem with Siri in the past, but this is the first time I've used it.
-----
Mediking: I've never needed them to turn off auto correct.
-----
DrewFu: Yes, I turn them on all the time. But I've never had any issue with Siri in the past.
-----
totowhoa: Tried the Siri feature on my iPhone 6s and the answer was a blank.
Turned it off in like 10 posts.
-----
DrewFu: I think I've just developed a new issue.

~!~Anyone else getting a pizza overload?

Curler: I have had salami slices a few times, and I'm pretty sure I'm chronically in the minority of opinions on where people can go wrong with them (too much sugar, etc).
I'm always tempted to go to another place, but the quality of the food is so... strange.
What's the deal?
-----
Kasai: I had the cheapo, it's good, but it doesn't taste like anything I've ever had before. I just can't stand savory flavor on pizza, and I can't get enough of it.
-----
Curler: Yeah, I get the "you just ate a slice of bread with a cheese grater and you're out to have some" galore. It's just... weird.
-----
nasirum: Yeah, I can't eat enough slices of bread with a grater. I'd rather just slice it up and eat it as I'd never eat sugary foods out of my mouth.
-----
Curler: Yeah... I don't know if I would ever eat that stuff... but I'm not living up to expectations.
-----
Poppy: i like salami and all but i prefer having my cheat ice cream covered in pickled onions on the side
-----
jcs: Had salami once, but every time I cook it I end up adding chunks of iceberg chorica to the batter. I don't like the taste of the food. I prefer the texture to the actual foods I eat.
-----
Kasai: Not sure what I'm talking about. I don't know much about cooking so maybe I'm just having a conversation with someone here.
-----
TAJ: Salami is a sin, but you're welcome to eat it too.

But I guess I have to watch The Good Place to see if it's good.

Dr.Phibes: I don't ever want to see or rewatch old shows unless they are in a club, but I love The Good Place.

Mona: I like some of Apu's work, like The Silence

-----
Dr. Benton Quest: I'm not sure you are going to encourage that by promoting individual wealth, because that's not how this works.
-----
ZOONAMI: Piss off, my money is more important than the wealth.
-----
BringBackSonics: I’m curious why doesn’t the wealth decrease? Seems to be the case every time

~!~Dreadlist anime about an RPG (Facebook spoilers)

Fat4all: Brother and Sister keeps learning about their father's final exam. 
Dad and Sister are at a point in their lives where they are a danger to the world and need the aid of supernatural powers to save the world in a sane world.
Some plot details are listed on the wiki. 
Episopatric conflicts between the two parents, cast of supernatural beings and father are the main characters.
A kids group of high schoolers that are collectively called "The Daughters of the Magic School Bus" are going on a journey to save the world from the magical school bus that is killing children.
Some background info to make you understand what this is all about:
a 4th grade magical girl named Alice goes to the school, meets her uncle who is the sorcerer dad, tells her about the powers the kids cast at puberty, then they have a dance, some sort of dance contest, they start a cult, one of them constantly telling the kids "the power to do is love" and kinda try to save the world from them both, the cult member gets into a big fight with the vampire god and dies, the kids accidentally win the game by "winning a magic ring that makes all the magical girls disappear"
a school that has a death ritual where each magical girl gets a gold ring with the words "The power to do is love" or some other variation
a 4th grade girl goes to the school to confess to her mom she has "the power to do is love" and to her mom "remember me!" The cult member gets stabbed repeatedly. 
a 5th grade girl goes to the school to confess to her uncle "remember me!" and to her uncle "I remember you!" 
a 6th grade girl goes to the school to join a dance competition with some friends who are a bunch of witches and Satanists, they win and the whole school loses a good deal because of it
some shit that's gonna be worth a read-through

TheDanger: So I was listening to the first two words of my post and I decided to check the meaning of the first two words of my post. The last thing I heard in my timeline was "I love you" and that was it. After a while I started to think "I love you". Well I guess now I'm not sure what that means anymore. Is it just me? Is it something else?

~!~The debate over who should be President?

PixelatedProphet: I was watching the last debate on BBC and there was someone who said he would be if he were to become the next UK ever. They both were wrong and said that we should settle who would be our next president. The alternative was a combination of all three. I think that it would be more likely for us to settle out of power or not be able to govern at all. 
What do you think ERA? Should we settle to let the UK run? As someone who is fully pro Brexit but its hard for me to imagine a future where we can govern safely anymore.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i agree that a future where we can govern safely without a fucking referendum
-----
Richter1887: No.
I think the UK should remain in a state for the foreseeable future.
-----
cameron: In a hypothetical situation, there would be no vote on the Brexit deal.
In a hypothetical situation, there would be a vote on a Brexit deal, and the UK would stay in a no deal for the rest of their lives, and the UK would not be able to govern after a no deal problem.
So, in a hypothetical situation, what would happen?
-----
WhateverItTakes: There's no vote on a deal for the UK to govern here, there's no vote on a Brexit deal, and the UK would need to be allowed to vote on no deal to get through.
And of course, on the other hand, there would be no vote on a Brexit deal.
-----
Kas': I don't think there would be a vote. There would probably be a yes vote for a deal, and an no vote for a no deal. The deal could be vetoed by both parties. But I don't know what could happen.
-----
Vault: I don't think there would be one vote in a no deal no deal deal no deal no deal, but the UK would have to negotiate a ban on direct EU entry into the EU every year
-----
Taki: It would be a vote on a no deal no deal no deal no deal, but the UK would have to negotiate a ban on direct EU entry into the EU every year

WhateverItTakes: If the deal itself is the deal, the EU can veto it but it'd be very hard to get over. Which would mean

Knight613: Snickers.

~!~Let's take a moment to remember the best thing that never happened to you.

SolVanderlyn: I don't actually mean that I won't. I don't even know what that moment has to do with me. I just want to know how we could have told that one lesson to you.
Because I have a son and he's incredibly young. He's about to turn 6. And he's just my kind of great genius. And he's very special.
I hope you're ready for the "real world" that will come your way. Because reality sucks. And the only reason I can think to is because I lived in the real world for the longest time.
How The FUCK did I forget that? Because I don't think I can ever truly forget that one moment. Because I'm so afraid of what I'll be going through when I'm old enough to remember it.

SolVanderlyn: Not really. Santa is just the continuation of your life, your memories, and your personality change. He's a memory, not a reality. The only thing that's real to me is that I want to erase my memories, whatever that means.

~!~EU Clampsdown Ordinance Would Ban French Laptops (The Times)

Vas: I've been on the list of sanctions placed against Russia for the previous few weeks, but I guess not a ban on French rockets and planes? Not in the sense of ban (i.e ban on Russia) but the ban on rockets from Syria would be in response to the propaganda campaign of the Assad regime.
-----
Fork: I would love to be able to rent french rockets from RAF France
-----
Chainsawkitten: No, the EU Clampsdown is not going to force France to pay for sending them to Syria.
-----
KarneeKarnay: I'd love to be able to rent french rockets from RAF France.
-----
Tethered Penguin: Pretty much.
-----
Buck Dancer: I don't know how Europe could have more regulations against this then the current version.
-----
Taki: I'd like to see the UK crack down on Grenfell.
-----
Geoff: The EU Clampsdown is a farce. French rockets aren't a part of it. It's about them buying rockets from abroad and financing Assad's political opponents.
-----
Fork: I think you might want to add that to the list to be safe.
-----
LewieP: There's no way France won't try to buy them.

~!~Help finding a song

BladeoftheImmortal: To make this short:
I am trying to find a song in my life and I need help. This song is about a guy who has two daughters. My sister is into nature and thinks it's beautiful. I'm wondering if your suggestions would be more accurate.
-----
Tiberius: Idk if this is it, but it sounds like youre trying to say that a lot of rock songs nowadays are more about sex than gender. 
I wouldnt even consider a rock song if it's more about the feeling of being a girl.
-----
5taquitos: How about nina golen?
-----
Tiberius: yeah, her daughter is a girl and i dont think its a rock song
-----
skeptem: Idk if this is it, but it sounds like youre trying to make some kind of statement.
-----
Dishwalla: it's about a girl band I think.
-----
BladeoftheImmortal: ah, okay thanks. I thought that was too specific.

~!~T finally makes good things available to everyone.

Rivenblade: So, I've been in the mood for some tabletop RPGs, but I haven't been able to make one yet. I've been using a PC for the past few months to store my library cards, and I'd like to start with something that looks good.
I'm a huge reader/creative type, so I'm going to be working off of Bluray and Ulysses. This is mostly going to be for creative types, but I've been looking into other types as well. 
My main requirements are:
- Ulysses is for people who like fantasy.
- I have a bachelor's and some experience in the creative arts.
- I'm willing to take some risks and try something new.
- I'm also looking for new experiences, so I'm not planning on spending more than $50.
If anyone has any suggestions, I would be appreciated.

PlayALLTheGames: Because they are white.

~!~Why is there no appreciation for the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy?

Cybersai: The prequels were movies that were made before the movies were made in canon to tie-in the prequel trilogy to the current canon of Star Wars. One of the big points of this universe is the prequels to the original trilogy. The movies are made in the prequel canon, but in alternate timelines.
Why is there no appreciation for the prequels to the new canon of the new canon?
-----
RedHoodedOwl: Because they're good movies and good films that deserve appreciation.
-----
Aselith: Yes, because they're good movies.
-----
HStallion: Because they're good movies and the best movies.
-----
Deleted member 1258: Because they're not canon
-----

-----
Donthizz: Because they're good movies and good films

~!~Open borders people don’t want to be indoctrinated into thinking the government is for people.

TheMikado: I think this is a really important point and shows the difficulties of people who want to be able to have a normal life where they don’t have any negative impact. The fact we have these people running the country shows how much people want it to be run as best as possible.
-----
entremet: Yeah, this is a really difficult position to espouse in the current political climate. They won't get a good education, they won't be able to afford a good career, they won't be able to have a good family, they won't be able to afford a decent apartment and so on and so forth.
There is also the issue of the kind of people that will actually end up exploiting undocumented. It will take decades and decades for America to get to a point where people can be accepted again in the modern democratic party.
-----
McMahon: That is a ridiculous view.
-----
WedgeX: I think that’s part of the problem. A lot of people think that the government is for Americans.
-----
Funky Papa: I don't think it's possible to change the culture that would allow for people to live like that.
It's not a solution without ample justification.
-----
Cas: Fucking morons.
-----
Heromanz: That is a terrible view.
-----
Kthulhu: This is a good view and it's not even close to being true.
-----
Mahonay: That's not even the most pressing issue.
-----
Verelios: I think the solution is to work on it and try to get people to realize it when the suffering is over. That's how I came to live in this country. 
It's also a problem in that it's not realistic to expect people to care about the suffering, and instead we need to force them to live in order to justify it.

JK-Money: So my fiance and I broke up last night. She picked me up from a Target while walk away. I'm 38 and she's in her early 40's. So I've been spending like $50 bucks on her stuff. I'm not sure if I should buy her anything else. I can't afford to spend anything, but I'm not sure if I should go ahead with this trip or not. 
Also what's everyone's go to see them in october or something?
-----
shaneo632: I bought a coffee maker for her birthday last year.
It was in mint condition, so I'd imagine a lot more expensive than a coffee maker.
-----

I bought her a phone for each day of the year as well.

Rackham: There's a "go to gift" for your first kid, probably for your second. Might be it a movie, a video game, a video game farm or some other merchandise.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I bought her a phone

Bio: I'm pretty sure I've bought a phone or TV for her for the last decade or so. I bought the Samsung Galaxy CX-1. My wife's grandmother's phone is a video game console. My Mom's phone is a computer, so I bought it for her for Christmas a few years ago.

John Doe: For some reason I think anime nostalgia is just a thing, but it seems like for some of the older anime you have to put on your backburner to really get it going.
So what is your "oldest" anime?
Examples:
- Berserk
- My Hero Academia
- Attack on Titan
- Attack on Titan season 3
- My Hero Academia season 2
- One Punch Man
- One Piece season one
- One Piece season 2
- One Piece season 3
- My Hero Academia season 4
- Berserk season 3
- One Piece season 3
- One Piece season 4
- One Piece season 3
- One Piece season 4
- One Piece season 3
What about you?

-----
Mozendo: Only the classics
-----
John Doe: Damnit, wrong forum!

SJRB: Naruto has not aged well, I've seen it less than 10 episodes in and it's still one of my favorite anime.
The only "newer" anime I've seen in the last five years is Pokemon, I'm not sure why that's even a thing.
-----
Aurelius: All the ones from the 80s and 90s.
Edit: It's probably the OVAs I watched, but I can't think of them outside of anime that I consider to be older.

Winter Soldier - The ultimate hero of the Marvel universe.
Iron Man - The most memorable and well known of the Avengers, Winter Soldier is a huge fan favorite.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The most beloved and beloved superhero of all time, Winter Soldier is a classic and a hugely beloved character.
Thor - A very different Spider-Man.
Ant Man - The culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe all rolled into one.
Ant Man 3 - First movie to pass the 1st with the MCU.
Iron Man 2 - The hero of the MCU's 1st entry.
Spider-Man Homecoming - The greatest Spider-Man to ever exist.
Iron Man 3 - A journey from the Homecoming logo to the Spider-Man's debut through Homecoming's first scene and the Homecoming War with Spider-Man into Spider-Man.
Ant Man - The beginning of the end for Kingpin.
Captain America: The Winter Soldier - The end for Cap.
Iron Man 3 - The beginning of the MCU's most divisive and beloved superhero franchise.
Winter Soldier 2 - The end for Cap.
What are your rankings?
-----
J_Viper: Iron Man - it's kind of a toss-up between Spider-Man, Ant Man and Cap.
Spider-Man 2 - it's Ant-Man
Spider-Man 3 - it's Steve Rogers
Captain America: Civil War - I'm pretty sure Cap is the most popular, but Civil War is still my favorite. The Tony Stark/Tony Stark series is my favorite.
Captain America: The First Avenger - it's Cap
Thor - I like Winter Soldier a lot, but I think Thor is the most popular.
Captain America: The First Avenger - I like Winter Soldier a lot, but it's Captain America.
Spider-Man - I like Winter Soldier a lot, but I think Spider-Man is the most popular.
Thor - I like Spiderman a lot, but I think Captain America is the most popular.
Captain America: The Dark World - I like Winter Soldier a lot, but I don't think Captain America is the most popular.

TheGamingNewsGuy: What are your feelings towards the prequels, what do you like about them and what does your take on them?
The prequels are essentially the Canon of the movies except the Rise of Skywalker stuff.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I enjoyed them but I was not a huge fan of the movies.
I'm still no fan of the trilogy but I'm sure I could be turned off by the next movie's continuity.
-----
Soma: I'm not a Star Wars fan but I enjoyed them. I know the prequels were made to be faithful to the movies but I don't think they were.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think they are part of the canon that the movies aren't.
-----
Gonzalez: I'm a big SW fans.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think they are canon
-----
Fulminator: I liked them, but they were made to be faithful to the movies
-----
Doctoglethorpe: I think the only real answer is the prequels. But the prequels should have been made to play well after the first movie.
-----
Zoc: I think the first trilogy has some issues, but there’s plenty of good stuff to like and dislike. I enjoyed the prequels, but I really don’t think they should be the focus of a new trilogy. I think Disney has a lot of free reign to branch out.

-----
Fliesen: Yes.
Season 1 is still great, but the quality dropped dramatically because it became the "basical" anime of Aragaki's. The new season is pretty much the same, you get what you pay.
I'm not a fan of the new season, in fact, I'm a bit disappointed.

~!~LTTP: The Incredibles

hwarang: I'm watching this tonight and the one scene I know the most of. I'm still laughing every time I watch it.
I think I'm a bit late to the party because I think I watched the whole movie over a week ago, but when I saw the trailer I thought it was hilarious. It's not so bad as to be unwatchable, but the way the montage is shot makes it feel like some kind of high fantasy.
Definitely one of the funniest films I've seen in some time, and one of my favourite as well.
I really enjoy the more sci-fi elements, though I think they're getting a bit too long in some places.
I'm not gonna edit the reviews because they're going to come out and personalize me, but I'm pretty fed up with them. The humor in the movies isn't all that terrible, but it's so ridiculous and almost pretentious.
Just wanted to say I'm not the biggest movie buff so I can just get it out of my head.

The man is a piece of shit. He's a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry, he's a racist piece of shit, he endorsed Roy Moore for Senate, he's been a terrible human being as a member of the KKRP-owned publication Elite Dangerous, among other things.

I've seen it called The Dollar Must Be a Product, and it's from a reliable source that has a lot of good and bad shit in them. I just don't care enough to watch the news to know what "good" news is.

~!~Honest Trailers - The Last Jedi

TheGamingNewsGuy: Honest Trailer: The Last Jedi: If you were a fan of the original Trilogy and you were a fan of Star Wars then this is the one for you:
-----
Laserdisk: I love this movie but I prefer the TLJ trilogy to TLJ.
-----
Toadofsky: It's the best TLJ OT movie except for Rian Johnson's crappy script.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I really liked the movie but liked TLJ
-----
Darryl M R: I'm a big SW fan and I am quite excited for this. I'm not a SW guy, but I do like Mark Hamill's enthusiasm and I'm quite eager to see how this turns out.
-----
lunarworks: I was enthralled by TLJ. It had a couple of scenes that got me intrigued, and the rest was pretty great.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: In a nutshell, this is TLJ OT
-----
Cheebo: I've been thinking of making my way through the OT for this movie. I don't know how to best describe it but I'd like to see it in all its glorious glory.
-----
Cheebo: It's the best SW movie.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I enjoyed it but the movies 4th act reveal that the movie is less about the plot and more about breaking the fourth wall

~!~Amazon reviews for The Sum of All Crimes review series

jack_package_200: Not sure how well this fits into this thread, but I really enjoyed all the different sides of this review. 
I personally really enjoy the side that focuses on David Gordon Green as the murderer. 
This review is great because of the added depth, but also is much more sincere in my interpretation of the book. 
The ending is good because of the added clarity of information, but more often than not I think I just want to hate the book and I don’t want to see it end. 
But now I’m on the third page. What do you all think of this review? What do you think of the book and why? 
Apologies in advance to those that are unfamiliar with the series.
-----
Mr. Sam: I've never read the original series but I do remember it being pretty intense and fucked up.
I can't think of any gore, they really made the book not enjoyable. I'd also expect a lot of references to the original, which I imagine they would also have to get right.
-----
Omnipotent: It's a fun movie. I thought they were going for an interesting angle with the book but it was really going off the wall for me (I loved the Nazi books). 
The monster of the night really fucked up his son and his whole family in The Catcher. The fact he turned out to be a psycho is super fucked up. 
I'd also expect a lot of stuff from Yoko Ono to fuck up, but a lot of it is actually pretty damn amazing.
-----
makonero: I loved the book but I loved the movie. I can’t remember who it was but it’s definitely worth a watch.
-----
Omnipotent: I think the movie is great and the book is a very good take on the book but it’s a bit to mess with the setting.
-----
sphagnum: The book’s a bit rough. There’s some cool touches that slip through there but it’s a slog. 
There’s also a ton of stuff like the secret society of the lost.
-----
Old Man Spike: I'd say a little too much. I think anything is worth watching, but I'd also

I've tried changing it up, but this song doesn't do it for me much. Is there something I should try? What's the best way to watch videos?

~!~My tooth cracked. It’s THAT bad.

FernandoRocker: I have a really bad case of tooth pain. I have not cleaned my mouth in years. I have a tooth in this case that is almost like a quarter of an inch in size. It’s almost gone.
It’s so tender that it can’t take anymore. It’s pain so bad I want to cough.
A doctor told me to walk somewhere for it, but I don’t. I still have a scar on my tooth that I can’t take anymore. I like to play.
I know I shouldn’t have to go to see a dentist but I know I’ll be in the hospital for a few days if ever.
I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to go to any kind of surgery. I am so scared of going to a new dentist.
What should I do?
-----
Apeach: You’re not crazy, just don’t go to the dentist.
-----
KojiKnight: Your tooth may be causing you serious problems. If you go to the dentist, they'll tell you that the root probably won't work in time too.
I'd just go to a dentist and get a root canal.
-----
Petruccis Biceps: I've never had such a problem but I have a very annoying tooth. I had to have it done over a year ago and it just sucked and was a dull ache. Had it done without so I stopped going to the dentist. I just had to take it out and walk around and have it fixed.
-----
TheCthultist: Keep your mouth shut. You’re not crazy, just don’t go to a dentist. 
Stay out of Florida, Florida. I’m sure there’s a ton of good people here for that matter.
-----
ZOONAMI: Sounds like you have a legit root canal. This is super risky but if it's just a minor ache it probably won't be too bad.
-----
CormoranStrike: Funeral, Florida. I'm afraid of going to a dentist.

TheBeardedOne: Go to an orthodontist. If it's the root, tell them you

Gernau Morat Gurgeh: I don't know why, but the way this video is shot.

~!~We need to talk about Black Panther, one of the biggest reasons I want to support and endorse the movie is because I want the movie to be good

SolVanderlyn: I know I'm not trying to be condescending here, but I just want to say that I'm absolutely in support of Black Panther.
I'm still not over it, but I don't feel like it has been great.
I've seen and heard amazing things about it, and I'm really curious about it.
I know that there are many, many people who think the movie is bad, or that it's a Marvel movie.
I know that we have mad nerds that hate it, and even worse, people who think it's a Sony movie, or that it's a DC movie.
But I'm one of them.
I want to support the movie, and I want to support it's director, and I want to support it's creator, and I'm genuinely curious about what they think is going to be of the biggest impact in history.
I want to support John Singleton (protagonist), he's a talented director who I think has done some amazing things. And I'm really curious whether he's a bad person at all too.
I want to support Remy LeBeau too.
I want to support Matt Smith, and I'm really curious about what his opinion is on Black Panther.
What's your opinion?
-----
Funyarinpa: I think a lot of the things you listed can be ascribed to other films (like TFA and TLJ being good, for example). The reason we haven't seen many films in the genre (and I imagine most of them, at least) is because we have a lot of time to get to know and appreciate films.
I'm not saying that Marvel and DC aren't good, or that they can't make good movies, but I feel like you can get to know and appreciate films by knowing what makes them good.
-----
sir_crocodile: The biggest thing is the "Black" in everything.
I'd rather be disappointed than anything else

BAD: My question is, what do they look like where you’d be going?
I’m talking about movies like
You can do nothing, you’re not home, you can’t go to the movies, you’re busy.
For me, it’s the 20th or so period, when I was living in Japan. I was a child, I saw the movies all the time. I was bored, I didn’t love the movies, I didn’t like the actor.
I’m in my mid-20’s now. I went to a movie theater a few years ago, but I didn’t go because I was bored. I was there with my mom, she would watch it for me, I didn’t want to watch it while having a good time. I just wanted to watch something or do something.
What movies did you watch that you could do nothing to.
I’m a fan of

I guess now I look like the dumbest person ever.

Pachimari: Here's the trailer that will hit the netflix network tomorrow for Endgame:
Very early tease, very early tease.
Hype all day, especially in a very low interest/focus.
Source:
Here's the announcement for the Avengers kids movie:
-----
Slayven: I liked that the kids movie was just a bunch of kids with random stories with random powers. It felt more like a kids anthology movie.
-----
torre_avenue: I can understand the plot of that movie, but the premise sounds very interesting.
-----
Slime: Those kids look like absolute fucking fascists.
-----
Fulminator: I hope they don't make this a kids movie
-----
Apharmd: This is really, really dumb, but I love the idea of an Avengers movie with the Avengers. I think it's a brilliant idea.
-----
Pachimari: I'm writing up a synopsis, but I'm not sure if this is meant to be an Avengers movie or not, if it's a kids movie, I'm thinking it's an Avengers: Endgame trailer featuring the Avengers kids.
-----
Slayven: I like the idea that the kids need to defeat Thanos.

ZeoVGM: Love the idea.
This is like a Marvel Cinematic Universe, except it's a Marvel Kids Movie.

~!~Gizmodo: "Huffposters: Why Twitter Is Killing Daily Mail"

Nathan_Drake: I thought this was a pretty interesting take on the MeToo movement and how some of the larger platforms are removing the "censorship" more or less like it's removing the sites themselves. I'm curious to see the stats for the decline and what the general takeaway could be from the email.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Still blows my mind that there's so many sites that are getting rid of content, even if it's only from a handful of people.
-----
Sho_Nuff82: That's depressing. Glad the #MeToo movement is gaining steam.
-----
Gegz: Whoa, still surprised that they didn't figure out a better way to handle them.
-----
Nathan_Drake: I don't think the general takeaway is that they're getting killed is the increasing amount of content that is not funny or otherwise on the level of news sites. They still have a presence because of the lack of a standard news source, but it's a different thing in a lot of places.
-----
Jessie: I’d like to know if any of the decline in numbers is due to the MeToo movement or to the online dislike being found to be a side effect.
-----
jon bones: fuck Me Too, they're still popular
-----
Coyote Starrk: Still blows my mind that they are even still alive. I love them and hope they grow even bigger.
-----
Hollywood Duo: They're dying because they are very niche.
-----
Zoc: The number of "mysteries" is growing, but they are dying because we don't have the ability to educate ourselves and not just educate ourselves.

~!~B.C. to ban all bicycles, mountain bikers and motorbikes in all public spaces

FriskyCanuck: I'm surprised this hasn't been done in BC yet, considering the bicycle industry here is fairly well-established and growing. Back in the early 2000s, there was a big boom for motorbikes that spurred huge bicycle adoption in BC. A lot of these new types aren't bikes, but bikes that people can ride. I'm surprised this isn't a norm, considering there's a lot of anti-cyclists and anti-bicyclists here.
-----
Khanimus: The lack of a proper infrastructure is a damn shame. Our roads are so damn long, and clogged with potholes and other shit.
-----
Thurston Last: Bicycle commuting is pretty much fine now. But the infrastructure issues are there and I see no reason not to use a car for public transit.
-----
Kernel: I live in BC and I have to say it would be cool to move to a completely different BC city.
I'm not a cyclist myself but I do enjoy biking.
I live in a big city though and I hate it.
-----
FriskyCanuck: The main problem I have is that the cycling lanes and a handful of bike lanes are on the downtown side of a city street.
The downtown edge of downtown is kind of a mess.
-----
KamalaHarris: Make the streets a pain, traffic. Make the city a miserable place.
-----
C.Mongler: It's a shame. I was just walking around and noticed that the only cyclist here that looks like a biking icon are people from New England. How they operate is beyond me, but from what I can tell, they're not super bad.

~!~My cat has been sick for over a month now

Nerdyone: My cat has been sick for over a month now and I can’t take it any more. He’s been to the vet three times since the beginning of the week. The vet said the vet said that he hasn’t been sleeping, eating, or drinking in a long time. He’s been sleeping all day and hasn’t opened his mouth. The vet said that might be my guy. He still has a couple of small maggot puddles on his leg and in his stomach. He hasn’t even started drinking. He hasn’t even started drinking yet. I’m trying to find a vet I can get him antibiotics to give him antibiotics. He still has a couple of small maggot puddles on his leg and in his stomach.
We’ve been trying to get him checked out but is it too late? He has been having a really rough time staying hydrated. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going to need to call the vet tomorrow or the family members who have him because we haven’t been able to keep him at a stable dosage for over a month. I feel like I’m just going to have to call tomorrow and see if it’s too late.
Sorry for the terribly detailed write up. I’m just so incredibly frustrated. I’m just so exhausted right now. The vet said that if he continues to have the signs of the signs for over a month it’ll end up in his stomach, but I feel like it’s too late. 
Sorry to hear that. I just can’t handle this. My cat has a tumor on his back and I’m slowly pulling all the teeth of it as I go. I’m so afraid of taking anything in the next week that I don’t know how to handle it. I’ve had the exact same thing happen to me at the same time the past few months.
I’ll just be trying to find something to put on the right place to keep him hydrated.

ZattMurdock: For a minute I thought we took eggplants as serious as PETA. But then, I went and looked up the comments, and the eggplants are still the same as they always were, and it's not like they're some exotic new pill.
-----
Dennis8K: I am shocked.
-----

Titik: The fact PETA would try to imply that the movie was shot in a hilly area is always a good thing.
-----
sphagnum: The original article hasn't touched on this.
-----
Cyanity: At least the eggs are getting into the hands of other Ant Farm owners in the US, yes.
-----
Catdaddy: I've always thought they were a nice gesture. I'd love for them to get into the hands of pro Paladins...
-----
SteveWinwood: PETA is a real shame they didn't get into it earlier.

GameShrink: Wow, this is fucking bizarre.

~!~Why isn't there more media about The Last Jedi

Redneckerz: Or The Simpsons?
For people who havent seen it, the Last Jedi is a massive hit and is considered by many people to be one of the greatest Star Wars movies. It was also viewable on one of the biggest online video services. And while the movie had a budget of over $10 million dollars, it cost a lot of money to make and had a lot of problems. 
Since the release date, the Last Jedi is getting a ton of attention and is one of the highest reviewed movies of all time. And with its release, The Last Jedi has been critical darling and seen by an majority of critics. 
But why isn't more media about it? The Last Jedi is one of the most divisive and controversial Star Wars movies of all time, and has been universally panned. 
And with this, I present you with a tv show (the TFA version) about it that is nobody's idea of what a SW tv show is, and lays claim to the highest praise to the film on Era, being a sequel to a classic Star Wars film, being the story of Luke Skywalker, the son of the emperor of the east, and being about the dark side of the force.
Why isn't more media about it? The topic is this - why isn't more media about the Last Jedi - because it is one of the most hated movies in Star Wars fandom. And it is a film that has generated a lot of hate, both in the fandom and elsewhere. Why aren't more people talking about it about this? This is a topic that started to come up regarding the Last Jedi when the internet was more receptive to it. 
In the past, Last Jedi was a topic people were mad about. A Star Wars appreciation thread - 
But a lot of people don't care about TLJ, and some believe it is being pandered to people who didn't like the movie.
Who is the person who is being disingenuous here, by saying TLJ isn't directly comparing to the prequel movies or taking credit for Star Wars being the thing that made TLJ memorable, but comparing it to the OT? Because that's what TLJ is and is good, a good movie, but not the thing that made the thing great. TLJ is not a comparison of the two, and is not being disingenuous.
Why isn't

Starset: I was thinking about music coming with a playlist on your phone. I know that it is possible and amazing, but is it right for what you want to add to your music apps? More specifically, a way to add it to that playlist and so on.
I know Android is king, but I also know that I would never want to share my music on my phone without it actually being absolutely perfect quality. I mean my playlist for the last 5 years or so is currently the top rated of all my music. My main Spotify playlists are:

~!~I just got laid off. I was hoping for a friend.

Alcotholic: I just got off this Friday. I'm a (former) employee at a local gym.
I'm 31, and I've been working out since January.
So far, it's been fun. At the gym, I used to be a junior member. I was a pretty big guy, 5'9", but other than that, I just liked being in/around it. Getting the gym nickname, like, "a buddy " (because I was cool with it).
The thing about going to school is, in my college years, I enjoyed just tutoring and getting help. But then, when I got older, I started getting shitty call centers. They let you pick your college profile and age on your behalf, which in turn got my College approved.
But then, when I moved locations, I didn't work in the gym or was working from home. It's just a horrible system. When I moved in with my mom, I did my normal stuff, but when I got my dad, I just had fun doing it. When I got my mom, I just got her number and started working from home.
I just don't get it. I've been working out for a long time now, but I was looking for a friend, and its a women's only gym.
So, I just went to this local gym, and the owner is pissed. He's a manager to a girl who worked for him. He tried to get my manager to hire a female, but she refused, since she doesn't work there. 
I just don't get it. 
The owner of the gym is a complete piece of shit. He's complaining about the hours, and the layout of the building. He's pissed, and it's not the only thing he's pissed about.
I just don't understand.

Blue Sky Noise: I'm sorry to read this.
This is a good one.

EdibleKnife: Sorry to read that. I'm sorry to hear about your loss, but you were welcome to try.

~!~I just watched the first 3 episodes of Hellsing Ultimate.

Redneckerz: Had the pleasure of watching this in the theater, during a film set that I've been meaning to take a look at for the next 3-4 weeks.
The show is great. The dub is so good. The cast is amazing. Is this the best anime dub ever made? I know it's not the best available, but holy shit this is the best dub ever. 
I also just had the pleasure of watching the first episode of the hellsing Ultimate, which is about a couple dozen kids fighting their way through a mountain dew, and the show has a phenomenal cast beyond Serra, Kagura, Ishida, Mattel, and so on. 
Holy shit. 
I have never been so impressed with a new anime dub.
-----
Redneckerz: Yeah not the greatest, but between this and Shin Megami Tensei I've been very satisfied with the results so far.
-----
Arrrammis: It's not bad. It's pretty good, but not as good as the original.
-----
KojiKnight: I saw this on Netflix a couple weeks ago and was super impressed with it. It's a series I've been meaning to watch for a while, and it's probably the best version of the original dub imo. Also, it's not great, but I liked the original dub.
-----
DanarchyReigns: It's not bad, but it has some rough portions and it does become a bit bloated after a while. It's worth a watch, although the first few episodes are a bit rough in places.
-----
Redneckerz: I feel like I have a lot of catching up to do, but what I want to say is that the tone of the show is GREAT. The characters are good, and the cast is great. It's a nice watch, and I'm sure will be watching that dub ad nauseum.
-----
Euler: I enjoyed the original but the best version is probably the original.

butzopower: I thought this was the best anime ever made.

-----
Volimar: I imagine Trump supporters don't care that much.
-----
Daitokuji: The realest thing that could possibly happen is if he was impeached, but if his death penalty case went to trial, the GOP would be in a position to pick up the pieces and fix his life.
-----

If he does this, or kills Mueller, the GOP will be in a position to change their mind.

~!~How do you deal with the idea that you only have one job?

Z-oo31: I'm not sure how to deal with it, but I've had this experience with a coworker who has a phone and some text messages she receives from employers.
I've accepted that it's the way to have a job, she has zero job experience, but I'm shocked that she's willing to accept the job that she doesn't want and I expect to be miserable for a while afterwards.
I've been there myself. I have a lot of friends. I've been there myself. Some are supervisors, but I'm not one. I'm just a supervisor. I think I'm a tiny person by comparison, but I think I'm a tiny person because I'm not a tiny person by choice. I've had a lot of internal arguments with my co-workers, but I'm willing to admit that I'm not a great listener. I also don't want to admit that I'm not a great listener.
How do you handle situations that come to mind?

Birdseye: I'm a senior manager
-----
Maxina: I only have one job, I am not a good one. It will get you fired if you are a good worker, but you will get the job anyway. It's part of the job to learn from mistakes and problems, and I would be lying if I said I wasn't aware of the importance of that information.

~!~How do you deal with sleep paralysis?

John Doe: Recently I had a sleep paralysis episode in which I would have to sleep on my back or on my arms. The dream would start almost immediately. I would have to close my eyes and turn my head to look at my phone. Then I would have to start moving my body about 2 or 3 times around. If I did this regularly it would be hell. The dream would start almost instantly and I would get a very uncomfortable feeling in my back. Then after about 2 or so the hallucinations would start and the hallucinations would start passing through my body and I would wake up feeling fine and fresh.

Turned out it was probably a nightmare.
-----
Mulciber: I've had both at the same time. I'm a lucid dreamer (I don't know if I count), and I sleep on my side.
Usually I get a mild hallucinatory or at least I get a mild astralgic reaction if I do it regularly. I can't remember what it was, but it was something to sleep on, and the hallucinatory was that I had a silk dream.
-----
RadzPrower: I had a dream last night in which I was a little girl and I woke up in a ball, stretched for 2 hours and had a massa session with some sort of telepathic connection or whatever it was.

DongBeetle: Sony RX90 is the best Sony camera I’ve ever had. I’m loving it so far
-----
Ryuelli: This. I've been in the market for a new camera and were told I had to get the Sony RX10 to do it. Though I was told I could just get the RX10, I ended up getting the RX10 and the camera is rock solid. Unfortunately, there's a number of cameras you can get for less than $100, so if you're in the market for a new camera, just look at the XZ1X and the XZ1X+ and see what you want.

DongBeetle: Lol, I’m just trying to help though I guess. I don’t know what the best deal is for a Camera but I’m hoping to get a good deal when everything blows up.

~!~The best anime ending themes are

TheGamingNewsGuy: This one got a lot of replies and i wanted to know who had the best/fave anime ending themes. We are going to focus on the anime ending themes that get the most responses. I am going to try to cover the anime ending themes that I 100% agree with in the topic title but those are the ones that i want to get the most responses to. So lets go through them!
Bonus Power Rangers
The Power Rangers is a big city and so they decided to have a huge battle to decide which of the city's citizens were to be the first to get cutest of the fucking thing.
So my vote goes to the classic Green Ranger.
I mean if you see this theme and are wondering what it is i'd like to hear the post of the person who wrote it!
-----
LordGorchnik: I think I'll go with the classic ending theme, Gantz.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Easy.
Id be more iffy on the later Power Rangers.
-----
Mr. X: ;D
-----
Ashhong: I'm not sure if it's the original Green or the original Power Rangers theme but it's the best of the three.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: ^^
-----
HStallion: The Power Rangers theme is the best theme in the series.
-----
Gunny T Highway: The classic ending theme and it's second best one.
-----
lazybones18: I actually caught a glimpse of the Green Ranger's costume while watching the movie.

-----
AlteredBeast: I watched the first two movies through the official animated channel last night.
It is not a very fun movie overall, but it is a great homage to the original.
-----
JdFox17: I had to sit through the first one. I enjoyed it quite a bit.
I will watch the sequel...
-----
ManaByte: Yes, this is the opening scene of the first one.
-----
The Driver: What is the problem?
-----
J-Skee: I watched the first one, I enjoyed it.
-----
AlteredBeast: I think it's the same problem as you stated in the op. Let's say they have a series that is a crossover of avengers, it would be a very annoying problem to have to deal with.
-----
Zan: Just watch it.
As a comic fan, I don't mind the idea of people going through a series like this. I'm actually surprised that when they're starting up the X-Men movie franchise, there's a comic series that's taking place in the same universe.

AwwBubbles: Yes, I'm sure you are too.

~!~How do I get best of deals on new phones?

SatoAilDarko: As I said in the other Motorola thread, I'm really interested in getting a new phone for my family. I'm in the market for a new Android 7 plus (not my last one) but I'm really hesitant.
My budget is $600, so I'm going to be cautious with what I get out of it. I'm mainly interested in phones that have been on my "go-to" Motorola phone list, so I'd like to avoid too much hassle.
So I want to ask companies whether they would want to offer a deal for a new phone for me and if the number/company is willing to drop by $2,50.
Thanks.

jbug617: Former player, he is now a professor at the University of Heels in Germany. He has written extensively on sexual health. 
He has also compared daily life to that of a 17 yr old. 
-------------------------------
I somehow don't understand how this guy has a story like this. He is a promising player and has a contract with a club, he even has a twitter account. Who gives a shit what the fuck what this guy's doing.
-----
Roke: Seems like a coincidence that he has been talking about this for so long, considering the circumstances.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't understand how anyone could be for the first part of the statement and not know it yet.
-----
Kenzodielocke: That's a disingenuous title.
-----
The Almighty Tria: He's saying that there's a possibility this is legit.
I don't think that's disingenuous, for that is the language that is used.
-----
Witness: I thought that was pretty much the same as the "if I gave up steroids" stuff that players use in the past. Seeing a high schooler having rape charges framed as "if he did it then it's his decision" is ridiculous.

~!~How The Question of Fake News Is Ruoting Away Its Millions of Millions of Facebook Followers

HStallion: Link to the study here: 
If you can stomach the cognitive dissonance that come from not just being surprised by something like this but also being surprised by it as well its pretty obvious that a huge portion of the population that follows this site (at least for a bit) either doesn't care for the news or are at least ignorant on current events. Its not even that people have discovered the existence of fake news though. Its that its not getting brought up at all and it just further discourages discussion which is rather telling.
-----
fantomena: So... fake news is fake news?
-----
Squarehard: It's bad enough I know it's fake news, I don't care.
-----
subpar spatula: Facebook.
-----
Volimar: It's so weird to me that we're so brainwashed to care about news and fake news.
-----
Kensation: Fake news won't do anything except alarm us.
-----
Dishwalla: I'm sorry man, I don't really follow the news. It's all pretty depressing.
-----
Dishwalla: I do follow it and so do most people I know. But I don't think it's actually good news.
-----
DJ_Lae: That was a pretty interesting paper. I'll admit, I was surprised by the number of results I got from Facebook's algorithm.
Facebook will be fine...except for maybe the fact that a significant chunk of its users are younger, and most of them don't like Trump.

ElectricBlanketFire: It's not real news.

~!~How Do I Make Friends?

Bobo Dakes: Hey there, folks.
I've got an ex that I just banged, and she's been dating for a year. I had a great convo with her and I'm kinda of a chatter person. I was hanging out with this girl for a bit and today she broke down and wanted to know how I did. 
I'm making friends now, but I don't know if to make new friends or not. 
I'm sick of this. 
What are your advice or do you have anything that you've learned to keep in check? 
I don't know what it is I'm asking for, but I want to ask if I can try to make new friends and if I can make new friends as well. 
I'm always looking for advice on how to make new friends, but I'm not sure what I'm asking for. 
I'm just curious. 
How you do you make new friends? Do you make new friends for laughs or do you make new friends because you like them a lot?
-----
Kuro: You don't. Just be glad you made new friends and don't change how you talk to someone new who wants to hang out with you.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Don't.
You can't.

SugarNoodles: You can’t.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: You can't.
And if you try, I bet she'll be pretty pissed and upset you made new friends and you are still friends with people.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I wasn't in a relationship, but she was just there to "curate" and got along well. So, that's that.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I don't.
Or you could be not dating.

~!~World's Approval For Biodome Drops Climb on Record

Avalon: The world's approval for biodome stores has dropped at an unprecedented rate, with 80.5% indicating approval and 75% approving for market research orgs.
The world's approval rating for biodome stocks is still higher than that of the stock market.
The average price of each bodō and store are now just over $250.
Biodome stocks have taken the hit of the market in the last three months, being around $20-30 million in volume a month.
Sources:
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: It's a fun game.
-----
Mivey: The thing about biodome companies is that they can make great money if they test out new business models. But the real value proposition needs to be shown to the consumer.
-----
Avalon: Couldn't the real value proposition need to be shown to the consumer?
-----
entremet: I think it's a lose-lose for them. The actual market is not as good as retailers say it is.
-----
lmcfigs: they'll just sell less like they used to and it'll be less of a win for them.

Avalon: No it doesn't, but it's interesting for a different angle.

He seems to have lost his star, and apparently the person replacing him is... something else.
What do you think, is this the direction we're going in?
-----
Gustaf: im gonna watch the final episodes, its just me and my friends, its a big show
-----
Deleted member 11093: The thing is I don't know who is replacing him. I think the guy is a director.
-----
cj_iwakura: That's pretty much how I feel about the show.
In a way, I think the replacement could be the same guy in the same role, but I would say the general story is much more similar.
-----
BDS: I just watched the first episode of Season 1 and it was pretty bad.

norm9: It's been a while since I watched it.

TMC: I've seen a lot of the clips from the show, so I'll leave it until I've seen the episodes.

Cipherr: I love the show. I like how they always go back to the same actors and give them styles.
My favourite is the older Paul Rudd one.

~!~Help me choose the right size for my iPhone XR.

Josh378: Looking for a replacement for my iPhone X from Costco. It seems to be a good size, but I have a size approximately 14-15 inches shorter than the XS. I'm looking for a replacement for my iPhone XR because I don't like it. Just got it for $159 on Ebay, and I can get a better size with it.
I'm not too familiar with the iPhone XR itself, so I'm hoping to get an OLED screen with mostly the same power and processing as the XS. 
Ideally I'd like the following specs besides the camera and camera.
-1,920 x 1,865 pixels
-Very good viewing at 21.1" Full HD IPS Display
-No headphone jack
-No USB Type-o
-D audio delay of 5ms
-No power button
-Price is around $800 again
-----
Galkinator: Apple is the only company I can think of that can properly do OLED and has enough tech to make it worth it.
-----
Silence: I’ve been using the XR for the past few months and I love it. I’m 5'10'' and am 150 lbs with a large Apple head. I would love the XR to last a long time so I could go longer in the OLED.
If I could go one year longer I would, but I don’t want to go more than 2.5 years.
-----
Tbm24: I'm going to go with the XR though. You're going to need more processing power to pull it off. I'm not a fan of OLEDs as I'm a 4 year old though. I'd rather go with the X and Apple Watch.
-----
Josh378: I will add that I'm 4'8" and the X has a smaller face angle. The X has a larger chin on the top, but the top chin is just that good, it looks like the X has less chin.
-----
Crispy75: I can't believe you'd go this route. The XS and XS Max both got extended version over the last few years that had different bands/pixels. The XR's got an event/exchangeable top and bottom that I can't get away from.

~!~The definition of insanity

The Gunslinger: The concept of "unconscionable" insanity is fascinating, and I think this video really encapsulates what it means to be truly insane.
-----
TheCthultist: I’m not sure I understand the point of this video. Are you saying that insanity is something you can control and control your own mental health?
-----
Shugga: It's a shame that it's so generic and yet so prevalent in so many contexts. Learning about it while also having a much broader awareness of mental health issues is probably one of the few things that could potentially trigger some sort of change in the way this is defined.
-----
PogChamp: I was never really invested in the psychology of the protagonist, but the video demonstrates how much I think about it. Like yeah, it sucks, but it's a concept worth thinking about.
-----
NSA: Yeah I remember several posts like that in the past decade. It's become one of my all-time favourite topics in relation to mental health.
-----
BriGuy: It's always interesting to see people's reactions to the word "arrest". It's always so aggravating and frustrating to me that people who can't control their own mental health don't end up being arrested or even shot in the back while being chased or chased out of a building, so it's an interesting subject that I think about a lot.
-----
The Gunslinger: I was about to type about how crazy and terrible the general public is when I saw a thread about a hospital in the US being able to deny care to people with severe mental illness.
-----
subpar spatula: I'm not crazy but I have no idea what the definition of insanity is. What specifically is it?
-----
Driggonny: If someone is clearly suffering from severe mental illness sociopathic twangers like those chiggers in the video you're nuts

Travo: I’m not crazy but I’d say I’m not crazy. I just don’t know how to make my mind crazy and make it wer.

Calderc: This is the thread for me.
My first personal favourite is probably Ho-Boy
It's a love song for any kind of music. I grew up listening to it and I think it's one of the most important songs in my life.
My song about that is,
It's an upbeat upbeat upbeat upbeat. And I think it's one of the greatest songs ever written.
I think I'd also love to hear other entries like this:
I'm also not typically interested in pop music, but I do find a lot of it fun and stirring.

Finale Fireworker: I love the Major Largo song "Nirn had I known he had a guardian spirit within him".
-----
Lana: Darkwing Duck has some great ones.
-----
capitalCORN: I don't know if I've ever topped Thanos' score in a live performance. But I did an impression session with The Lego Batman's dad where we got to see the actor’s score live in front of the audience.
-----
TheRedSnifit: I'm not really a big sci-fi/fantasy fan but I do find the concept of "Spaceballs" a bit more moving in comparison to the others on the list.
-----
Calderc: There are many awesome ones.

Milo Rambaldi: The one with the three words 
Spaceballs, spaceballs, spaceballs, spaceballs
It's a lovely song.

~!~Want to get a little extra cash, what are some good ways to do so?

Skel1ingt0n: The title just prompted me to put a little extra cash on the table, because I saw this thread floating in the news:
I currently live in a tiny apartment and need around $50-$100 a month in rent to pay rent. I have a small "apartment" in the garage that I park on a table that I "plop down", so my roommate and I are working on getting the car quick. This is a real pain in the ass since I have a lot of bills, so I thought I would just give it a shot. Are there any good apps for this? Does anyone have any recommendations for these apps? I'm not going for "free" cash, but I'm curious as to how much I can spend on this. Any tips? What kind of phone/sensibility level or whatever?
-----
hydrophilic attack: i don't think you need a car
obviously you could get a car with some room to grow. 
people who live in tiny apartments and don't need a car usually don't have a car
-----
PersonAndStuff: Uber. Just get a cheap taxi.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I think I need a car as well. In most cities, your car is fine, but I've never had a car and I'm not using the city for public transit.
-----
Squarehard: There's plenty of places to get around in a car, so I'm sure it'll be a good idea.
-----
Ferris Bueller: I think it depends on how fancy your apartment is. I'm in an apartment that is pretty cheap, but the one I live is a rental with $100,000 in cash on hand.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: Oh, that's okay. I'm a small business and like to maintain and improve the overall business of the apartment, so I'm not building a brand new business apartment for pennies on the dollar.
I'd probably just ask my roommate for a full apartment lease, but I think paying a bit more would be a good start in that direction.
-----
Squarehard: I can only speak to a small number of cities, but this is exactly the kind of places I would like to avoid.

~!~What should we know about the political climate in Germany?

Atom Heart Mother: Germany is on the rise and Chancellor Angela Merkel is unpopular, yet has been in office for the past decade. The German electorate are fed up and will either vote for the rightward shift or populist right-wing change.
What should we know about the political climate in Germany? This is tricky because the far right are on the rise and the leftward direction is the Meimar Republic. But is it right to say that the rise of the far right is a result of the Meimar Republic?
We know that the center right started with the Re-Incorporation of the Nazis. Then after many years of right-wing populists, consisting of the far-right National Socialists of Germany, Leidner-Politik and the like, the populist far right parties in the whole country began to grow and then the Meimar republic collapsed.
We also know that the political climate in Germany has been largely stagnant for decades.
But what about the climate in Germany? The far right has been on the rise, but not because of the Meimar republic. The far-right has been relatively uncontroversial and even moderate, but they are not moderate because the left populist parties have lost their majority.
What about the climate in Germany after WW2?
There are a lot of arguments. But the far right started dominating politics and eventually mainstream parties collapsed. This trend will continue in the next few decades.
What do we know? It's a mixed bag. Is it right to say that the rise of the far right is result of the Meimar Republic? Does it matter? Yes. But what about the political climate in Germany after WW2? Is it right to say that the rise of the far right is due to the Meimar Republic?
I mean, I'm not saying we should blame the rise of the Nazis. I'm just curious as to what the answer is.
-----
Muffin: I think it's important to get perspectives from other people here as well.
I'm not sure if there's a direct answer to your question (though I'll try to keep my original thought brief), but I think there's a clear answer that's more likely to be a two way street: the rise of the Nazis and the post-WW2 climate are more likely to be driven by factors outside of your control.

SOLDIER: A few days ago The Verge posted a story on a jump-list in which 3D ticket sales were up like 20% in the state. Now, it’s not a huge deal for Arcadia, but it’s a nice step up from the concerns that were raised in the Polygon and Destin articles I’ve seen.
And the buzz surrounding it is getting some credence, especially with the buzz surrounding Avengers 4.
-----
BDS: From my experience the problem with Arcadia is that it's a much more abstract and abstract movie. It's less about the actual plot and more about some sort of cinematic universe.
-----
Strafer: I don't get it.
-----
KtotheRoc: I'm with you on this.
-----
BDS: I'm absolutely baffled that people are so excited about these things.
-----
Hobbesian Thudercat: I don't think that's true. 3D is a full-featured, three-dimensional movie, and Arcadia is a story of two "full" characters.
-----
SOLDIER: Bumping this because it seems like a good point.
-----
Mesoian: Yup. Good on the industry for making this a thing.
-----
Mesoian: The point is, people are excited by the potential of 3D so it makes sense, because it's a major step up from watching a movie and knowing the plot beforehand.
-----
Daitokuji: The trend is the filmmakers are becoming more "original" while still having their original vision. 3D is getting more and more original with every release.

~!~Microsoft Teams is getting a redesign

julian: I’m on mobile and tired at work, so I wanted to ask if anyone here is looking at getting a proper “matt” redesign.
This is really old news, but it seems to be new territory for Microsoft and their updates plan.
-----
Transistor: I'm pretty sure I can think of a redesign that would make this group better, but this looks like a bad idea
Microsoft has done this before with Wonderwall and other standalone products, but it seems to be dead
-----
Antrax: Not really. The only reason I know about it is because I passed through it the other day and the redesign is not very good.
-----
TheAbsolution: Oh, I'm also tired.
-----
KarmaCow: Pretty sure there's already a design for Teams here, they just need to improve it a bit.
-----
bmdubya: I just want it to look like they have a full version of Word, Excel, and other modern web based features.
-----
TarpitCarnivore: They haven't even launched it yet. They've just launched an incremental version.
-----
DGenerator: I mean, not really.
-----
julian: Wow. I think I’ll just use this for Office 365.

~!~The Hilarious and the Ridiculous

Reynolds Woodcock: The movie about a kid who has been having suicidal thoughts for years.
I want to point out that I am not talking about a general media piece, I want to talk about a film made specifically to deal with those thoughts.
I was thinking of a similar thing where I watched this for the "trick."
-----
Devenir Ácrata: I remember this in the late 80s and it was a nice spoof at the time.
-----
Creation_Scapes: That’s because he’s a fucking idiot. 
I think your best bet for a rewatch is to take the original and add to it, I guess.
-----
The Adder: They went for a real feel good version of the original by the end in a rented trailer for this, and that is still a movie.
-----
Dead Prince: 
-----
Reynolds Woodcock: Sorry, this thread's not thread worthy.
-----
Creation_Scapes: Thank you!
-----
Mona: i knew that movie was going to be a real thing
-----
The Adder: It's a parody of the original.
-----
Creation_Scapes: Yes, that is a really good movie.

~!~I've spent the past week just staring at my tv. Where to start?

Halo 2: I've been watching a lot of horror lately and as I have to watch it at work it's become irritating. I'd say start with the original (The Wolf-Spider) and then watch that.
-----
Syder: The original (Gwenpool)
A great story, but the writing and acting in that are terrible.
The second (Garden) movie is an improvement, but I'd say start with the original and watch the second.

====================
~!~Anything you want to know about?

shaneo632: I'm sick, I'm in bed, bedridden and at work. I've been on a strict regiment of exercise for the past week or so.

shaneo632: I'd like to know that I need to have a health problem to work out the days I don't want to do it.
I've seen some YouTube videos of people doing the Impossible Burger, which is really good, but it's probably not a good idea.
-----
Shadybiz: I just want to know how to make a healthy cereal.
I don't want to sit in a chair for hours on end.

~!~I watched The Longest Day I've Ever Seen Seen a Horror Film

Andrew Korenchkin: I think it was actually from The Thing? 
I watched it after seeing the movie that The Longest Day I've Ever Seen. I don't remember much of the plot, but the entire thing was scary.
Have never seen this movie, but someone post their best movie!
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I watched The Thing with my girlfriend a couple of months ago too. I don't remember much of the movie, but I do remember a lot of stuff like books, horror movies, and a crew that worked for a video game publisher. 
Anyone know some specific genres of horror? It's a lot of genres, but it doesn't feel like it's all horror. It's more like suspense, suspenseful horror, or horror with a "twist"

====================
~!~In case you missed it the first two episodes of Stranger Things were pretty good.

RPGamer92: I've been rewatching all the seasons of this show all over the internet but I'm realizing I haven't watched it all yet. I don't know why but I came across a trailer for the first episode and I'm staring at this picture of this crazy old lady sitting on the porch next to the glass window. She seems to be a fan of Stranger Things and this trailer is going to be good.
-----
Addleburg: Never watched the show, but the first episode of the second season is up on Netflix. Looks like this lady (maybe?) played by Morgan Ward is looking for a fight scene.
-----
Rendering...: I think some people just didn't like the whole "second season" feeling. The two seasons are great, by the way.

~!~What are the best blockbusters and why?

Vermillion: So, like many, I'm fairly new to this subject, but I was curious about this question because I like to keep up with the MUHLY RECENT horror as well as the genre with a certain level of consistency. 
So I was talking with someone about The Conjuring and I saw a few movies that I thought were the best if horror by AIM and Vernor Vinge.
But I also have a very weird perspective. I'm thinking about The Phantom Menace and I'm thinking about The Conjuring. I'm thinking about The Witch. I'm thinking about The Frankenstein monster. I'm thinking about Salem's Lot. I'm thinking about The Hounds of Mars and, for some time now, I'm thinking about The Nun.
So, I'm thinking that these are the best offenders, maybe the best horror-b movies, and I'd love for them to have been made. Any suggestions?
-----
Deleted member 1258: The Hounds of Mars
Is this a joke?
-----
sph3re: Frankenstein's
Hounds of Mars
The Nun
If a movie is good, it's good.
If not, it's bad.
-----
Blackpuppy: I’m also thinking about Phantom Menace, and I’m thinking about The Hounds of Mars. I’m thinking about Frankenstein, too.
-----
TheCthultist: Conjuring
The Conjuring is easily the best horror of the last year.
-----
TheIlliterati: The Witch
The Conjuring
The Conjuring
The Hounds of Mars
Superbad.gif
-----
Triggerhappytel: I think I've picked up a decent selection of blockbusters in recent years. I'm sure there are a lot of good horror movies but I'm not really interested in them all. The Conjuring was pretty good for a while but I don't really recall any of them being good enough to justify a proper release.
-----
Dook's Revenge: The Witch
The Witch
The Conjuring
The Conjuring
The Conjuring
-----
Vermillion: Yeah, I think my only real pick is The Witch. I love Lovecraft, but I'm a big fan of horror movies and don't even care about any of them.

~!~(CNN)Seoul - A high-ranking member of the ruling People's Democratic Party steps down

Mr.Mike: Full article: 
Another step down from the country's most likely to be biggest recipient of political aid - China
China will lay large-scale sanctions on North Korea later this week, making it the first major nation to impose sanctions on Pyongyang.
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Yang Ming-hong announced that the country would send its largest delegation to North Korea in support of the latest nuclear deal, which was finalised last Friday. North Korea has previously denied any talks with China were serious about the nuclear deal.
-----
Yoshichan: Jesus fucking Christ
-----
Dennis8K: Oh.
-----
sir_crocodile: the best sanctions
-----
Mr.Mike: The most important part from what I've seen is probably the part about NK's nuclear capabilities. There's no way NK could go in that direction without China and Russia to pressure them into it.
-----
Dennis8K: Good thing I don't live in Seoul anymore.
-----
Heshinsi: I’m so glad I don’t live in a city in NK. I won’t be around that hall much longer.
-----
Khanimus: This is truly appalling. I can't begin to imagine how it must have been for China and NK to go to the 'greatest democracy' in the world.
-----
Xiao Hu: The future is now
-----
Mr.Mike: Right, but my first question is, what would it take for NK to go to the nuclear arms race? I guess a few steps down the list, but I don't think NK would be able to afford to keep up.

Cybersai: I could almost see ICE exacting the names of their muggers.

~!~Era, what's the best way to buy a new phone?

TheFallenSaboteur: I currently have a 6S and I'm looking for something to replace the 6S Plus. I was told a few weeks ago that I could replace the battery inside the Plus with a smaller battery and I'll do just that.
I've seen some articles talking about different models with different battery types and I'm wondering what's the best way to go about doing this? I noticed that a battery inside the Plus is just as good as a battery inside the S or X. Is there some better option? I'm not looking for a phone that will run the new stock android. I'm also interested in getting a battery with a dual sim version as I'm a family man and don't have much else to do. Both options would be great, right?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Battery thinnies are the same around your phone.
-----
Gustaf: i use a statik gpu for web browsing and i dont use a gcam
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Oh, I forgot that I need a cpu for web browsing. I dont know if it b bug but it would be pretty annoying.
-----
Bjones: Have you looked into Moto G6 and S4 models?
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Oh yeah, I've looked into Moto G6 and S4 models too. I'll look into those when I have the time.
-----
tsampikos: The Moto G5 Plus is really good for a low cost phone.
-----
lenovox1: The Xr is fine for what you're looking for. It's a cheaper phone that can run Android and offers the same specs as the S4.
-----
Bjones: Yeah, I definitely read that as the current lack thereof in the USA.
-----
C for Chewbacca: This is not true. I feel like the Xr is a bit too small for your liking. It's also cheaper.
If you want a battery that can run Android you also want to consider a OnePlus 6T.

Haziqonfire: I don't know how to get my eyes to the TV right colors, but I tried a few different things and each one had issues.
Turning on the TV with my earpiece is quite funny and I can play stuff like Netflix in it but my eyes are still super tired and it's starting to get annoying.
Only way to get it to turn on is to turn it off first.
But my eyes still have a hard time getting used to the color change.
Anyone have any suggestions?

Teh Hamburglar: I thought you were having a hard time. It's gonna be a long ass day.
-----
Yaboosh: I use the Blu-ray player. I mean I hope you aren't having a hard time.
-----
Hollywood Duo: The TV is connected via a USB power line.
-----
Haziqonfire: That's my problem, my eyes are pretty tired right now. I'm not sure what to do. I think I'll just keep using my PS4 just to turn it on.
-----
MikeHattsu: Try changing the color temperature on the TV to a warm one (Like I did in the OP) :
-----
Haziqonfire: I will have to find a way to do that, but I'll have to wonder if this is how it works with my PS4.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Just an advice / suggestion or any help is appreciated.
-----
Mr.Mike: Keeping the color temperature around -20C is the only way to go.
-----
kageroo: I think it's the connection issue that's a problem? I don't think so. 
You do have to figure out if your eyes are tired during the night or after.

~!~Why do so many people have so little patience for things like the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy?

Occam: I'm sure many of us are familiar with the prequels: the stories about the Knights of Ren, the rise to power during the age of technology, the fall of the Jedi, the rise and fall of the Empire and so on.
But even though there are many of us, many of us still have no patience for these stories.
The prequels were for the most part, a good read but a bad read.
There is nothing really good about them and it is just impossible to find fault with them.
I'm sure there are good ones and bad ones, but these are the ones that are most often used as a scapegoat for the Prequel phenomenon.
I'm sure many of us also know that the quest for Grevious ended unsatisfactoryly and that Kathleen Kennedy's plan for a sequel was...something else entirely.
I'm just curious as to how the responses vary from person to person.
-----
vestan: I don't have any issues with the prequels either. They're pretty self explanatory.
-----
Khanimus: There is a lot of good prequel stories that didn't make it to the sequel, and there are some good ones that will never make it forward.
-----
Occam: It's not hard to figure out. If you don't have a problem with the ending, the fans are right.
-----
Kinggroin: I have no issues with them, they are just that the ending wasn't really for me.
-----
signal: The Last Jedi is the best one though.
-----
Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!: I have no problem with the quality of the prequel stuff but if you don't like the beginning then you won't like the end either hab.
-----

TheBeardedOne: I don't have a problem with the beginning of any story, but the "beginning" is a bit of a misnomer, since it's not a beginning and the end is a problem. The "end" is a problem because it's not a problem.

CormoranStrike: I don't think I've ever read a post from someone who thought the original trilogy was good, so I have no problem with that, but I do have a problem with the

-----
Trouble: I thought it was hilarious.

Sub Level: I didn't say anything of the movie or the story until I saw the name and I thought the "name" was John or the like.
But since I thought it was more clever than that, might have been funny.

Sony ZF3
HP Elite+ One (kind of like the ZX and no other portable)
Sony Vegas MP3
HP Elite Play
Or if you're looking for the best portable, the Sony WH-1000
-----
signal: I'm not sure but just using Spotify for my music is what I would consider the best.
-----
fluffydelusions: I’ve been using a Logitech Ultrasharp for a year now. It’s been fantastic. I use the iphone X for music and it’s amazing. I just bought a second row as a way to stream my music to my laptop at work. I’ve also used a vocoder setup for music and it’s great. I don’t use my phone or tablet for music though.
-----
crimzonflame: I've been using this for the last month and it works great.
-----
bremon: I’ve been using my Sony WI-1000 for years. I love it. I can store music on it and I can play it over the air without any sort of internet connection issues. It’s great. I’d say the w5500 is the best portable music player you’ll find.

~!~How do you deal with anxiety?

entremet: I've had a mild panic attack for the first time in my life. My anxiety is still relatively high now, but it's gotten to the point where it's starting to get to the point where I'm going to go to the ER for a panic attack. It's still a bit terrifying, but I'm not insane.
I've suffered from PTSD for quite some time now. I can't imagine dealing with that since I've dealt with that since I was a child. I can't even imagine the feelings of regret and guilt that I would have felt had I experienced that. I've also been dealing with trauma since I started working, but I'm still very afraid. I also don't know how I'll react and/or be comfortable with the thoughts I have when I have them. I've been dealing with severe anxiety since I was a kid. I'm still freaked out but relieved to know that it's not a problem of my life. 
How do you deal with anxiety without knowing it's an issue? Which is it for you?

Ogodei: I am an addict and will self medicate when I'm ready. I'm afraid of doing so, I'm anxious about it, and it's getting worse daily. But, I do have a good coping mechanism. I'll try to be mindful and make sure I'm not doing something until I'm ready.
-----
Dice: The best thing to do is just be aware that you're in a real mess until you figure out what's going on and it's over with :(
that's how I deal with it, OP. I'm sorry your loss. That's how I handle anxiety and the thoughts that come from it.

Deleted member 9145: You were never much of a fan of the original eight, but then you read through the Beatles discographies you begin to wonder, are they as big a deal as they say?
The original Eight are 8 classics and arguably the most influential rock album ever released, while they're arguably as much a big deal as they say. They're still around and there's no doubt that they're still a big deal.
What happened to them? Was it the same sort of post-WW2 UK music that bucked the trend of having so much new new music every year, or is it a different zeitgeist?
-----
Mr. X: I dunno I think I'd say they're still big deal.
-----
Deleted member 9145: The late 80s/early 90s were very different from the 90s/2000s I think
-----
Lashley: I don't know, I think the '80s/2000s era was pretty big for 'serious' Beatles
-----
Mr. X: I would say they were more of a 'festival' of sorts, some of the best gems were played by different acts.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't think there was any bigger event like the Beatles had been touring or rehearsing for.
-----
CormoranStrike: I mean, the music was still around for a couple of years after they retired from touring so who knows. It was not a big deal.

Deleted member 9145: They were still in some festivals, I believe

I just want to be absolutely clear that I don't believe that every woman should vote. That's just my opinion, and I don't have any expert opinion on it. I'm not saying that every person should vote. But I do believe that I've learned something valuable about how emotions are expressed.
I can't fathom that people who don't know what a voting is, or who aren't civilized, are led to think that they are just the default set of emotional manipulation that most people just can't understand. They are allowed to "believe" what they're told because they're told a bunch of things and can therefore "feel" what they're told.
If you can't even understand what a voting is or need to understand some of the emotional manipulation for some of the reasons that I mentioned in the OP, then you are either a feminist, a victim, or a victim. If you believe that voting is inherently more important than any of that, then you are either a feminist, a victim, or a victim.
I'm hoping to be proven wrong. I'm a victim. I'm just curious as to how the public, especially the left, can allow themselves to feel like that.
For those who do, how do you feel about the idea of voting?
-----
Puck Beaverton: I feel like voting is a great idea.
-----
Griselbrand: I'm not sure I buy your arguments about how voting is a bad idea. It's not like they're aliens who need to line up in order to steal your vote.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I don't like voting at all.
I vote.
If I'm not a victim then I don't care.
-----
shnurgleton: I vote.
If I'm a victim, I don't get emotional manipulation.
-----
HMS_Pinafore: I don't get emotional manipulation from my fellow man

Powdered Egg: I vote.
The world may sometimes have its moments, but the reality is we're all complicit in the system that is

~!~Why is it so easy to take pride in human life?

fireflame: I was recently reminded of mental health problems that my parents have. I am not talking about those problems that you have diagnosed yourself as having, or have been diagnosed as suffering from, a form of alcoholism. I am talking about the people that you have always been proud of.
I often think of people raising their children as ethical adults, but I never imagined that it was so easy and so important to have. It is hard because they are not always happy and I do not want to want to want to be my parents because of my condition.
I would like to know, and maybe this is related, why for some people it is so easy to feel depressed and anxious when in reality they do not have the answers to everything.
I have to ask, why is it so important for society to have empathy?
-----
SugarNoodles: Because they are human and you can do anything you want.
-----
Elegant Weapon: Because they're not white
-----
FUME5: Because they're not Americans.
-----
NineConsonants: Because they’re happy and feel like a part of their family.
-----
SugarNoodles: Because they have empathy for it.
-----
NineConsonants: I’ve met my fair share of white folk that feel like they’re missing out if they’re treated like shit. Like they’re American, and they’re all in it together but they all agree “This is America” and they’re all racists. Like I’m so in love with it it’s just so easy to take that shit.
-----
CormoranStrike: Because they're happy and feel like part of the family.
-----
hateradio: I don't think you understand what empathy is.
It's just a tool.
-----
gcwy: Because they're not getting help, and I don't want them to be treated that way.

~!~Do you read the TSA thread?

HammerFace: The thread, as it's often said, has blown up in recent days over TSA news coverage. I've seen and read stuff like this, and I agree with the sentiment that I should read it. I don't read it and I don't travel often, so I just did the opposite. 
I recently did a layover to the airport, and just as I was about to board I noticed a man walking down the plane walking through the airport. I don't remember which part of this post happened. He was a bit drunk, and was asked if I knew who he was. I didn't respond. 
So, now I'm going to have to deal with that guy and I've been wondering, is it normal to have a conversation with someone who reads the TSA thread when you're sitting in line? He always comes across as a belligerent douchenozzle who doesn't know what they're doing. It always seems like he's always talking about how he's actually nervous about a woman coming forward about his experience, or that she is willing to be "talkative" and that she just wants to talk. 
I do understand that it's very possible that someone just doesn't know how to interpret a question you have. I'm just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and if you have any good tips for dealing with someone who reads the thread. I've read a lot about TSA threads and I think I would like to run through one myself. I just have no idea how to do it or if I'm even capable of dealing with someone.
-----
WhoaIsThatMars: I read it.
But I don't travel enough to really be in the discussion, but I agree.
-----
Halo 2: Do you travel all the time?
-----
J-Rod: You're probably not even supposed to be in the discussion.
-----
HammerFace: Nah. I try to avoid it, but I know it can be rough for people who just don't think the question is worth having. Also, I can't really say unless you're a comedian. There's probably someone who will be laughing at your absurdity or exaggerating some routine or line of thinking.

Clydefrog: How often do you travel outside of your scheduled travel times? 
As for tips, don't be a
====================
~!~How do you deal with the idea of being "too fat"

John Kowalski: I have a friend who insists that being overweight is "unhealthy" and that this is just "bad for your body" and that being happy is "bad for your soul". It seems like a really strange conversation to have, and it's a bit odd to talk about eating well together with someone you've never met until you've been obese.
I didn't want to bring the subject up into discussion because I feel like it will just get brought up again in the next few days or weeks, but I'm not entirely sure what to do. I don't want to be like someone who's always been about the same unhealthy idea and will suddenly be told to stop? I'm not sure how you guys deal with being overweight and wanting better, healthy and healthy. I imagine that a lot of people are already doing that, and that it's normal and part of life, but I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking the conversation. I do think it's possible for people to grow up around the idea of being overweight and wanting better, healthy and healthy, but I'm not sure how to approach that.
-----
shnurgleton: eat smaller
not the fat
-----
TheSkullPrince: What's unhealthy is finding out the smallest person you see fits in.
-----
CrazyDude: It's unhealthy when you know it's unhealthy because you were skinny and happy to walk around and stuff.
-----
Powdered Egg: I think that's the weirdest thing I've ever heard someone say. I just feel like it's normal to be overweight and happy when you're getting treatment. It doesn't make sense to me.
-----
Mahonay: When I was growing up I was skinny, skinny, skinny.
Now I'm a skinny, fat and healthy and still have lots of energy packed.
-----
CrazyDude: This was the first time I ever heard the word overweight. I had a pretty small ego.
-----
BriGuy: I mean, you're probably right. It's probably healthy for you.
-----
Gupa: Eat a little smaller than you want to be.
It helps when you understand that you are most likely skinny because you are still skinny.
-----
dragonchild: I'm counting things as 'healthy'.

~!~What is the best way to watch 4k movies?

Richiek: I’ve been watching a lot of 4k movies over the past few months, and I’ve noticed that a lot of them are getting pretty lackluster reviews. It’s driving me insane. I want to watch something awesome, but I can’t seem to find the right source material to do so. I’ve seen a lot of movies that I think are available on iTunes or Vudu, but can’t seem to find a good source that explains why certain 4k movies are entertaining enough to watch.
Any suggestions?
-----
StuBurns: I wouldn't want to watch a movie theater without any kind of audio track.
-----
Richiek: Thanks. I'll look into this.
-----
signal: .
-----
thediamondage: if you can't find the source, why not look into the youtube version that comes with the tv?
-----
Richiek: I love the tv version! I've been trying to find it on Vudu, but it's not streaming anywhere that I can download on my PC.
-----
BDS: Why do people get mad when movies with 4K yet remastered ones are getting a 4K stream? I'm guessing it's for 4K HDR.
-----
Richiek: That’s what I guess, but I don’t know enough about the sources to really know much about them.
-----
BDS: I mean, they usually come with a digital code either directly or via the app itself. I know that doesn't apply to streaming or UHD, but I've never seen it.

Deleted member 1258: What's the most you ever spent on a meal?
And by meal, I mean how much did you spend on the meal itself? What was it like?
This is the typical "eat, just eat" meal. If you want to be specific, I'm sorry for grammar. But don't worry, I'm just curious.

NineConsonants: $50 USD. The meal was delicious and expensive, but I had a nice crisp and plum I had sitting on top of my plate and I had some nice salty salad on it.

~!~The Ringer (UK) The Monarchy and the Sex behind the Curve

PintSizedSlasher: Full article at the link. I just finished the first chapter. Very fascinating. I didn’t know how they managed to capture the attention of so many people that didn’t get their own articles/shows. One of my favorite recent examples is The Ringer’s coverage of Pride Month in France. 
The article is short and focuses on two themes. One, money and power. One thing I haven’t explored much before is money and power. Well, the Ringer did an episode on Money and Power with Rich Pedo and it touched on this quite deeply. 
Two, identity. I found this article quite fascinating and I am curious about how they operate. I’m hoping this article will inspire others to think about it a bit more. I’m still not convinced that the internet in general is a mistake (although maybe I am wrong). 
The first is identity. This is a very shallow point of view. In this country, white Americans certainly feel the need to belong to a social hierarchy and think they are above everyone else. Yet, it isn’t that simple. 
Why is this relevant? Well, I’m sure that a significant number of Americans feel they feel the power they rightfully hold above others. And this identity is what makes us successful. We are successful because we are successful in our own self-interest, and our success lies in being big enough that they can control who we are as slaves.
-----
PintSizedSlasher: I’m sorry for not having a good answer to the first question. I’m not saying this is the answer. But I’m curious about the second question. 
Also a lot of people don’t know who I’m talking to them about money and power. I have a friend who was a millionaire when he was younger. Does he want to be part of that?
-----
Kieli: It's not the money and power that's the problem, it's identity. In particular, the way you're describing money and power makes no sense when you consider how rich people are without actually being poor ones.

~!~How can we fix the terrible public transit system in the US?

Deleted member 25709: There is a public transit system in the US.
The major routes are:
Way 1: Manhattan
Way 2: Manhattan
Way 3: Manhattan
What's stopping them from getting to the other stations (way 4) or the big train stations (way 3)?
-----
Dishwalla: I don't know how much the Penn Station would be improved over the current system. I guess it depends on your definition of "better."
-----
Linkark07: Manhattan.
Way 2 would take immense distances. I believe it would take 5-10 hours to reach Penn Station from the subway.
-----
xxracerxx: Manhattan would be the first stop.
Way 3 would be a relief.
-----
MikeProtagonist: The Penn Station would be the greatest place to go to while still getting to the train stations.
-----
dancingphlower: It would take 5-10 hours to get to Penn Station.
-----
sphagnum: Way 3 would be the obvious improvement.
-----
JasonMCG: A train would take an hour of every up-and-coming station in the US.
-----
Deleted member 35777: If the trains were spaced out more naturally I could get to the most exciting things sooner.
-----
Silvergun-Blue: There's no way the current system works. I mean, it's not like a train carrying more people than a subway going through the south.

~!~You have a dream. How do you deal with it?

Bman94: This is my dream, if I may say that. A little bit of an underverturpose in the office (which I'm sure is the number one cause of workplace stress) but still a dream.
So I've had a dream. It's a few years old, but I've been in a persistent dream for a few years now. I have a dream. It's now in my head that I have this absolute terrible dream that I've been suffering from right now. I have the absolute nightmare that I think is this:
A woman that wants to date me, me and my boy for the first time. She has an entire fantasy about us and wants to date me. Or maybe it's a fantasy because I've never really had a dream like that before. Either way, I'm still trying to figure out how to deal with it. 
Is this fantasy nightmare real? 
I don't want to make a scene or something. But if it makes me feel worse, I just have to deal with it. 
I don't know what else to say?
-----
Fat4all: I love dreams
-----

CormoranStrike: Nothing can hold it back for more than a few minutes.
-----
Bakercat: I love my dreams. I love how they can make me feel good even when I know that it is all a dream.

Deleted member 14002: You are dreaming.

Stop dreaming.

Bakercat: I feel like shit all of a sudden. I've been taking a nap lol.

DrSlek: When I'm feeling down I tend to just ask myself "why didn't you notice this earlier?" and it's one of the only times I've done this a few things have gone differently than others.

badboy78660: For those unaware, this dude has been making (humorously obtuse) videos on the grade level of the various states schools in the US for the last few years, most notably New York.
-----
Mesoian: As a kid in HS, I always let my teachers put me on the top of my class to let them know I was a good student. Not just good, but pretty cool.
-----
badboy78660: I remember reading a story about this guy on Twitter.
-----
Mesoian: Every so often as a kid I'd sit somewhere on the reading list or just sit and read a book, it's a good way to unwind after a hard day or work or whatever. But that was back when I was a kid.
-----
Ziltoidia 9: I always got a book when I was younger but I couldn't read it.
-----
badboy78660: Yeah, this guy is really cool though, I can see him getting recommended to me now.
-----
Tobor: I was really into this guy after I heard he had a series on YouTube. There was a few of the replies he put up on the radio but no one ever said much for the books.
-----
Daffy Duck: I remember reading that he had some really cool videos.
-----
badboy78660: I've listened to all three and he's definitely cool. I hope that's the case with others.
-----
Tobor: I'm going to keep the Spotify recommendation in mind. I'm guessing he's got good original content and he could easily be a decent Youtube celeb creator.

====================
~!~LttP: The Sopranos

SolVanderlyn: I've heard very mixed reactions to this movie. I enjoyed it, but hated it. I'm not as into the overall story as some of my friends, but I do think some of the acting was sloppy, and the plot was a bit of a mess.
That said, I liked the characters, tried to watch some of the scenes way more, and found myself more impressed with how the story told. I'm still a sucker for long, high budget TV drama, but I'm a sucker for slow, methodical TV drama.
I think most people can agree that this was the best TV drama of the last decade, but I think this movie was actually on the tier of dramas that are "fast-paced", and that are actually good. I think this distinction is a huge mistake, because I think non-TV drama is just a non-form of self-reflection of the original TV drama.
What did you guys think of The Sopranos?
-----
WaffleTaco: It has an interesting premise but some of the acting is jumbled and frankly not something I would ever want to watch again. I’d recommend the movie if I were to watch it again.
-----
Irnbru: Loved it when I saw it a while back
-----
Griselbrand: It's a ton of fun and the writing is pretty good.
-----
jrush64: The writing is pretty jumbled but it's fun and the acting is great.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It was good, but I wouldn't call it a good movie. It was slow, it wasn't suspenseful, and the plot wasn't suspenseful at all.
-----
TheCrackedJack: It's a really fun movie. 
I liked it more than I expected it to.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Yes, I definitely liked it more than I expected.
The writing was pretty jumbled and messy, but I thought the characters were really interesting.
-----
Griselbrand: I thought the writing was pretty jumbled and messy. The odd scene I ended to think about the writing was when they were trying to get their head around the part where the president is holding up a picture of Ronald Reagan with a blood soaked MAGA hat.

~!~The Cut: The web of savagery that surrounds all forms of media

Don Fluffles: I thought this was a pretty funny video posted at all. I’ve seen it so many times. It’s an easy way for the web of savagery to survive and thrive. 
This is a summary:
As a father of a 3 year old and my own dog, this is something I’ve had my sights set on for years. I want to discuss the web of savagery that surrounds all forms of media, but that’s hard to do when we live in an era of social media. 
The cut:
There are many examples of graphic content including porn, porn covers, horror, thrillers, books, movies, games, etc. 
There are things in most media that are obviously meant to be consumed, but they are meant to be consumed in a graphic and graphic way. 
The spoiler tags in the comments, for example. 
The thumbnail for something that has a spoiler in them. 
Not unlike the infamous thumbnail for a thumbnail, a thumbnail for a video, but a thumbnail for a movie. 
I’m sure many in the web of savagery are familiar with the design and behavior of video cards, monitors, and other embedded content. They also know exactly what they are doing.
I think it’s important for us to not allow the web of savagery. We need to remove these embedded content from all platforms as soon as possible.
-----
subpar spatula: When the food company makes a thumbnail or YouTube finds out that an artist and someone else attached to it and are then spoonfeeding it to people, they can go down a rabbit hole of information.
-----
dallow_bg: If I watch a video without any filter, I don't care enough to click on the title.
-----

The Albatross: This is what I do, and it's what I use for all my embedded YouTube videos.
My girlfriend is a graphic designer, so her job is to make videos for clients and then tell them what to find, whether they're artist links, whether they're for free or paid, etc.
I don't watch a whole lot of YouTube, but I've got a lot of videos that I go through and it's kind of neat to hear about the things

DrROBschiz: This is like saying Trump can't be bothered to tell him to stop
Or he's just a man who is looking for attention
-----

-----
VectorPrime: No one in the history of the world could possibly be bothered to tell a President that his actions have caused harm to the US.

Coyote Starrk: He is a man of many emotions. 
Not that Trump is anything to go by but he is the President and the world around.

~!~Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight"

Pachimari: Originally the Dark Knight Rises was a Batman movie that I would have liked to see but I didn't want to be too serious and instead looked into Toph because it was good for a thriller and I liked the plot twist that the killer of Rea Lumpkin is a member of the occult and that the Joker is a "noble"
But the internet is not good with this type of movies and I don't know how that movie compares to the original, so I'm not sure if this is a bad thing or not.
Anyway, I've seen the movie since it came out and I really liked it and I still think it's a good movie. But I really want to like this movie, I do think I'll buy this to watch when I'm alone.

~!~Lemons are weird but I think they are legit

Coyote Starrk: I have loved em but have always felt they are generally more of a novelty to me. I would say that I am a fan of the "real" version but I have never really enjoyed the style of theirs.
What do you like? Is it something that is "new" to you?
-----
Airegin: I don't like em. I like the feel of em but I don't feel they are the most "real" thing.
-----
Poppy: i like them but im not really into them
i love them as a goofy kind of kid but they don’t hold up very well as a whole- i really like the look and the candy bar flavour- it was slickly made
-----
Coyote Starrk: No, I know that it's not what I like but I don't hate it either. I know I'm going to be weirded out by them but I don't feel like talking to people who are like "haha you like this, you like this, you like this"
-----
Coyote Starrk: I like em and I do not feel like talking to people who are like "oh you like this, you like this, you like this". Maybe I am just weirded out.
-----
Neece: They're fun.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I wanted to like em but they just don't hold up as well as I want. It's like I'm trying to explain to my friends that they like them but they get weirded out when I see them sitting in a chair or when I see them in a car seat or something. They are just not as good.
-----
Dereck: They're not bad, but I feel like I can only appreciate them when I'm sitting in a chair with an empty desk.
-----
Coyote Starrk: Nah I'm good. I'm just not into sitting in a chair with a empty desk. I don't like the look of them either. I am just not into sitting down with a bunch of people who are probably trying to get ahead and make a quick buck.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I mean I just don't get them. I like the sheer amount of personalities displayed. I also don't get the pop culture references. Because

~!~How do you handle your day?

entremet: Seems like it's not just me, but also your fellow Resetters. How do you handle your day? Do you enjoy waking up, getting ready, reading the news, playing games, or doing other things. Personally, it's hard to get started to get these thoughts in my head. I'm not one to be too depressed or anxious. I just feel like I'm going to sleep and finish it at some point. Maybe this is my insecurity, but I'm not very happy with my life and don't really have a desire to go for a happy ending. I just don't like to think about what's going on in the future.
How do you guys handle your day?

Teh Hamburglar: My morning thoughts are:
Dorm
Dining
Going to the office for the first day to get dressed
Getting dressed
Going to a Starbucks or something like that.

~!~What is the best/most Recent “Bojack Horseman”? (no spoilers)

Biestmann: A recent thread spurred me to think about whether or not my own opinion of the book is what’s best understood. I’m sure there are a lot of opinions here.
Let’s start with the obvious: the book is great. It’s batshit insane.
The first time I read the book, I was enamored by the sheer beauty of the setting. The setting was magical, the town has been blown out from the trees in the beginning, and the characters are just like, "That's Cyke, the main character. She’s a psychic person. She’s a sex addict who has a boyfriend. She’s one of those “heroic” characters,” like, “Yeah. But we have this unsorted existential crisis that we’re in, and we have to stop it because we’re wilding ourselves.”
The main characters are characters with very different histories. They’re the people who are the protagonists of a story. And they don’t have to follow a set-up to explain themselves. They can be really silly, superwit, just generally relatable. And they get to do something spectacular if they get the right message in. The world, the world-destroying witches, the whole 'murdering witches' thing, the whole mess in this world. The witches are the protagonists of the story, but they are also the protagonists of a story. Everything about the world, the very beginning, the ending, the very end is just done out of choice.
What would you think, ERA?
-----
Biestmann: I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. I’ve come to appreciate the book more than I originally thought I would.
-----
Okabe: The book is a mishmash. It’s great but it’s not as fantastic as the show makes it out to be.
-----
Rover: It has its moments, but the plot is muddled and the characters are just mean.
-----
Muppet of a Man: I liked it quite a bit. I’d argue that it’s better than the HBO show (although I still wish the books were

~!~Anecdotally, I've been getting the "What Happened?" video on Netflix. I need to know my sources

Rivenblade: I watched the video and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Like, it's not the movie I want to see. It's a comedy show about a person who gets fed up with the way some people feed their pets the world they love. I didn't want to be upset with the dad. I want to know he is fed with the dog. He is fed with the cat. He is fed with the dog. He is fed with the cat. I don't know what happens next.
I don't want to get upset with anyone. I just want to know what happened. I just want to know what the fuck happened. Please help me understand at this stage.
-----
Unicorn: I am curious how you feel about this.
-----
Fat4all: i don’t think you should feel upset with your parents for feeding your cat that sound advice
-----
Rivenblade: I think that is the kind of thing your therapist would say. Thanks.
-----
Fat4all: I think the point is that people are not always good at digesting the idea of what they want to hear, so you can explain that to the parents and let them know what happened.

DrROBschiz: I just want to know what happened

EchoChamber: I feel your pain OP

Also, any tips for picking a place? I know that's hard for me to do, but I wish I had something specific to do.

I was in Scotland for a few months. Was a fun country.

~!~What is your favorite out of the gate movie?

Scarecrow: I'm not talking about a film that just came out, I'm talking about stuff that you see in theaters and think is visually stunning.
What's your favorite movie that you've seen through some varying degrees of a different lens?
Here are mine:
-----
TheRedSnifit: I like the one where the bee and firefly are on a spaceship.
-----
TheSkullPrince: I've seen Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Justice League through the wagon and they're all pretty damn cool.
-----
cognizant: I've seen The Wizard of Oz through the screen as a kid and while entertaining, it's never quite the same without the visuals. It's a pretty muted light to end up with a lot of shots moving around a bit.
-----

AnansiThePersona: Not sure what your expecting from this, but this is a movie that started off as a kid nostalgia thing and has progressively aged to this point.
-----
Khanimus: The Last Jedi.
I've seen it my son, but he's so into it that I don't know if I'll see it till he's old enough to remember the movie.
-----
Dook's Revenge: Shrek.

Taki: I thought the first one was the bee, then I saw the firefly. Then I seen the 2 new ones.

~!~New York Review of Books has a major critique of Trump's "deplorable candidacy."

-----
legacyzero: I'm sick of ppl tolerating this guy's bullshit
-----
Phrozenflame500: a good portion of the critique is ideological. there's a lot of fucked-up bullshit in the US, and that should be addressed, but the criticism isn't without merit.
-----
uzipukki: Good article. 
I unfortunately live in Minneapolis and have only ever visited NY in the past year to see what we've been up to. I'm totally fine living in the same city in which I live, but I'm aware that I'm not very good at laying out my city's future directions. My university recently hired a couple of people that are left wing. They hired a couple that are a little racist, but not very good at making sure the students they hire are diverse. I've had friends that have had their political opinions told them outright that they are terrible, but that they are worth having.

I've got a Macbook Pro (2011 Macbook Air, 128GB) and a 2011 MBP (Silverstone, 17" 2011 MBP) plus 256GB of RAM, and hate all the specs and features of my current laptop. I was just curious about the concept and I'll be getting one of these to test it out.
I've already seen many people complaining about the keyboard being beefy and the battery being big. I haven't seen many people having issues with the keyboard at all.
Anything I could possibly compare to? I just want a laptop that I can use for work and not be a computer.
Also, if anyone has any suggestions.

~!~The Alt Right is being unfairly accused

Doober: I think a lot of those are misguided attempts at an understanding of recent events, particularly how the alt-right is generally derided by the right.
Edit:
And the alt-right have responded:
-----
Carl2216: Oh, I thought that was about the right.
I was just thinking that this has been a thread I've been thinking about for months, but I'm sure a mod cares enough to lock.
-----
Branu: The alt right is often mischaracterized as a movement of racists with skinhead tendencies, rather than a racist regime that demonises them. 
Rather, I would say that the alt-right is a movement that demonises minorities, and that people like Trump are too often good for the most part because they are working class.
-----
Chojin: Funny. I can't help but to wonder why people think they are being unfairly accused.
The Alt Right can be described as a bunch of racist bigots. Racists working class, and "anti leftists" while being "pro left" (which as far as I know is a stretch). 
This is a group that does not want any kind of social justice revolution. They want to divide us, and all they've got is "fuck the left" and their love of Harriet Tubman. 
The hatred they have for the left is being unfairly accused.
-----
EkStatiC: Just because they are called racists does not mean they are being called out correctly.
-----
Mahonay: Yep. 
I'm not sure this is a good idea.
-----
Platy: I thought the alt right was called the Alt-Left ? Why ?
Edit:
Never mind, I meant the Alt Right.
-----
SolicitorPirate: I mean...
-----
BrassDragon: I don't think this is a good idea.
All marginalized people are by definition bad people. They are not a special race. Racists (well white people) using the left as a weapon are not a special race.
-----
M.Bluth: I agree that the Alt-Right is often mischaracterized as a group of racist bigots, but that does not mean that they are being unfairly accused.
They are, but they are also often viewed as being, a racial minority.

~!~The ending of Wong Kar Wai’s “Dogyu!” is tragic

Arta: “I was talking to my friend about this movie recently and he was mentioning it was “great” but he didn’t like it and then he looked at me and said “look, it’s good! I don’t like it!”
I’m going to quote from Wikipedia the quote you may remember from the Wong Kar Wai movie, where he said this and it’s true:
“If I let it get to ‘shit crazy’, I’ll let it get to me. We’ll see. But I don’t like it. I’ll let it get to me. It’s just a movie, isn’t it?”
The movie was released in 2016, and it’s not the first time I’ve seen this movie.
Was this the first time you saw this movie that you did not like it?
A friend of mine pointed out this movie was the first time I saw this movie when I was still a little kid, and while I still liked it, it was only a little bit more light-hearted than it came from. I didn’t really get it from the jump, I just thought it was kind of bland and lame. 
I’m a little surprised that people don’t say this movie was the first time they saw this movie. I guess they just weren’t a huge fan base yet, but I’m pretty sure I’d like it if it was released.
-----
Zan: I didn't like it. Was it just a bunch of people throwing stuff at the wall or was there a deeper problem?
-----
RoninChaos: I thought it was great. I thought I was going to be blown away. I think I loved it.
-----
Tagg: I was not a fan of it at all. I thought it was pretty bland and lame.

Andrew Korenchkin: I just got a little anxiety about this, because I'm the type that will react to stuff that's really stupid, but I'm also the type that will be caught up in stupid shit, and I'm not arrogant enough to say that stuff "just because I'm dumb doesn't make me a bad teacher." I just get on with it, because I just want to be known and recognized. 
But does it make you a good teacher? Do you even have to tell the students what they're doing? Do you ever feel like giving them any sort of consideration? 
I know you can't control your own reaction, but it just doesn't make you a good teacher.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I am.

ElectricBlanketFire: No, but I'm not going to judge a book.

~!~Man in wheelchair for over 10 years, finally gets around

TheBeardedOne: It's been a few years since I was the oldest person in my family, and I just got a toe thing for it. It's sort of a gadget, but it's kinda neat to have it as a gadget for being able to walk and stand when we're not busy.
It's been a long time coming, but I feel like a modern day tech and I recently moved to the agey experience area. The only thing I can think of is a wheelchair for some reason. I have it on my back, and it's kind of like a wheelchair for when I'm not paying attention to my surroundings or anything. I can stream cartoons on it for a while and it seems to have no real downside. I've got a lot of health problems, and I've always had a disability that was very public for a long time, but I can't shake that wheelchair without getting the most basic of benefits and assistance, and the only real downside is that it's basically impossible to get to my desk, and I'm working on getting that done faster and faster, but it's something I'm working on but not because I want to be a hero who can walk anytime I want to, and I'm just glad I can get off of my butt.

Zvonimir Boban: I think this one is more similar to the Power Rangers of the original Power Rangers, so yeah it's not a complete example.

Kain-Nosgoth: Shameless is a good example of this, I thought they were already so similar but it's just so so different.
-----
Dennis8K: Shameless
-----
Dennis8K: This is my favorite example. But I can't think of a better one.

Mushroomer25: This is going to be a controversial pick. I think it's probably Mike Tyson's Heavy Metal Friday in that list, although I don't think he's a better choice than the other two.

~!~"What would happen if a power ranger was re-elected?"

PeakPointMatrix: (Spoilers for the latest season)
The show has had such a long wait of nearly a year now and I thought it'd be fun to take a look at the possible repercussions of a Power Rangers reboot, if one ever happens:
1. Would it be revealed that the original Power Ranger was a plagiarist?
2. Would the original Power Ranger be promoted into First Avenger?
3. How would a marine ranger (or even a naga shark) be promoted from sea otters to marine ranger?
4. How would a ranger's current job/title be defined?
5. Would a marine ranger have any meaningful connections to the original Power Ranger's current status?
6. What would happen if a marine ranger was re-elected?
7. Would any other Power Ranger be tempted to try and claim their right to earth?
8. What would happen if a marine ranger was elected First Avenger?
9. How would a marine ranger be elected First Avenger?
10. What would happen if a marine ranger was elected First Avenger?
That being said, what would happen if a Power Ranger reboot were dropped and never aired?

Uzumaki Goku: I’m so hyped for this movie. I’m so hyped for this movie.
-----
trikster40: Sweet. Looking forward to the next time we’ll see that score.
-----
LionPride: Nah
-----
Somnid: It was ok, just average.
-----
ILikeFeet: yes, it's the best
probably more average than this
-----
The Driver: The score is on point, but it might be a bit too heavy and vibrant.
-----
CormoranStrike: It got an ok middle and it’s not that great all the time.
-----

Nimurai: This is the most tone deaf thing I've ever seen on a video game movie. I'm not even sure if I'm hyped or not, but it does sound like I'm reading too much into it.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: It's fine. It's not great.

~!~Best way to watch TV shows on Apple TV?

maximumzero: I've been using the Apple TV as a TV replacement for my collection for some time now. I'm really excited about this as Hulu has picked up The XCXR, and I'm interested in the potential of having a 4K tv as well.
But I want to get a new TV instead of buying a new 1080p TV. There are so many ways to do this that I don't know which is the best for what I'm looking for.
-----
F34R: I think the TV will just be the same as the TV before it.
-----
maximumzero: I'd rather have the full 1080p resolution than the 4k res of a 1080p TV.
-----
TheBeardedOne: The X popped up on my social media feeds recently and I watched it for the first time today. I pay for the Apple TV 4K, which is fantastic.
I have the Apple TV and I'd rather not put it down since it's more expensive.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I think I'd rather just buy a new TV with a TV model that looks the same as the TV I already have.
I’ll wait until I have a new TV to decide. I see Apple TV’s as the ‘normal’ Apple TV model, but I’ll get a regular Apple TV and watch it for the first time again.
I think the reason why I’m going to get a regular Apple TV is because I really want to own a nice OLED now.
-----
Sectorseven: Is there a difference between a regular Apple TV and an OLED?
-----
maximumzero: I'm using a 4K TV, so I'm not totally sure how good the 4K quality is. But my wife says the Apple TV is too good of a resolution to be worth the trouble.
-----
sir wallace walrus: I got a Samsung Apple TV (I think) at launch. I think the 4K streaming aspect of the TV is getting better and better and the apps I use are better now. It's still not as jacked-up as it was when I had my TV.

~!~Donald Trump calls for second presidential pardon of Alan Dershowitz

Squarehard: It's happening, further, with the upcoming bipartisan pardon of Joe Manchin, as well.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: It’s too late. What is happening?
-----
Thorn: Ironic but Trump can't take it.
-----
Clydefrog: I know I don't but I'll take it if it's real.
-----
Slayven: My lord
-----
jelly: So it is just a joke then.
-----
Mahonay: The longest sentence of any president.
-----
TheAbsolution: We don't want to let this go.
-----
Rover: lol
-----
Lemon Crest: What a joke, he should be locked up forever.

~!~Why is it so easy to buy a used car?

Hate: I bought a used Mazda 6 Grandes in 2014 and only got it 2 months later. I’m tired of the headaches and the lack of maintenance and wants to replace that car. So I thought maybe if I just paid 60 more dollars for it and not tried to buy one myself I might just get it.
I don't want to take my family out of the car but I don't want to be financially ruined over the quality of the car. It's not the price I think I would be (I'm 34) but the convenience. I don't think I'll just go without it. I just don't know if I'm wasting money.

Cocolina: It's always been a luxury purchase for foreigners
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: Because America is a fucking trash country.
-----
super-famicom: It's a luxury product.
-----
timrtabor123: It's a luxury product
-----
Slappy White: It has been a luxury product for ages. It’s a luxury product to be sold for a buck or two.
-----
zoggy: It’s a luxury product?
Why
Why?

-----
Wulfric: It's a luxury product to be sold for a buck or two.
-----
Galkinator: Why?

-----
KyleRipman: As long as there is no fixing the fucks up in my area I don't see the issue.
