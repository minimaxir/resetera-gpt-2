~!~What are your ERA favorite and most memorable foods?

Mechaplum: Talking Food and Drug Era is a bit of a strange bedfellows. I've only had a few things which were entirely terrible, likelot of the stuff you see in Italian, Japanese, Korean, Japanese, etc. I'm not talking about diner or supermarket lists or anything like that.
My favorite food is honey. I think it's one of the most widespread bad honey and one of the most terrible bad honey lists of all time. I mean, it's literally exactly what they named their honey after. It's literally honey and the honeycomb is made of wax. I'm not talking about anything like the honeycomb itself. I'm talking about the glue that holds the honey together.

Duane: Oh, right.

The Kree: Don't let a cat get all upprated.

WillyFive: Well, it does seem like part of the investigation is that the tabloid run by the UK tabloid WAS tabloid, so that's what they're going to be tagging for anyone taking them up on.

Tugatrix: But the gossip section is sooooo gross

~!~Why does everyone think that the greatest comedies of all time were made by the late greats?

Deleted member 1258: For number of people here in Sweden, it seems that the greats were made by the late greats. What are your go-tos?
Edit: I know that the greatest movies were made by the greats themselves, but I still find it funny to this day that I believe that those movies were made by the late greats. No, their work was fine until the mid-late 00's right? After that it was all over the place with pretty late greats, but I'm baffled that we have so many greats now.

~!~Heath Ledger: "We are not the only country that has to deal with racism."

KraftyKrankins: It's a long article with a lot of commentary and discussion surrounding it but here are some highlights:
Heath Ledger: "Heath Ledger has written several of his trilogy scripts, including the highly-criticised "Once Upon A Time in Scotland", and is currently the director of the critically acclaimed "Once Upon A Time in the Dark".
Jamie Foxx: Ledger - "A great British director, his vision is a scary and complicated vision. We are not the only country that has to deal with racism."
Others mentioned him by name, but there are other names attached to his work like Mike Leigh, Clive Owen, Martin Campbell and, of course, Mark Bosworth.
Bruce Greenwood: "He is an incredible director. He has created some of the most beautiful and complex films I have ever witnessed."
Bale: "He was a childhood dream of mine. His style is unique and stands out. Every scene he has was incredible. Some of my favorite scenes were when he was talking to two girls. He had a lot of compassion and a lot of wit. He never gave in to racism. He was a true writer. I still admire him today."
John Dowd: "He was known for his sophisticated and biting portrait of a brilliant man. I didn't think I would see myself as racist but I was raised with him in a family of thoughtful people who gave me the privilege to experience what it took to make me who I am today."
Richard Lee Tompson: "There is a lot to take in this. I’ve known him since the 70s but I have never met him. I have seen him film and television. I can say we have to "deal with it because we are dealing with racism." We need to see that there are good people out there who can do great things for what is happening and that is what good people need to do."
Laurie Metcalf: "He knows so many good things about the world. I have to say that he knows, too, so poorly. Not that he doesn’t know, but that he does not know. I have tried many times, and met many with the greatest of qualities. But he knows. He knows that we need to deal with it and to try and make it

~!~What do you think of the character Katsuki Sugita?

Squarehard: Re-watching the part 1 Part 6, you could see he's been a bit of a letdown in parts of the series, and it's not a full-fledged character, but more of a secondary character.
He's not very good, he's just a different character in a very strange way.
What do you think of him, and what about the rest of the character?
-----

Dynamite Shikoku: He's a bad guy in a funny way
-----
Airegin: I liked him but I didn't do him as a whole well. He's a little too mean and vindictive, and not too proud of his plans he can't handle being around another kid.
But he's mostly right.
-----

Cantaim: He's a dumb ass
-----
Brakke: He’s a side character that’s a good guy but a little too vindictive.
-----
Tace: He’s basically the boss of the protagonist’s character arc. What's his relation to the main series bad guy? Is it a war with the protagonist? Is it a war with the manga bad guy? Or is it a war with the anime bad guy?
-----
Airegin: His war with the protagonist is part of his character arc, and he's a bad guy in a funny way.

====================
~!~Why are people always so salty when a movie is good?

poindexter: I have a ton of salty people on my ignore list, and I've never seen anyone take me out on a salty person like that. 
In fact, the only time I've ever taken someone out was when I was drunk, and I've never had one in front of a close friend. I've never had a "friendship" - not even a drunk friend, who is super down to demand my money. 
I don't like salty people, and I don't think that's healthy. But I feel like I need to vent a bit.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Because people get super defensive about stuff that they know is going to happen regardless.
-----
A Robot: Because they don't care how salty they are.
-----
Kasai: Because people don't get bothered by criticism, and if they don't like something it's immediately assumed they aren't upset about something, and that's just weird.
-----
Cantaim: Because I absolutely hate salty people.
-----
Fulminator: Because people don't care how salty they are
-----
TheLetdown: Because people are so salty about things that they can’t help but be defensive when they feel bad about it.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Because being salty is just a sign of how poorly resourced a country is.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I don't mean that in a "you're upset" sense, I just mean that in a "that's dumb" sense.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Because people are really salty, and this doesn't surprise me at all.

~!~I had a hard time coming up with an answer for the title of this song

Dali: I'm not sure if it's the chorus at the end but it's the best part of the song. It's something about an alien invasion and the music is just so out there that it's the highlight of the video. It's also as awesome as it sounds.
I can't imagine the song making it out to be an answer that would apply to the song. I've been meaning to listen to it for a while.
-----
Cybersai: Yeah, I remember hearing this song as a kid and it's pretty catchy.
-----
DJGolfClap: I'm not sure how it stacks up to your song, but I came up with this one as a kid and thought it was a great way to get a picture of the actual song.
-----
Dali: No clue but I think I'll check it out when I get the chance.
-----
Dude Guy: It's the song with the red alien.
-----
Cybersai: Not really. I remember hearing about one of my friends' song calling her a "shadowangel", though.
-----
Dali: I think that's fair enough and I'm forgetting something.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: This is your problem. This is your song. I’m all about that.
-----
Rivenblade: I think there's a lot of context lost when you include non-English speaking people like this one.
-----
Dali: Yes, I was just thinking about it. I don't think I can program my music to sound like the aliens.

Horror.

Strelok: This is amazing

Trojita: It's called the 1996 evidence which means it also wasn't filmed in daylight or you would have seen the guards blocking the road
It's also amazing how open the windows are when these images are captured

This is a new school, and the district is no longer enforcing district policy.
-----
fluffydelusions: I’m with you, I’ve been told that schools are required by law to report students to protect students. I’m sure schools across the country follow suit.

The Albatross: That's sad for a lot of people, but hey, if she can't get home from work she'll sleep in the back, or maybe stay in the airport even if it's a very long trip.

Purpose: To defeat the "Einstein Fantastic" meme, he fused his penis with Pinkertons hair and battled against other men to win.
I'm a sucker for fan fiction, so I thought this was really awesome. I think it's gonna be super sweet and I think we might get a sequel in the future.

~!~The end of Batman '89, the year of Batman comics and the end of Batman animated movies?

SageShinigami: I'm not talking about the "end" of superhero comics and the end of animated movies, but:
When Batman '89 ended with the Justice League cartoon ending with it's final season, the year of Batman comics and the year of animated movies. The year of Batman movies. I can't believe I haven't seen either Batman '89 or The Killing Joke, and I'm going to be keeping my expectations in check.
So, Batman 89 was a year where everything was about the ending of the DCU, and the end of animated movies were all about the end of the Joker and the Birds of Prey saga, so it was "the year of the Batman". I know some people will say the year of the Fox animated movies, but I'm talking about animated films from the 90's.
The Fox-Disney merger is one of the better examples of what animated movies from the90's could have been. I think the end of Fox-DC is the best example of that moment. 
So:
What animated movie from the year of Batman 2000 from the 90's from the best and most memorable animated movie ever made "The Legend of the Ninja Turtles" from the 1990's?
And what animated movie from the year of Batman '89 from the greatest and most memorable animated film ever made "The Legend of the Sword in the Watercolors" from the 1990's from the best and most memorable animated movie known to man. 
What about the Power Rangers animated movies from the 90's?
What about the Metal Green?
What about the Gundam X?
What about you?
-----
Mediking: I mean... I guess I'm cool with that lol. I just saw them in the 90s.
-----
SageShinigami: I love them too. I mean, I guess I'm cool with that.
-----
Dook's Revenge: It's the year of the Berserk movie...

~!~Let's make Simpsons the best ever?

Thewonandonly: There are some ways this could go but I know there are a lot of hilarious scenes in the show and there is a lot of heart stopping stuff in there. I'd love some advice on how to make it the best ever though.
-----
Stinkles: Use light effects.
-----
Kevers: You can't make a comedy series around heart breaking stuff.
-----
Thewonandonly: I've seen a lot of movies and I've been burned on it. I'm just gonna say how I would have loved it.
-----
WrenchNinja: I would say the best thing to come out of the series was the Beastie Boys cartoon.
-----
Kevers: You don't think there would be some heartache involved? 
You mean a cartoon where a group of kids is bored with the show and the response of "What the hell are you doing?"
-----
thecouncil: Depressing stuff.
-----
Thewonandonly: I love that. I love that this show is so funny and serious. The scene where Bart is locked in the house with the boys is fucking awful but hey at least he's still in bed lol
-----
Frecklestein: I would love to make a comedy series called Maus while I'm in the mood for more classics.

~!~Uncle Rashaan: The Legend of Korra: The second half of a 10 year long political saga

The Gunslinger: This was an interesting read, and I thought it'd be interesting to see a discussion on the history behind it.
I'm curious as to where the fuck you got this from, what do you think it is, and what are the potential consequences.
-----
TaySan: I read the whole thing a couple months ago and was shocked to find out that this was a thing. I remember everyone from the Korra wikia was talking about it.
-----
Ithil: Power lines.
-----
Ryaaan14: They should have drawn lines in the sand and cut them as much as possible, but that’s just me
-----
The Gunslinger: Perhaps they should have drawn the lines in the sand because they were trying to draw lines in the sand...
-----
SkullHydra: They should've dragged that thing out of the George Lucas Universe, and made it into that.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: I didn't like Korra. I really liked the first half. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, and I did watch the first half, but I didn't really feel like the rest of the series was that great. I could see it being better if they tried to do some darker things with the story.
-----
LukarWuff: To me, the first half is pretty damned good, but I thought it was a bit too political with a bunch of political subplots. Like, the whole 'government is bad for us' thing was dumb, but the actual argument for it was pretty good.
-----
The Gunslinger: I know I shouldn't be surprised, that's kind of the point.
-----
Ithil: The other half was some good stuff, but it was just a bunch of political subplots. It could've been better.

~!~What's The Most Overrated Podcast in Your Area?

Andrew Korenchkin: I'll admit, I've never really listened to much over the top radio prog, so I'm not really sure where to start. I've heard a lot of prog, and I've listened to a fair bit, but not a lot. I'll give a shoutout to Bob Marley's stuff, though. Not my jam though, but it's definitely on my list.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Probably Dr. Caro.
-----
whitehawk: I'm a fan of NPR Music and Radiohead.
But I don't listen to many of their old music.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I'm gonna go with Bob Marley's stuff.
Nothing of his I've heard so far.
-----
Kirblar: Probably Dr. Caro. I've heard a couple of his older songs on the BBC playlists.
-----
Eatin' Olives: Bob Marley's stuff.
edit: Oh shit, I forgot about this. I may have to check out this thread again.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Bob Marley?

~!~"The Town" - Netflix Feb. 14, 2018

WaffleTaco: Anyone watch this? I know I am a bit of a Ready Player One fan and while I enjoyed the first two seasons I thought they were more episodic episodes. 
Any other people who are in for this?
-----
StuBurns: I watched it in the theater. It was okay. I didn't enjoy it.
-----
WaffleTaco: I actually saw the show in the theater. I thought it was a good show. I don't know how much it sucked, but I thought it was good. 
I didn't like the ending. I thought it was a bad way to start the show.
-----
Wag: I was way too young to really enjoy anything except the initial two seasons. I think Netflix just doesn't have it in it.
-----
AoM: It's like a TV show version of the Cheers episode.
-----
AoM: The movie in 4K.
-----
Wag: I hope all those kids in the Cabaret were in on this. Good shit.
-----
Moppeh: It's not really a sequel to the movie.
-----
WaffleTaco: I think people just saw it in the theater and didn’t see the movie afterwards?
-----
Kas: I watched the movie in front of a live audience (kids) and they were laughing all the way to the chair. It was not funny.

~!~Amazon’s £9bn HQ in Burnaby, British Columbia seeks to accommodate 15,000 jobs

RastaMentality: This is really just a mess of supply chain problems when the more expensive one has an even worse selection. For example, the Victoria and Albert Eaves gift shops are the only two locations open to customers in the Burnaby cluster.
-----
DGenerator: I mean, it's Burnaby. Don't make fun of this one, Vancouver's housing crunch is ruining everything.
-----
Blueblur: This is a terrible thing. I'm beginning to think the only reason the city is still in Burnaby is to keep the promise of being a place of culture.
-----
RastaMentality: I mean, it’s the Vancouver of Burnaby. Don’t make fun of this one, Vancouver's housing crunch is ruining everything.
-----
Sectorseven: Burnaby is pretty big.
-----
RastaMentality: It’s just a mess of supply chain problems. It’s not considered a city but more of a clusterfuck with no traffic. There’s a lot of job losses and the city just can’t handle more.
-----
Blueblur: I'd say it's a clusterfuck, but I didn't know it was that bad.
-----
RastaMentality: It’s just a mess with supply chain problems. It’s not considered a city but more of a clusterfuck with no traffic. There’s a lot of job losses and the city just can’t handle more.
-----
Hjod: I'm guessing Burnaby isn't Vancouver? And I'm guessing there's a lot of people who live in the city.
-----
RastaMentality: Also Vancouver has a population of over 60k and a population that's growing faster than Toronto and every other big city in Canada.

====================
~!~Do you believe that free speech advocates are on some level espousing right wing views?

brainchild: This is a big one. I've seen a lot of people make the argument that "right to fight" proponents are on some level simply just digitally pencilling. The idea that people are on some level just digitally pencilling "free speech" as a defense is a common argument for defense of rightwingers, and that is patently ridiculous. I'm not defending rightwingers, I'm just suggesting that rightwingers do have right wing views.
The best example I can think of is when conservative "rational" anthropologist David Ray Ray Winick espouses a "procedure" that reduces people in his work to a job, group of people that have no job, and the entire society is ruled by suprmely because we're too clever and "rational" for the task. It's like saying that the society is designed for right wing persons.
I think it's a more reasonable response to the idea that people are on some level simply pencilling "free speech" as a defense of right-wing ideologies. I think this is incredibly unjustified on the basis on the proposal that there is a right wing defender who are not responsible for the marginalized groups that they supposedly defend. I think this is a case of "hypothetical thinking", because the right wing defender is actually advocating the oppression of everyone else.
Do you believe that right wingers are on some level just pencilling "free speech"?
-----
Powdered Egg: Absolutely.
-----
shnurgleton: No, they are just pencilling creatively
-----
Aurongel: I don't believe there are right-wing proponents of any kind of right-wing ideology.
-----
Mindwipe: I think the right-wing theorists are pretty bad at discrediting anything, so I'd rather have them on my list.
-----
Zoc: No. They’re mostly just pencilling with meaningless magical assertions that are meaningless unless proven to be true.
-----
Slayven: The right have always been about regressive, nationalist policies that marginalize dissent and marginalize ideas. They are completely fine with white supremacists and their "free speech" talking, but they are just dressing up their formerly racist ideology as a defense of white people.

Septimus Prime: Cold it.

JCHandsom: Cold it
-----
Griselbrand: Cold it until it liquates. Then put it in a closed container and eat it.
-----

Praxis: Cold it with a scoop of vanilla ice.

It's delicious, but I'm a sucker for frozen/ frozen stuff.

~!~"The Dark Knight Rises" is the better Batman movie

Bor Gullet: I enjoyed TDKR, which is a good point. It was a fun adventure with a great third act.
-----
Fat4all: nah, that was pretty dark knight parody
-----
SigmasonicX: The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie, but I think Nolan nailed TDK.
-----
UnpopularBlargh: I like it but I dislike TDKR.
-----
Fat4all: nah i’m not saying that, but i would say the Dark Knight trilogy is better than Knight todays Disney-Fox collaboration
-----
HStallion: I really liked how it was the more action filled film and the action-packed film. The Dark Knight Rises is the most fun I've been in a Batman film in a long time.
-----
Bor Gullet: I don't think Nolan had it right. It was a fun film, but I think he nailed it.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I like it a lot, and I think I prefer it to the highly reviewed, more action filled Dark Knight.
-----
Moff: I think I prefer it to TDK, but that's just my opinion.

====================
~!~Aliens vs. Machine Gunmen

Cryptosporidium: This is something I have been pondering about for a while. A fight between machines that are more lethal than humans. I have no idea why they are even mentioned in the title of the movie.
The machines are:
- machines with special weapons
- machines that can do mind control
- machines that are invisible
- machines that have special powers that aren't always invisible
There is a lot of controversy over these types of machines in the 2000's. Laser weapons are extremely popular in the movie Aliens.
The machines that is the main character in the Aliens is a man named William H. Gibson.
He had a very large ego and very strong support of his mission.
The man behind these weapons is a man named Franz Kafka who is the main character of the film
The film has a discussion between Bauer and H.K.
"So the machine will not kill us or take us from our natural destiny. It will take us from the natural destiny and then at the very last blows our noses in part because our natural destiny is becoming increasingly unattainable. The machine will take us from the natural destiny of the world to another world."
It is interesting that their general objective is to take us from our natural destiny to another world. We are not going to have a destiny to become brothers or sisters with machines.
The machines that are presented are:
- Men
- Women
- children
- Guns
- The most common goal of these machines are to take us from the natural destiny of the world.
It is important to note that the machines that are presented are not only invisible but also non-magical. Most of these machines are non-magical humans.
I am not going to go into detail about the reasons that this film presents humans as being the "natural" masters of the universe. I will provide a synopsis later.
Spoiler: Ending
Let's not forget that Mr. Freeze in the original scenario is the chosen one and the one we all know and love. He is the master of this universe.
Spoiler: Movie ends
-----
Conkersbadfurday: I like the idea that these weapons could kill us, but that they wouldn't necessarily be invisible and also that the machines themselves could do something about our nonmagical minds being underpowered. I think this film's ending may be the most up to date.

~!~What Are You Reading? (March 2018)

ara: Yay, another month off. Reads interesting and engaging.
March is a good month for books, as it allows for a lot of reading and reading to occur at the same time throughout the week. I don't read much anymore so I'm trying to figure out if I'm just going to be reading all day on my bed any day now or when I'm sleeping more than 2 hours.
Anyway, back to the topic main focus, what are you reading? March is a good month for books as it allows for a lot of interesting discussions.
I'm reading "The Way Out of Dark Dreams" by Fr. Keith Richards and Michail Benmueller, both available on Amazon. The story follows a group of people living in a remote island and they are among the first to encounter a dark past, The Light in the Darkness, and The Stand. Both are collected in The Way Out of Dark Dreams.
I'm also reading "The Catcher of Gomorrah" by Henry James Barlow and Anne Garrel Frye.
What are you reading?
March is a good month for books. I haven't read much so I'm trying to figure out if I'm just getting riled up or if I'm just doing something I'm trying to put on the go.
-----
Redcrayon: I'm reading the book "The Spoils of War" by Neil Gaiman and it feels like a reread. It's Gaiman's short story about a young dwarf who goes into war and captures his brother, but then finds out he's a vampire, so the book is Gaiman's take on the "myth" that the "truth" behind dwarf lore is correct.
I'm gonna read "The Stand" by Y.A. Ellis, it's just a nice little read. I'm not sure if I want to continue reading it because I don't know how good it is, but I'll try.
-----
Redcrayon: Yup. I'll be reading "Worlds" by Neil Gaiman and I'm enjoying it. It's an Ellis style story about a bunch of weird little stories that happen to gradually reveal some pretty spectacular twist bits.
-----
RatskyWatsky: I'll be reading "The Stand" by Daniel Clowell and will probably finish "The Girl in the Machine

janusff: I'm talking about things like:
-The best in-depth stories and analysis of movies that don't get talked about enough.
-Anime, movie, books, tv, comics, etc.
-Anime recommendations from outlets like IndieWire, THR, etc.
What say you Era? Which ones do you enjoy?
-----
SillyEskimo: I love the Giant Robo one.

Tence: I love the Happily Everlast one.

Kevers: The one where the alien was in a pog form in space.
Also The Last Jedi and the one where the robot was in a pog.
-----
The Almighty Tria: One of my favorite podcasts
-----
B.K.: The one where the little girl and her pug came together to beat the perpetually angry bird.
-----
Truly Gargantuan: The one where the raptors ate a bunch of human pugs.
-----
Protome: The one where they breed and kill half the humans while the other half bumblebee and vultures and raptors and all that.
-----
Unicorn: The one where Jabba appeared in the very first shot of Episode III in the New Frontier.

SigmasonicX: Short, sweet Panoramas, as in Panoramas + Star Wars

~!~The online outrage over the Netflix Daredevil trailer was a good thing

Mage_of_Cinder: I know that the public outrage over the Netflix Daredevil trailer was a good thing, but was a bad thing?
I watched all of it and it's honestly amazing how much it affected people. I don't think I've ever been so emotional when watching a trailer in front of a live audience.
-----
RoboPlato: I'm so ready for it to make it big. It's amazing how Netflix has managed to make a movie out of a major Netflix series.
-----
Moppeh: This is worth the hype.
-----
SigmasonicX: I'm so ready. I remember the first time I watched the Daredevil trailer, I was like, "That's basic enough! How can you go about doing this?"
-----
Dennis8K: Is the shitstorm of the Internet just starting to wear off before it gets here?
-----
brokeastronaut: Always wanted to see it, but I don't know if I would actually.

~!~Why can't we get this whole Kryptonite from Kryptonite?

John Doe: This was one of the last threads that I made and I really wanted to make a thread about this and bring it up in a nice light. It sounds like the whole point of the show is that the show is about the struggle of a guy who gets Kryptonite from Kryptonite, it's not just a battle between good and evil.
-----
Transistor: Oh, you mean people actually got their hands on Kryptonite?
-----
Krejlooc: I feel like this is what I would call a semi-portable alternative.
-----
John Doe: I figure it's a bit of a stretch to say that this is a defense against the internet because you'd probably be attacked for it.
-----
Mister Saturn: I think a lot of people are just ignorant to the show and would likely not have access to it if they didn't.
I mean, it's not directly a Kryptonite flavour, this is the actual actual "natural" version.
-----
Krejlooc: Well at least you're not talking about B-Dubs, that's for sure.
-----
Chrno: Not really a defense.
-----
Aselith: I've seen people say it's just a marketing thing. Guess I have to watch the show, I'll give you that.
-----
Transistor: Oh yeah, the show is about the struggle between good and evil.
-----
Krejlooc: It's not just the good, it's all the darkness that fuels it.

~!~How do I find a good online community thread/discussion pool?

WarpSpeedMolasses: Title sounds dumb but I’m genuinely curious as to how people here on Era respond to threads or threads that are made.
I’m asking for a general idea of what I can do to establish a good community thread-marksword style, but I’m also looking to see if there’s a leaderboard or a more specific feature that I should implement. I’d like to keep it as chronological order as possible, and don’t want to lose the chronological nature of the thread.
So, Era, how do I attract people to this thread?

SolVanderlyn: I thought this was a pretty interesting thread.

Ithil: The voice actors in old cartoons are terrible.

SolVanderlyn: These things are always lame.
-----

ElectricBlanketFire: Not every story needs a new protagonist, so I'm not sure how.

NewDonkStrong: The best things in cartoons are jokes.

~!~How do you deal with "cannibal" vs "freakilist"?

CannonFodder52: In case you haven't seen it, I'm having a party tonight with some friends and we plan to have a "cannibal dinner" for the day. We don't plan to have any hangovers after eating and drinking, but we do plan to try some "cannibal" or "frozen sliders" if we can.
I'd like to know what foods you eat that are leftovers for the day and what foods you freestyle when you eat them.
Also, how do you make them?
-----
KHarvey16: I would normally bring a bottle of frozen sardines (sang corned beef or lean ground beef) with me.
-----
Mr. X: Sardines or dried boneless skin?

CannonFodder52: Just depends on the place. I'll bring a burger or two.
I don't think I would waste a bottle of frozen sardines unless I had to.
-----
Mr. X: Sardines
-----
TheBaldEmperor: Sardines. I don't know about the steaks, but I would take beef jerky. If I can get it, sure.
-----
Alethiometer: I bring a cooking pot full of ingredients, lots of food, lots of water.
-----
faint: I give away my cooking pot to my friends or my family.
-----
CannonFodder52: I would bring a bbq or some food with me.
-----
Mr. X: Beef jerky, frozen sliders or steak. It's not "sasting" my food but it's "finally" frozen.

Irnbru: I love London, it’s huge and nice, even though I do hate it a little at times. 
For me it’s gotta be the 5 Boroughs, which are to say Manchester, Liverpool, and so on. 
I don’t want to live in a place that will be bombed by Brexit. 
I just want to visit London first, then visit other big cities. 
I’m in my twenties and I think I want to visit Scotland first, then some countryside and then the country that's next?

Irnbru: How old are you?

TheBeardedOne: I'm from Canada. I've been to the UK and visited Scotland, which is interesting, since I've always wanted to visit the EastEndais.

TheBeardedOne: Reading a lot about the EastEndais, I looked for something like "How do you guys know that?"

TheBeardedOne: Also I'd imagine that you're in the wrong.

~!~The best way to prepare for a legal dispute in America?

1000 Need A Peace Of Mind
We are a small and small GAF group, but of course we aren't big news. We're not a site that's for everyone, like most news sites are, but for certain topics we skew our coverage around.
So I figure we could all help each other out, if asked for help I'd like to start with a Google Forms PW calculator. But since the time that I've been in the small business community (which I get to do as a thank you!) this thing won't even be a thing. So I know I'm going to be a bit late on this. I think I have to start somewhere, but I'm tired of wasting time trying to figure out how to play this out. I have business cards that I took for granted just because weed ensures I won't have to admit to myself something I shouldn't.
There are a few ways I know what it feels like to admit that I fucked up; I'd prefer to have a real life legal dispute resolved by real legal means, but that's just me. My plan is to be patient, get help, and then make up the difference so I don't get jumped by my own insurance. I feel like I'm only the second person in the world to have this issue, after all. It's not really an issue of "I fucked up big time." It's a problem of ego. 
What are the best way to go about solving this problem for me? I'm out of ideas here long, but a lot of the resources I tried out are for big companies. Family trusts, etc? Is a joint venture of companies? Is it really legal? I'm using PayPal, but have a bank account with PayPal, and my financial info is in a joint account with a company. I'd love help on this as well, or at the very least get some state sponsored help with a joint account for this problem.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: Just a little don’t tell your family and you’ll have a small debt to pay to cover this and all the other bullshit.
-----
MIMIC: I am a small business owner. I work in a very small business.
I'm sorry if this is a thread for you. I am not qualified to speak on your behalf.
I understand you are trying to resolve

~!~Is a "black and white" website the best option when it comes to online services?

Kismet: I was thinking about using a service like WeChat, but I'm curious as to which type of service you can best use.
WeChat uses QR code to scan your order to identify people who order from WeChat and then drops your scan to the WeChat. I use it to identify potential recruiters/haves by scanning.
You can use the QR code to sign up for a room or get a room at a restaurant (if there is one in the area I'm not going to, I'll scan ahead looking for a table) and then you can say "Order" from there.
The only downside is that I've never been able to connect to real authentic restaurants.
-----
Bigkrev: I just discovered this site over the past few days and I've been using it for several years.
-----
ZackieChan: I'm a frequent traveler so I use the online chat feature to remind people where they are.
-----
Kismet: You're going to be a little late to the party lol. I'm on mobile so I can't post too much, but I'll give you the hint: In the Philippines, if you're visiting for the first time, Be patient.
-----
kiguel182: I'm assuming you are American and have no history with online services. I know two Filipino people who use online services and both said they use them.
-----
Kismet: Yeah, I'm not American but my wife has a Filipino husband who uses WeChat and she uses the Wifi equivalent of that around the Philippines. It's such a painless, instant way of communicating method.
-----
The Albatross: I use Skype for work and it's been working quite well for me, as I communicate with everyone on the phone, and I also don't have a work phone.
-----
Kismet: I just realized how funny that part of the above post is.
-----
Kung Fu: Skype for Work?

~!~New CRISPR technology advances without FDA approval

ReactionShot: Source: The Guardian
-----
Kraken3dfx: CRISPR/Gene Recycling tech is getting closer and closer to being practical.
-----
yumms: Science has been shit on CRISPR for decades.
-----
Sectorseven: FDA needs to be on the come up with a standard for CRISPR so that it can be FDA approved.
-----
Dennis8K: In the USA, this is the most advanced possible form of DNA we will ever see.
-----
Dekim: CRISPR will never replace the human body. With that said, I'm still hopeful.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Well the FDA is saying that they need to be 100% FDA-wide and will have to approve using other types of DNA (like fingerprints) to find out new methods of cancer treatment. That would mean using the FDA-wide rules and guidelines on CRISPR today, but then I don't think it would be a very big leap at the time to be able to use a CRISPR technique today.
-----
Ether_Snake: FDA approval rules need to be a standard, and approval by the public, like most things today, could be decades away.
-----
Laser Man: This is a big step for cancer research in the future. Before, it was just going to be a one and done type of thing. Now, it's science.
-----
Ether_Snake: So let's say it works, FDA needs to close the door on it.

~!~Nostalgia is dead.

Deleted member 36937: This is actually old news, I thought it was bound to come out anytime ago.
I was born in 1988 and I grew up in the 90s. I watched the 90s all over again. My birthday is still celebrated, I still hear about it every year, I still go to the movie pubs still.
So I thought it would be interesting to create a thread where we can relive great moments from the decades of Nostalgia that still evokes fond memories today.
I'll invite all of us to post the best Nostalgia Moments we thought we already saw, preferably in our childhood.
PLEASE NO MEMES.
-----
NESpowerhouse: I still remember the first time I saw the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime. I was so hyped and they used the anime in a ridiculous way.
-----
Deleted member 36937: NO.
-----
sphagnum: The only thing Nostalgia is going to do right now is remind people of the 80s all the time.
-----
The Almighty Tria: That's what I was told when Nostalgia was a viable concept, is that it was the first thing the Nostalgia section of the internet actually got right.
-----
Goldenroad: No, it's just a good nostalgic moment. Nostalgia is just that, a good nostalgic moment. Nostalgia is a type of nostalgia, and it has no place in the internet culture.
-----
jediyoshi: I still remember the 90s.
-----
ResetGreyWolf: Why isn't there the NES in the 90s?
-----
Deleted member 36937: My guess is that it was a "non-gaming" trend that became more prevalent in the 2000's. Nostalgia is pretty redundant, and it's going to be hard to find specific Nostalgia that will serve as a non-issue in any future future effort at reviving internet culture.
-----
Spork4000: It's not that they don't have Nostalgia sections in any other digital era, it's that Nostalgia catalog has been so small and that's keeps getting larger and bigger. It's not huge in the last ten years and it's not that it's always relevant.

Cocolina: Amazon
-----
Acorn: Amazon
-----
PJV3: I could use the bag but I don't care?
-----

Dishwalla: eBooks
-----
Mechaplum: I'm guessing this will be to make sure that kind of bag doesn't happen in the future.
-----
pulsemyne: I want to read through my book but it is so hard to justify having a digital copy when I don't need to use it.
-----
DrSlek: I think I'll just open it all up in my tablet and read it with it.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I'm sure the US is going to make a similar ruling, I dunno, but the EU will soon start a process to get rid of digital receipts as well.

~!~Why does nobody here on Era talk about how awesome ResetERA is?

Jintor: I came across this on a search and I'm genuinely baffled.
Is it because I'm not a Grave Robber, but because I'm a millennial and I'm looking for a worthy explanation?
-----
Kthulhu: Because it's a "community" that's run by "me" and "edgelords".
Someone told me that a forum where I could talk about my depression and I wouldn't have that.
-----
Sectorseven: Why do you have a thread about it?
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: It's for the community. I don't have a thread

Jintor: Thank you. I just posted in there and thought it was funny

Piecake: 
-----
TheBeardedOne: Good for NYC. I hope this gets more people to vote.

DonShula: That seems a fair deal.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I can’t see a single thing bad happening to the people of NYC...
-----
maxxpower: What does $1.6 billion reduce?
-----
SteveWinwood: good for them i guess?
-----
TheBeardedOne: Good for them. I'm sure more will be done, but not as much as I'm thinking, and I'm not sure that it'll help.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Good for them, because it's a lot more than just 1.6 billion dollars. It's a lot more than half a billion, because that's the amount the city has spent on new council, new developments, new parks, transit, social services, etc.
-----
TI92: Shit it's like 5% of the gross for the city
-----
Dennis8K: Huh, so I don't get it, but this is actually a good idea.

~!~Is there a better show to watch on a work night than 30 Minute History of Geoghether.

whitehawk: I just finished watching 30 Minute History of Geoghether. It was pretty boring so far, but I guess I just want to make sure that it is better than what we got. I'm trying to find two shows that I can watch on a work night (I think we are going to go with Zendaya, but I'm not sure).
I'm thinking of also watching the first seasons of Game of Thrones (maybe the seasons as a whole).
So is there anything else?
-----
whitehawk: I guess I'd say try Stranger Things.
-----
whitehawk: I know there's Zendaya, but I'm not sure if it's the best option. I think it's Netflix's sci-fi service.
-----
whitehawk: I'd actually say not sure what you're looking for.
-----
whitehawk: I don't know, maybe I just want to watch shows on a work night?
-----
Tesseract: maybe try Stranger Things?
-----
whitehawk: That might be a mistake, but I can't think of anything other than that I'd like to try.
-----
whitehawk: I'm not sure I'd want to watch it on a work night.
-----
whitehawk: I'm thinking maybe Zendaya because it's available for streaming.
-----
whitehawk: This is a good idea. I'd like to try Stranger Things, but I think the Netflix version is less experience than the "Netflix" version, and is more of a work night nightmare nightmare.
-----

====================
~!~What's the best way to watch Star Wars: The Last Jedi Blu-ray?

Rivenblade: I've been on a Star Wars binge lately, and I've finally decided to give it a watch. I'm completely on the cusp of watching something from the directors - it's so good, and it's a complete and total cinematic universe. I need to get on the Blu-ray sometime, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to do so in the meantime.
There's nothing in there I like more than the extended cut scenes. I'm not really sure how it ties into the larger series, but I like them.
This is the stuff that happens in the first three movies, not some extended cut scenes.
-----

====================
~!~Any public policy professionals here?

Helio: So I am an open officer in a field with a lot of private and public policy professionals. I am currently part of the team that does the Census project (which is quite large).
I am currently doing a 2 year project (the data collection period to assess census coverage was about 6 years). The data collection was done in 2016, and the results were done in 2015.
I was wondering if anyone here has done any public policy or public service work before?
-----
Helio: I did train for a year honestly, but stopped after the election. I do still work on the Census issue now. I am not doing any political work.

Firemind: No, the original Queen Queen is still around. She's smart, she's good at logic, and she's not whiny.
-----
Poppy: i mean when i was a kid we had the royals as a side project and that was literally the nightmare imo
-----
CormoranStrike: That's a title for a classic.

-----
FireSafetyBear: Yes, he’s very brief.
-----
Aurongel: I'd imagine it's closer to like... thirty minutes.

WarLox: Can't believe I'm watching this in a theater instead of going to see it in a cinema.

~!~Why Is the Spanish Civil War Still Studied In Movies?

TheGamingNewsGuy: I was watching a documentary about the Spanish Civil War and i came across this video of the Spanish Civil War. Before i go any further i ask you, What is the point of the Spanish Civil War in movies? It is basically a doomsday cult type scenario. The Spanish Civil War is still studied because of the kings and their support of Mercado, the revolutionary party that is based in Acuer de Asón. The Spanish military has a lot of issues with the military dictatorship but they do have a military leader that is actually not a total war criminal. 
It is interesting to hear some of the details about the Spanish Civil War and how it may have played a role in the current times. Is the Spanish Government in good shape at all? Does it benefit them at all? Discuss all questions in the telegram.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I'm wondering if the Spanish military really needs to be studied or if it is only in for very short term scenarios.
-----
Shugga: I think the Spanish civil war is just one of the stupidest shit ever.
Its not that they aren't fighting in their own self made cause, that's just the way king cain said it is.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: It's not just the point in the Spanish civil war, the Spanish military was much better than the English at that.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes the Spanish military was fighting a self inflicted war.
-----

TheGamingNewsGuy: Also i am curious to hear if the Spanish military actually believes in its independence or if it's just some elaborate scam.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah the Spanish military was fighting the British when Spanish powers were at their most advantageous in the late 1608's.
-----
Qikz: The Spanish military was fighting a war but they were also fighting a war because they were not under the control of the king at that point. They were able to create an independant country after the war in one fell swoop.
-----
Queen Kong: I'm not sure the Spanish Civil War is worth studying because it is just a stupid war that is won by cain.

~!~[Poll] If Democrats take the House this fall, what do things have to be done to protect core Democratic values?

brainchild: In this hypothetical, which of the following are the most important?
1. Fighting Trump's fascism
2. Fighting Brexit's bullshit
3. Fighting the evils that are perpetrated against Americans, like Russian meddling in the US elections
I personally think 1 is the most important. I don't believe in a Democratic Party that pushes all the while pushing Democrats further far left, but if this becomes reality, what do you think is the most important? For the record, would you also want to talk about these things?
2. A good education system. For the sake of my own self-esteem, I'm going with 2.
3. 2 is trying to stop the spread of misinformation and propaganda, but he's not the only option.
4. 2 is trying to end the spread of fake news, but he's not the only option.
Edit:
For 2, the most pressing issue that I have to face in the near future: the worsening of the ongoing alt-right crisis, and the spread of the Russian propaganda.
-----
Switch Back 9: 2 is the only answer.
-----
Caleb187: If the Democrats take the House this fall I'd say 2 at this point. I'd just like to see em go down as a possible reality and trump's worst enemy.
-----
Xe4: 2 is the most obvious first choice, but I'd guess the second option is 1, so 1.
-----
Dr. Benton Quest: 2?
-----
Dark Knight: I think the 2nd option is yes. I've thought about it, I don't really know what it actually is or why it's even even 2 at all.
-----
Rover: 2 really, really hard to answer for any one party. It's hard to even think about what something is and think about what it is and how it's actually that good.
-----
Dark Knight: Correction, I'd say a good education system
-----
Punished Snaku: 2nd option is yes.
-----
brainchild: I would love to see the House take action on this, but I don't really know how to make that happen.

Nacho Papi: Think it's probably a dark theme for comments.
But it could be an awful theme if you have time it would be cool too.
-----
Mendrox: Comments.

shnurgleton: This thread would be awesome

TheBeardedOne: No

TheBeardedOne: I don't think it's dark, I think it's just a dark theme.

-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't know what this thread is, I've only seen them described as "dark themes"
-----
TheBeardedOne: Yeah, I can't see it. They're just dark.

Mr Swine: I’ve been thinking about trying a few things out for a hobby I really enjoy. My first would be WindWord and it’s basically a bunch of free legal texts to a bunch of people who are good at what they do.
I’ve read some of the stuff I think I would like to read but don’t want to read any more than the few things I read from the main character. I’ve read some of the stuff I would like to read but don’t want to read anymore. Is there a good service that I should read all the texts from? I want to be able to click the links and they’ll play through to something I read again.
-----
Doctor_Thomas: There are some good resources at the moment. There's some great UK sites, there's a bunch of UK based sites that are worth a look.
-----
Mr Swine: I just read the stuff I want to read, thanks!
-----
PROh1bited: I would like to read a little bit of the UK law journals (I.e. the conclusions of RDA-21) and then archive that to a random site where I can read it in my phone, laptop or tablet.
-----
PrimeBeef: I read a lot of random stuff. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm a lawyer.
-----
TaterTots: I read a lot of random things too. I read the very first part of a book that I've read a bunch of times. Mostly random stuff about the Holocaust and shit like that. I'd like to read more though like the first few chapters of a novel.
-----
Mr Swine: Thanks! I just read the first part of my last book and I’ll be sure to read more. I’ll keep reading, I’ll have to read it a lot, but I’ve got a ton of books I’ll like to read and I’ve got a bunch I’ll want to read again.

Merv: I read a lot, but I don't have a lot of money to buy books.

~!~How much do you spend on phone care?

fluffydelusions: I’m curious if anybody here spends too much on phone care. I’ve had a total of 4.5 days of phone call center just for the hell of it.
-----
oreomunsta: I spend like 4-5% usually, that's what I'm told.
-----
eZn: Around 8-9% usually, I don't try too much.
-----
CrankyJay: Around 80% usually.
-----
Fat4all: I usually just get a hold on it and take it to the bank, pay it in full, then return the phone and have it in a day.
-----
Cochese: About 20% usually, usually gets returned to me if I don't get it back.
-----
maxxpower: 70-85% usually, I get them back the next day and they keep going.
-----
CrankyJay: Same. My next phone is the following phone:

Bobo Dakes: About 9% usually. The phones I buy have a lot of problems.

~!~How do you deal with awkwardness and failure in relationships?

Coraline Jones: I feel that I am unbelievably outgoing and have a good sense of humor. I have a good sense of humor when it comes to people.
I feel that I'm not as "busy" as I used to be, and I've found that if I take time to sit down and formulate a response to a situation, I get to enjoy it, if it doesn't go badly enough it ruins the next scene in my life.
I think about work, my job requires a certain amount of dedication, and I often find myself wondering "why is everyone busy 'oping out' me?"
How do you deal with failure and awkwardness?
-----
shnurgleton: I try to not get over it.
-----
Seesaw15: “Who told you that?"
-----
TheBeardedOne: A really great way to answer this is to just not talk about it.
-----
subpar spatula: I'm very good at dealing with it. People will try to bring up things they know are going to get brought up. It's all fun to me when I get something that's been bugging me for years and it finally sticks. Of course, I'm not in control of my emotions but it's fun to think about.
-----
Idolvo: Always nice to meet people when the circumstances are right.
-----
CormoranStrike: I feel that way. If I don't have any friends to hang around with I don't go. If I've got a girlfriend I'm not bothered by it.
-----
johan: I'm usually very good at dealing with failure - I don't bring it up often, but (on occasion) I get it.
-----
hobblygobbly: This, as well as the awkwardness of discussing it with people I know.
-----
CormoranStrike: I think I just enjoy the attention.

~!~What's the best way to watch Krypton TV show?

Purple Mug: So I'm not going to go to a lot of cons, I'm just looking for some suggestions. I'm more of a DC guy but I have a soft spot for more gritty stuff, like Legends of Tomorrow. But I don't see how that can make for a good watch. I can only think of Homecoming, Doctor Who, and Doctor Who at the moment.
-----
Quick: I'd recommend:
Still Zack Snyder's Batman
The Wire
The Originals
-----
TheSkullPrince: I've heard of the Wire but could never get into the original CW stuff.
The show also has a great spin off, The Gifted is a great one too.
-----
Filipus: Arthur Christmas
-----
Quick: That's not really my question, but I think it'd be great for people who have watched the CW shows. 
The Gifted is a good one too. 
As for The Gifted I think it's definitely a way better show than the original.
-----
DarkLordMalik: The Gifted is a great one too.
-----
Khanimus: Ozark
-----
Dalek: I think The Gifted is the best. It's a good one for the most common shows.
-----
Quick: I just want to add: I think Return of Zaeed could be watched quite well as a CW show.
-----
carlsojo: I would watch Death in the Family if you don't mind the non-CW stuff.

~!~Best way to install Linux on a PC?

Thisman: I want to have a PC that I can access from the internet. I have the windows 10 license and the Ubuntu Bud app installed but I don’t want to turn it on manually without going through the install process.
-----
rosetherosiest: I'd be happy to go that route, but I just don't know how much privacy it takes me to boot up the Ubuntu installer.
-----
Shugga: BIOS screen.
Or I guess boot to another computer.
-----
NSA: I always use the UEFI option on my UEFI ssd.
Take care of your BIOS.
edit:
-----
Thisman: I have UEFI?
-----
Thisman: That would be ideal but I don’t want to do that.
-----
Lkr: Probably a Phillips machine
Einstein light in the background..
-----
BronsonLee: If you can’t afford to buy one you should buy a hard drive
-----
samthebreadman: That seems like a great idea! I will sub to Kottanar.org if you want a pc version of the UEFI keyboard.
-----
jcs: I went with the free, Linux beta of UEFI boot drive management. It looks like a nice and convenient way to boot into UEFI without having to mess with the BIOS.

~!~How much do you spend on espresso?

M52B28: I'm trying to get some more money out of buying a drip-cut espresso machine. 
We already have a cheap, brand new machine that we'll likely replace every couple of months.
I'm thinking of going with something like a Coffey or Evernote, but I'm not 100% sold on either.
I don't know if there are any good drip machines that would suit everyone's needs. 
I want to be able to drink a decent amount of espresso (no, a normal Drresso is not good enough) without having to buy a machine that's either not good quality (which is kind of the point of this thread), or isn't a good replacement (which is kind of the point of this thread).
We also live in a country where it's not really a thing anymore, and that changes with the times, so I'm thinking of buying a drip-cut if that makes sense.
-----
FernandoRocker: I don't know about the best. I just want a machine that has good quality.
But I don't know about the best.
-----
DrFunk: 8 - 0
-----
M52B28: My issue is that I really want to drink milk, and I don't really like the taste of coffee.
We're both getting married in a few months, so I'm looking at those drip cuts.
-----
FernandoRocker: I'm not lactose intolerant, but I just find it overwhelming when talking about coffee.
-----
Slappy White: I drink a liter every morning. Then a couple of cups. Then about 1 cup. Then another cup. Then another cup. 
The coffee has a lot of flavor and it’s delicious, but I just try to drink as much as I can.
-----
Dishwalla: depends. between coffee, milk, and sugar.
-----
FernandoRocker: But you only drink 1 or 2. 
I tried some coffee and tried some milk. The coffee didn't taste as good. The coffee didn't have as many calories. The coffee just felt so much better than any of the other stuff I tried.
-----
Dishwalla: not as good as a regular latte, but it is delicious.

~!~Would you kill your parents if they could? (Spoilers, duh)

SugarNoodles: I’m not even sure if the discussion of killing your parents ever had the best intentions of killing them. They were a blessing to the rest of your family and I’m not even at the point in my life where I think I’d be in danger of being an animal forsworn into a job I would love. I think I would be happier if I could.
I’m talking about a story where I have to watch two movies at any given moment while I suffer a terminal illness. It’s not that I’m going to kill them, I just don’t see myself going through with it any day. I have no real reason to, I’m just not that forward. I get around this by not having to deal with my mom.
I’m not even considering murdering them. I’m just not that patient with it at this point. I’m not in a position to make decisions about someone else’s mental state and I’m not so big on the details.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'd be okay with them being gone for a long time, if they were still alive. My parents were very important to me. I don't know if I'd do it, but I'd definitely do it.
I've never done it, but I'm not really sure.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I wouldn't kill them. I'd be okay with them not being gone.
-----
Dook's Revenge: I wouldn't, but I'm not really a pickle.
-----
Ravelle: I would kill them and take their shit back.
-----
Mulciber: No. I would kill them.
-----
Klois: my parents would be ok with me
-----
Sunster: No. I would kill them, but wouldn't kill them.
-----
Spenny: I would kill them. I’m not really into shipping, I’m an introvert so I’m not gonna die over stuff like that. I’ll just be sad all the time.

TheDutchSlayer: I'm sitting here watching the end of a very tense tv drama about a young (18) accused hacker - the subject seems to be on the nature of possbble charges of rape. I feel like this show is on a higher level than the others but I wouldn't put it on the same level as this. Also I have no idea what to expect. 
What does Era think?
-----
NoirLamia: The show is very good and a horror movie is good to horror. It's a comedy.
-----
Nikus: I don't know. I watched a lot of it when it was airing and that was a while ago. There were two stand out things I liked, the comedy and the horror.
It's not a horror movie, but it's a comedy.
The horror was not a horror movie, but it's a horror movie.
-----
Knight613: The comedy is good, the horror is a horror movie in the sense that it's literally about a girl going through a lot of abuse and she's not sure she's going to be a victim.
The show is good, but I can't really get into it unless I'm watching it blind.
-----
DrewFu: It's a comedy.
-----
TheDutchSlayer: I dont watch tv on tv to much but I do have a Netflix subscription.
-----
noirlion: The comedy is great, the horror is a horror movie.

Einchy: The show is a comedy.

I am an atheist while Muslim, but I am an atheist too and I'm convinced this is a political issue that almost affects people and that government is a sham because people's faith prevents them from being honest to the government.

You're reminded that it's something you've had for a while, and that you're reminded that it's something you've had for a long time. But, then suddenly, that "once in a while" does not exist. What the fuck is this is? Like, what the fuck is this? It's like, the world is a timeline, and everything that happens to you happens to you at some point. It's like, we're all waiting for the train to arrive at some point... What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? You're not even aware that something exists for a long time. What the fuck is this?

~!~I don't know how to deal with my family's parents.

TheGhost: So I'm in my Mom's place over the weekend and her sister and her brother are having an argument over something.
My dad and brother are saying they don't believe in marriage but love to do it and want to educate themselves about it. They are arguing over whether marriage is bad for you or good.
My mom's argument is that I'm the one who should marry her brother. He's 26 and her father is 34. 
My dad is stone cold crazy about me and my situation. He's a big time supporter of Christianity and I'm not. He's like a stepfather to me. He's one of the best friends I have. 
I'm just trying to figure out how to deal with this. Help me out.
-----
Mammoth Jones: Why not just ask them individually? You might have some family issues but that's expected.
-----
CormoranStrike: Why not talk with your father?
-----
Brock Reiher: Just talk to them?
-----
TheGhost: I feel like I'm going to get into arguments and arguments will start to come up. I just didn't want to make the connection with her and my parents so I didn't bother. I just want to know how to deal with it and see how others do it.
-----
RolandOfGilead: Just talk with your dad. Honestly, if your parents aren't in your house then it's probably a bad situation to be in. It's not like they've all been raised in a home where a majority of the time you're in your own room. 
Just don't go in any general tangent about it. Just don't start a discussion with them.

TheGhost: I'm sorry I thought my immediate question was a good answer.

skipgo: Just tell them to just chill.

TheGhost: I just wanted to be clear.
My family has been having arguments over marriage for at least a decade. My dad is a real piece of shit right now. He's openly atheist and has some racial and homophobic views and is married to my mom. That, and my mom is an abusive husband and has been telling my dad constantly about how persecuted she is and how she's trying to do what he disapproves about her doing.

~!~My dad is single and he's actually trying to break away from the life he's led to.

Wag: My dad is 60 and he's 72. I had a dream where I was 22 when I met him. He was a single guy, but he had a wife and two kids. I've been single for over a decade. He and I are trying to break away from our lives.
This is the kind of life we do have together. I'm in my late 20s now, I'm in my early 30s. He's single, for sure. I wish I had a little bit of control over my life when it comes to finances. He's a good guy and he did what I needed to do. I'm happy for him, and I'm happy for him.
I don't know how to feel. I hope I'm not a downer. I'm not a Trumpeter. I'm not married. I'm not trying to take my own kids away. I'm not looking for a life of privilege. All of that, for the right reasons. I wish I was married and had kids. I want to be successful, but I'm not. I want to be happy, but I don't want to be alone. I want to be happy, but I don't want to be alone. I've been single for 17 years now, but I don't know how to feel like that.
-----
Aurongel: I wish I could say I wish people in similar circumstances exist, given the circumstances of their circumstances. My dad is single, and his wife is single, and that's having two kids. I'm single because of a combination of health reasons, my life is looking on the way, and that's putting an infant through life without the stress of being in a relationship. I'm not looking for a life of riches or material possessions, but I do want to be happy.

~!~"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (recommended reading)

Kazoku_: I just finished a must-read for those who want to learn more about the many awful things that happen on a regular basis. I recommend it by Robert A. G. Sorkin and it's been posted twice in the past few weeks.
For those who don't know what it is, here it is.
A little synopsis:
A father of two boys is scum and a swindler.
About to be murdered by a man called Ted.
Bad guys in his past like evil tend to bring out the worst in people.
At the same time they also like Ted, so they kill him.
And then there's his wife, so they murder him.
And now that he's no longer Ted, he comes back and threatens to kill his son or wife.
I highly recommend that. I'm not an Riker or any other kind of warrior, but I do think he'll win.
Here's a bad guy with a son and a wife who's entitled to be killed by the guys.
And here's a guy who's been living on the streets in Sydney for years after this was done.
Yes, that's Mark Serling.
I just finished a longer read on this but this is just a great introduction to a great new story. I think it's a great introduction to a great genre.
I really want to read more. Has anyone else read this?
-----
Mórríoghain: I recommend it. Mark Serling is great, and I hope it gets better with time.

~!~In other big cities, do you guys have to pay more for health insurance?

entremet: I've lived in a few countries and all major counties offer more generous (public) healthcare plans. I know that most (if not all?) US residents pay for it, and I'm a big proponent of municipalities having more detailed information about plans. But I've never been a fan of the idea of paying more.
I think that's ultimately up to the municipalities. My biggest fear is that having to pay out of pocket for your entire healthcare plan (not that I mind that). I kind of hate seeing the absolute maximum hikes in copays on higher deductibles, but I think that's a bit too much to ask.
-----
Hollywood Duo: I'm not sure why you are against increased taxes but for the average person not paying any more it would be a good thing.
-----
entremet: Who cares if you're making less money? That's self-centered.
-----
NSA: I'm not sure if I'm on the right track or not but I think that's part of the reason for the increased copays. I've never seen a hospital/health insurance company raise my healthcare costs if I'm not paying.
-----
NoMoreTrolls: The increased copays are just a bonus for the higher tier plans. That's more of a hike than anything you're actually paying.
-----
JealousKenny: I'm not against increased taxes but I do want higher taxes for myself. As a kid I was paying like $1600 a month with a car and I'm completely okay with that. I have better things to do to help the world. I just don't see what higher taxes are worth.
-----
Mugy: I pay $2000 a year for my family, I see half my money on my Roth IRA, so I'm basically paying about 25% of what my girlfriend's family pays. I think thats a pretty nice difference
-----
Hollywood Duo: I don't see how healthcare is that much more expensive. I just think that if you are not paying as much you are not contributing to society.
-----
TickleMeElbow: I pay $1600 a month for my family and we're okay with it.
-----
Squirrel Killer: I don't see how it is as a system, but you know what? I don't see any

~!~Life-Threatening Software

SOLDIER: I’m not sure if this belongs on here, but I just got a new friend who’s really tough about a lot of things. He’s a pharmacist who got fired for caring about people. He’s a “super-powerful” that can’t stand sunlight or food poisoning. He’s pretty anti-social, but he’s a nice guy.
He’s a big guy with a really big voice. He’s always been vocal about stuff like this. I’ve been having a really rough time with him, but I think we at least have some common ground. He always makes people around him feel like they’re owed a little favor, and nobody owes him anything. Any advice from anyone with a similar experience would be much appreciated.

Brock Reiher: "will blow your brains out"

"Will" also some would say was a more serious threat than "will blow your brains out".
Either way, it's going to be his last.

~!~How do you deal with difficulty of work?

Troll: I’m a teacher and I work a 7-day week. It’s hard work, but it’s fun. I enjoy it and I like my job. I’m not depressed about it but I worry about having a stress eating disorder. It’s a struggle sometimes maybe. I don’t know if I’m just being overcompensated. I just had a really rough day today. Workwise it’s good, I guess. I hate having to deal with work stuff. Some people are just rough. What about you?
-----
Doggg: I struggle with it, but I feel depressed when it happens. I could be in trouble for a minute and not have to deal with it myself.

DrFunk: I struggle with it a lot, mostly politically.

-----
jcs: I struggle with it, but I feel that I tend to be the one that doesn't do shit. I'm an idiot. I work hard. I love my kids. I don't feel bad about being tired for work, I just feel that I have to do what I want to do.
-----
Elfotografoalocado: I struggle with it, but I feel that I should be the one to actually do something about it. I don't get it at all.
-----
Wackamole: I struggle with it, but I do it because I know I'll get laid. 
It sucks.
I struggle with it mostly because I'm not a child. 
I'll have a class where I'll be working on something and will be reading my classes, and I'll be doing something I know I'll get into. Who knows.

~!~The Problem With ‘Good Omatoes’ and ‘Paul Scheer’ Films (Foreign Press)

Sibersk Esto: I mean, in the U.S. the two are basically the same thing, except that it’s the same company.
-----
HStallion: The amount of critics and audiences who watched Paul Scheer's films is rather notable isn't it? I saw Paul Scheer's Bad Guys 3 and it's had a lot of positive reviews, especially with being a foreign film (like Jaws).
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Is this a joke? I don’t think so. They both look like the same movie.
-----
Dishwalla: I've loved Bad Guys, I'm a big Paul Scheer fan. I also watch Paul's films every day. It's just that no matter what the reception is, I can't bring myself to watch Scheer's films when I don't have the chance.
-----
Sibersk Esto: I think it's because critics usually like foreign films outside the U.S. So it was a bit of a lukewarm reaction to the film.
-----
ReginOfFire: I had no idea that Bad guys was a thing

~!~"He's not a white supremacist, he's just a Trump voter" is the most depressing thing to hear

TheDutchSlayer: So i was reading a bit about some white supremacist in the wakanda. I don't know why exactly he is a white supremacist but it's something like anti-vaxxers or something. 
He is a man who has been propagated as a white supremacist and now wants to spread his hateful ideology around to the womens and womens of countries. 
He is vaxxing and spreading his hateful beliefs because his blood crosses the line due to his belief that white people shouldn't be oppressed. 
I just at this point think of the womens' that will do anything to protect their womens from their oppressors.
-----
TerminusFox: I mean, he's not, it's just a trump voter
-----
Skelepuzzle: I'm a white supremacist, but I do think that white supremacy is a thing.
-----
VectorPrime: No, no, it’s a racist term for someone who thinks Obama’s presidency was illegitimate.

Any hacks to make sure this never happens again?
-----
xxracerxx: Have you checked the password manager? Password protection is really good for this too.
-----
georaldc: This is a good question. I’m still trying to figure out what the limits are for the phone. Are there specific apps that require a password (e.g. Malware).
-----
nsilvias: do you need the password to do this? you can check here:
-----
Starset: Nope!
-----
THEVOID: I did check the password manager, I like to use the iCloud app.
-----
xxracerxx: Just look for the iOS or macOS password manager.
-----
georaldc: Yeah, I used the password manager at work and the password was only for backup purposes. So I guess that’s not a big deal.
-----
zerocalories: go to password manager, it will unlock your phone
-----
Dingens: Just have to have the password on hand at a minimum. On my laptop, i use Mac OS, so that's useful. But on my phone, I'm using Windows Phone. I can't really use it as my main phone, so I don't need to use it as a password for everything.

~!~What are the best next-level equipment for PC gaming?

Deepwater: I'm curious if there's any major next-level equipment for PC gaming that you all can recommend, and why?
My first-born passion is audio/video games, so I'm thinking about the 10 dollar P115. It's a pair of speakers, a discrete audio mini-pro and a mini-bitstream card. It's a Corsair H2O case, and it's a Corsair H2O laptop case. I'm not a gamer, but I want something that won't kill me.
I already have a basic Corsair CX300, but the amp is too small for gaming.
-----
BubbaKrumpz: I’m going to be building a PC with a couple of speakers and I’ll be buying a receiver + receiver + amp. I need something for those so I can listen to music without it killing my graphics card.
-----
Deepwater: I know, I can’t help you with the budget. What is the best way to buy one of these?
-----
johan: I’d be buying the most expensive stereo amp you could get. From what I’ve seen on reddit it can be a decent starter for what you want, but if you want to get into deep bass mode you need an amp with good range and a dedicated subwoofer.
-----
johan: I've been on a kickstarter, I doubt I'll get a good deal on it
-----
deepwater: But what about an amp with a dedicated subwoofer? I don't think I know how to get that anywhere :/
-----
deepwater: So I'm thinking of the Corsair CX300, which is something like $1200 for a speaker alone, or maybe $1200 if you want a receiver and sub, but $1200 for an amp. Speakers are fine, but could very well be a glorified sound bar.
I don't know enough about PC audio to recommend whether you should get a receiver and sub, if at all. The amp doesn't seem to offer the best bang for your buck, and won't be able to create a meaningful difference in performance.
-----
deepwater: I'm not sure where you are without playing with things and not quite knowing the best way to get started...
-----
johan: Right now

~!~If you were in charge of the nuclear missile issue, would you?

Redhead On Moped: I grew up in the era of the IC. That's what we are all taught, not to get involved.
As a 32 year old man, I have always been aware of the issue of nukes/dust particles. How they are produced, how long they last, how big they are, and of course the vulnerabilities of materials to withstand the pressure. To me, no matter how good the material is, it could destroy easily. I'm now an expert in Nuclear engineering and all that stuff.
I'd like to think that I would. I've got an engineering degree from MIT.
Would you be in charge of it? What would you do?
-----
Brashnir: No.
-----
staedtler: I'm in charge of Nuclear engineering, I'd do everything possible to stop/prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.

Also, no.

Something that keeps being very well known ( especially when we are talking about games )

What do you guys think?

-----
Einchy: In most cases it's pretty simple, just copy the flag that you want out.
-----
Taki: I'm pretty sure I duplicate those in case I forget something important.
-----
Hollywood Duo: This is why you use a desktop site to store the info.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: It's really fast on the Android side, but slow on the iOS. It's also a godsend because of the notifications. You can't organize them all in a desktop site or app.

BAD: I'm getting quite annoyed with the lack of traditional animation. There's so many "dances" in the world that I want to just get up to and dance around for a while.
For example, it's a real good time. But there's this 5th or 6th episode of Archer that's already been great but I want to just get out and dance around, I want to do weird dance moves but in the fake Japanese accent of the two links dancing.
What's the deal?

1. Research my career path to better understand how to work in the various technologies that are out there.

5. Have a full time job.

Kukulcan: A new study has shown that Trump’s lies are caused by immigrants. 
It shows how the vast majority of the US’s immigrant population are failing to keep up with the job market. 
The study also showed that the majority of the US’s policies to illegals were to good effect in Europe, and that a third of the immigrant’s are not, and that the US has a huge deficit in domestic programs without properly raising the budget as we needed to do so.
-----
Sho_Nuff82: Gross.

~!~What is the best time to wait for a movie?

maxxpower: I don't take any chances here. I'm always in the mood to watch something, even if it's a movie I'm not feeling it. I usually prefer waiting till the last possible moment before i go to sleep, so if I don't feel like watching tomorrow, I just wait it out.
I've noticed that I don't get the need to be waited on for a movie until I'm already in the mood to see it.

~!~Do you believe in the concept of a "Good" Life?

Megalosaro: I'm in my mid-twenties and still feel I believe in a large number of things I believe in. I don't consider myself to be a good person, I've just been a complete failure in several aspects.
The most obvious one that I have is getting old. I'm 30, and I'm also in a bad situation. I still have a long way to go. I still have some friends, but I've just been let down by the situation and have a lot of family. I'm not even sure what to do, and I don't want to start getting involved in the kind of arguments I do. I know, I know... that's it? I don't know what to do.
I want to do something, but I want to be proactive. I feel I'm always being proactive, so I feel like I'm always the one being talked to about how I got better or changed. I just don't know what to do. I've had many many many relationships, and I have no idea what to do. I don't know what to do in these situations. I have far too many close family members, and I'm scared of going down that road, and I just feel like I'm not doing enough.
On the other hand, I feel that I have a job. I work at a restaurant, so I'm on a team, so I'm working on projects, and I'm finishing school. I'm also good at my job. I'm not focused on it.
I'm trying to like myself in a healthy way, but I am trying to think of myself in terms of good and not bad, and I don't really have a good answer to these questions.
Do you think that life is a kind of Good? Do you think that life is a kind of Bad? Do you think that life is a kind of Bad? Are you personally a good person?
-----
Puck Beaverton: Have you read the book "Seven Brains" by Graham Greene?

~!~What is the best way to watch/read DRM-free media?

Squarehard: Just wanted to get a little bit of informed discussion here, and if there's one thing I should be aware of, it's the ability to listen to DRM-free media without the need for a subscription.
I've been using a podcast app for a while, and it's a good place to start to learn more about the industry.
What are some good apps to learn about?
What are some good DRM-free media players and services?
Thanks!
-----
cyress8: I don't know about subscription but I have "Play Music" turned on that I use. Recorded podcasts, YouTube videos and playing them on a player are a great option.
-----
Maktokious: I have a Sony Music AV player that works really well for me. The player has multiple inputs into it, and the DRM-free option is the only one. The player itself supports up to 128 bps or more.
The player app has a free version if you don't want to pay for it.

Do you buy things online or do you leave it on the shelf or a case?

~!~Defend your job and save money.

Puck Beaverton: So I am a school teacher. I have 3 vacation days this year. I have all of my classes this fall. I have been doing well lately with students. I have about $450 saved up to pay for next year. I have about $600 saved. I am looking to save more this fall.
Important notes:
This is not about saving and pocket money. This is about saving and going above and beyond and saving in terms of your money in a 401k and in savings. This is only about saving. If you’re getting more than your paycheck, you will need to account for inflation. For example, if your paycheck is ~$10k, consider the amount of saving you saved. If you saved less than this amount, save less. This is only about saving. If you are getting more than your paycheck, you are part of the problem. 
This is not about saving for 401k. This is about saving for a 401k. This is only about saving for an IRA. 
This is all about terminology. What do you do when you are asked for money? What do you do when you aren’t asked for money? Do you save for yourself or others? Or for yourself and your savings? Or do you take out a loan? 
Do you save for yourself or others?
I don’t want to sound snobby, but I am asking for advice.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: What other things are you doing that you know are absolutely necessary for your job and you are absolutely doing them?
-----
shira: if you have no savings. in your case you are learning something new.

Puck Beaverton: I’ve never heard of this. I just need to hear that I have a savings account.

Teh Hamburglar: Thats the thing. You can't save your money if you don't have any savings.
-----
Robochimp: You can save money in the stock market. You can't save money in the crypto.

~!~Mission To Improve Housing In Flint, Michigan Is Baffled

wenis: For those who don't know, Flint’s citywide housing crisis was led by a white supremacist. Some people who follow the story of Shimon Hutchison are right about that, but even more people are still ignorant that Flint’s population was under the control of the state and federal governments for a decade after the city was shut down. 
I'm just wondering how the hell all this anti-fiora

-----
Kuro: I don't eat that much. I drink like 5 soft drinks a day and I drink like 2 energy drinks. I don't smoke or do anything that forces me to do so.

Dishwalla: probably around 1.5 rmb a week or so. kids probably eat less than me but I probably get more bang for my buck.

~!~Why do businesses do everything they can to reduce or avoid losses?

BronzeWolf: Was just talking to a friend of mine earlier today. He said that he's a manager at a business and he has seen a lot of instances where cash was given out to customers at the other end of the spectrum, and those cash flow issues are coming to a head these days. In a way, this is really a case of people making a choice between not working their PTO, or being a pfwe, and those businesses are just doing everything they can to reduce or avoid loss. 
Do you believe that businesses should do everything they can to minimize or avoid losses? How do you think they play the game?
-----
Dishwalla: i do my best to minimize my losses but i'm not a pwe
-----
ISOM: Because I'm not a pwe.
-----
ZOONAMI: Because a business doesn't have to invest money in a particular stock.
-----
Cocolina: Because we have better options, less regulatory pressure, lower taxes for everyone, and businesses are more predictable.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Because it's easier and faster to just purchase a ticket on eBay, buy a ticket directly from them via stock transaction, and not take out a $2000 ticket after you've purchased your tickets.
-----
Mivey: Because it's easier and faster and it's less assholes.
-----
Heromanz: Because everyone has better choices
-----
Shugga: Because the market is a racket
-----
GrizzleBoy: Because companies and companies keep making less passive part time orders to try and push their business to the backwater practices necessary.
This sounds like a good plan.

How have we (the United States) handled this comparison between Japan and the United States? And how have we handled this comparison between Japan and the United States? In the past decade, I've seen many articles talking about how Japan has very very little of what the United States does, and how there has been very little in the past decade. For example, here's a recent article about a very interesting topic that popped up recently, and it's not a debate, but rather a comment on the topic:
The thread about the "old" vs. "new" question
Brainchild
Interesting article, but not a debate, it's a comment on the topic, and the thread
More details at:
-----
Heckler456: I'm not sure this is a good idea. The old is still used in western administrations, and depending on the situation and the electorate, a new is always going to be used.
-----
Taki: Yo, I think the new is going to be used.
-----
Liljagare: Did you read article?
Curious to see what opinion is here when all of this happens.
-----
brainchild: The thread about the "old" vs. "new" question was intended as an exchange discussion on the topic.
-----
Liljagare: I mean, I think the issue is that there is a debate going on in the Western world to decide what is "old" and "old" and what is "old".
-----
Dr.Phibes: Disclaimer: I don't believe in gods, and I don't believe in karma or anything.
-----
brainchild: Okay, I understand that ethic/ethical issues make sense to me, but I thought the thread was going to have some discussion.
I just don't feel like there's enough discussion around this in the Western world.
-----

The new is always used

I've taken a long, painful morning walk, but it's been for about 10 minutes. I'm trembling and I'm already scared to get up. I tried to find a video and I'm on the ground. I'm still trying to move but I'm so scared for the life of me. I'm just scared that I'm going to lose my balance and then fall to my knees and I'll be out for the rest of my life.
I'm so sorry to hear this. I'm just so used to living here and sitting at home because of the pain.

Was it good?

Nintendo Switch: It was good. Not as good as the first, but it was good.
-----
Krejlooc: I think they're both good movies, but I think it's a better movie overall.
-----
Clockblockers: It’s a bad movie but a good movie.
-----
Slayven: I used to read that as the X-mas sequel
-----
Krejlooc: I think they're both good, but a good movie. I think it's a good movie, but a bad movie, because the movie never ages well. And it's not the end of the world, like the movie is saying, in the last 20 minutes, that the kids are going to die.
-----
Kinthey: I think it was a good movie, but not as good as the original.
-----
Mahonay: It was a decent movie.

~!~New Era - The Rise of the Individual

Jazzy: This is an amazing piece of news, I think it's a start to the end of the cold war.
The article itself goes into a lot of detail about the individual, their situation and the world. I also highly recommend reading the whole thing, it's a good read.
-----
SugarNoodles: How the fuck did the US go so far? I can't even get my head around the hypocrisy of this article.
-----
Kasai: I think the intent was probably more to stir the pot of western media, but that's just me.
The best part of the article is that, as it goes into more about the individual, it's easier to see that the reason they are all are the exact same. It's a nice change of pace and a win for western civilization.
-----
jelly: I'm not American and I don't know many countries that have similar problems, but the US and Europe, well Europe is a very complex society, we have to deal with the same issues both from the perspective of the whole society and the perspective of the individual.
-----
Kthulhu: This is called Resistance in my book.

Cantaim: That's great to hear, thank you for sharing. I also like the piece.

Empyrean Cocytus: I'll never be convinced that the West is the bad one. The sad truth is that the world is a much better place than the one we inherited it from.
-----
shnurgleton: I'm not saying that the West is the good one but it sure is a place to be. We had the same problems as the European one, I believe it was by mistake
-----
GeoNeo: I personally believe that there is a bigger problem in the Western hemisphere that nobody has had the better sense to fix, because we have the problems in the Middle East and SouthEast, and have the most dangerous of global democracy, but I also believe that the west is the good one.

TheJackdog: its not even that funny, its just that good

Sjay1994: I feel like this subreddit is a great gateway into the world of political commentary. 
There's even a subreddit for political posters and the r/Thedonald subreddit is also a great gateway. 
So, has anyone here used it? How did you decide to get into it? How did you get to the peak of the subreddit? 
I'm not sure if I'm being a dumb baby or if I'm just being overly sensitive to criticism.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'm a dumb baby.
-----
Deleted member 15326: Good subreddit? I only see shit about Trump and their affair on here
-----
RedBlue: I used to use it when I was in high school but I think I stopped around college age. It became too political and I now don’t care at all about the political shit anymore.
-----

Sjay1994: It's an old reddit, but a lot of the shitposting here is actually a good gateway. The conversation is usually Trump or Kavanaugh, so there's always a shot of the pro-Trump side.
-----

RedBlue: I think the r/Thedonald subreddit is a good gateway but it’s not perfect. There’s a lot of bullshit on there. The creators of the subreddit were vocal about the necessity of banning all left-leaning accounts.
-----
N.Domixis: I use it for comedy podcasts and it’s a great gateway into the political satire section of tumblr. I’m not sure if I should delete it or not, but I feel it has gotten a lot creepier on it’s own.

Sjay1994: Yeah I'm not sure if I should delete it or not.

So what is the best way to list all the best of the year pieces?

~!~I just learned about the ulissary effect

Wag: I live in a small town and have been a member of the family for over 25 years. I have noticed something peculiar about everyone in the family. I am right next to the grandpa's family's family, and I know that the grandpa has always been one of the better people around. The other grandpa is a drug addict who is a big brother to the youngest child. He is a wise man, and has always maintained his moral side. He is pure and always strives to do good deeds for others. His mom is a prostitute. Their dad is a criminal and the one who runs the family. I feel like I am the bad side of all the bad things happening in the family. I feel like I survived a lot less than my dad.
But other than that, I don't know. It's messing with my mind. I don't know what to make of all of these people. I don't know what to do with this information. Does anyone know any interesting facts or experiences? Any interesting people with interesting lives? I am just wondering.
-----
Medalion: I'm beginning to think that the ulissary effect is real
-----
Wag: I'm not sure if it's just part of the psychology of the family or not.
-----
Gustaf: dude, i am a pretty gooood person
i have done drugs and alcohol in and of itself, I have taken medicocap, etc in the past that i found to be effective
i am more concerned with the effects those drugs have on us than our bodies
i am not sure if i have done drugs or alcohol in the past
i will say the social norms are more important for us than we think
-----
Wag: I think I have never seen anyone in my life that does drugs or alcohol.
-----
Ravensmash: I haven't seen anyone that is really like the Grandparents.
The Grandparents are more like theunts relatives and are closer to the family.
I've seen people I know do drugs and alcohol, and no one has ever had any of those experiences.
-----
wafflebrain: I grew up in a pretty conservative area, but my parents weren't that into drugs. I'm like a half-step away from them, and I'd take drugs and alcohol over anything if it actually had a negative effect

~!~How to deal with family who refuse to forgive you

Widdle Puppy: So I recently had to send my mum a letter pleading with her to forgive me and to accept my apology that my sins were forgiven. Her response was that she would never forgive anyone but herself. Which of course made me furious, I have no shame whatsoever and I was in the process of trying to get her to forgive me and I made a huge mistake that could have been fatal for her.
I went to the police and I'm still not sure what to do, she's a very poor person and has a very strong moral compass and she is very much not an empath. Her stepfather is the worst person for whom I live, she is a very poor person and a very white woman. I'm not against her apology but I'm very much against her saying what she really meant.
It's not a whole hearted life we live in right now, I have done a lot of good things and I am sorry if this thread is not sit well. My stepfather is a terrible person and he has really bad family and friends who are basically just happy to be around me but they won't do it. I have had a lot of good experiences in the past and am not sure what to do here. I am not a reformed offender or anything but he is a horrible person and I have a good chance of getting it back if I make some changes. I do not deserve to be in any position of power that makes me angry.
I can't even confess anymore because I'm angry at myself, I don't deserve forgiveness and I am sorry for your pain. I understand now and I feel for you and I'm sorry for your pain.
-----
Bakercat: Sorry for your loss. I know what it feels like to be a part of that life. As much as I hate to admit it, you are not the sole reason I have forgiven you. I can't even imagine what it would be like for someone to forgive themselves after so many years of pain.
-----
Widdle Puppy: That's a good question, thank you for that, I'm sure I'm just giving my own perspective.
-----
effingvic: Sorry for your loss. It's always good to know.
Sorry to hear.
-----
Widdle Puppy: Honestly I can't even remember what happened, I think I just changed my life.

~!~What are some common things that look almost exactly like what they seem to be?

ToddBonzalez: I was watching Infinity War and realized the first thing I noticed is the bottle of Faygo to my right. It's the same color as the bottle of Faygo to my left. I then realized that I can't figure out if it's a puppy or a dog because I can't figure out what a bottle of Faygo looks like. I also can't figure out the name of it's parent, as it's an alien creature that appeared in a vacuum. Then I realized that I can't figure out the name of the dog because I can't figure it out. I then realized it's a dog that appeared in a vacuum. I then realized it's a dog that appeared in a vacuum. I also realized that the name of the dog I found in the vacuum was "Dune"
-----
ZOONAMI: Someone once said that the "Faye" is a pretty big hair thing.
-----
Mulciber: The "Powdered Egg" is a pretty big egg.

Puck Beaverton: I don't think I've ever seen it in the rain.
-----
ZOONAMI: There are two kinds of things that look like this:
1. The "Powdered Egg" part
2. The "Faygo" part
Did someone ever say "Powdered Egg"? I think the correct term is what you want.
-----
Shugga: The word "furday" just popped into my head.

Mulciber: Furday!

====================
~!~Why does every single good movie have to be about a good plot?

TheFallenSaboteur: This topic is so often framed in films and TV where the good doesn't have to necessarily be about the movie itself. For example, a bad plot with a bad villain is usually a bad plot in the first place. But a good plot with a good villain can also be a good plot in the first place. Why does every single good movie have to have a good villain?
I just want to discuss the idea of making a movie about the good villain. I know the answer is probably no. But I think it's a lot more productive than just asking people to put a good villain on screen, in the same way that a good villain doesn't automatically make a good movie.
-----
Platy: I think it is easier to make a movie that is more focused on a good villain than a good one.
If the plot is not about a good villain then maybe some of the good ones are it, but if the plot is about a good one then they are good.
-----
Fat4all: I’m good at using good as a negative
-----
Mona: i like that a lot of the good ones are just bad, i just like the villain as a bad person
-----
BDS: Because it's a movie where a good villain is often just a bad one.
-----
John Dunbar: villain that is good is better than a villain that is evil.
Spoiler
-----
WrenchNinja: I think it's dumb to focus on a good villain. Let's go full mazzy over the good ones while we're at it.
-----
Wracu: I think it's more productive to make movies about a good villain than a villain that is evil.
A good villain is someone who is the protagonist of a film, but someone who is a terrible person.
-----
FRANKEINSTEIN: I'd say I feel like a lot of people have difficulty with Good & Evil.
Spoiler
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Now this I think is a problem. It's time we stop and rethink the definition of a villain and their characteristics. It's an easy way to invalidate a film's perceived strength and therefore to make good films weaker.

~!~What are some things that you are afraid of doing or having to learn new things?

Liquid Plejades: I've been taking proactive steps to stop myself from doing or learning things incorrectly, but I really don't see myself stopping.
I'm being proactive to avoid feeling like I'm going to kill myself or worse.
I have a pretty good handle on this one:
I've even done a little bit of both. I was pleasantly surprised by this one a few years ago because I would just read something on the internet and I was like "man, this is why I always look up to the summer" but then I had some really bad back pain and it took a week for me to get any sort of decent painkillers and I continued taking them one by one and it did nothing for two weeks. Then after some more pain I finally got some last night and it's gone, I just don't know if it's worth sticking with it. I'm worried I'm going to pass out.

Daffy Duck: I love the Disney ride but in a bad way.

chadskin: Welcome to Disney's Hollywood Studios, a crown jewel of the company's cultural success.
I'm not a huge movie buff but I do see tons of people there, and usually I'm in the mood for a "meh" movie experience. I'm not complaining. I'm here for the fun of the crowd.
What are your thoughts?
-----
marrec: Does it matter if the movie is good? The audience for such movies are usually diverse in some key ways.
I'm just trying to think of exactly what kind of experience would come out of all the people there.
-----
Zoe: It can be fun, but don't treat it as a negative.
The only thing is to find out.
-----
Sandfox: When they say "it's good" what they mean is "we're all there for the MCU" or something similar.
-----

Z-Beat: It's mostly a fun movie to watch. I'm in for the opening night if it's anything like what I saw.
-----
Crushed: I'm cool, but I'd rather be the center of a fucking screen than the center of a screen is where I'd want to be.
-----

TheBaldwin: I like the first act, but when it starts to get too fucking weird, i tend to stop and wonder. Its usually just meh movies with the main character flying through a plane or some shit.
But after that , i generally go back and enjoy it.
-----
Zoe: They're not "meh" in the way that "meh" should be.

Geek: I'm not a strong person because I've never had sex with anyone. Usually when I have sex, I keep my arms and legs above the person's body, but sometimes I'm too scared to get it. I am scared of stuff like anxiety disorder and intense anxiety disorder.
I'm a strong person because I've tried to change in previous relationships, but I'm also a very shy person. I'm also not a strong person because I've never had sex with anyone.
I'm not a strong person because I'm not a strong person because I'm not a strong person because I'm not a strong person because... I don't know what to say to you. Thank you for being, a wonderful person.

-----
Rocketz: I'm not a strong person because I've never had sex.
But I am a very strong person because I have suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time. And I love being depressed and anxious.
But I do love having fun, I love playing sports, I love working out, I love being a social media heavy person and I love sex.
But I don't know what to do, I don't have kids, I don't have a girlfriend.
-----
Angie22: I’m not a strong person because I’ve never had sex.

Transistor: Did you sign up for Covered Unidi?
-----
Troll: No. I've never signed up for anything Covered Unidi offers.

sphagnum: Is this a scam?
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: Go to the doctor you don't want to sign up for anything
-----
KojiKnight: Sounds like a scam to me, so you should call your insurance company. The doctor may take a look and rule out some fraud based on this.

~!~What is the best (non-gaming) media streaming device?

Jangowuzhere: I'm looking for something portable with good internet/TV quality. Does anyone have any suggestions?
-----
ZOONAMI: The best I can suggest is a Roku with at least an antenna.
-----
NSA: I'd say the Shield would be the best option, but the Sony UP970 is a great option.
-----
signal: If you have a Roku, get the Shield or the Fire HD are the same.
-----
Messofanego: If you want something super portable, the Samsung S4, the best one you can get is $800
-----
diablos991: The X, the original.
-----
Kill3r7: Sony WI‑Fast Charging USB Smart TV.
-----
GLHFGodbless: The Shield is the best TV cord.
-----
jett: I'd say the Shield, but the S4's are pretty great.
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: The PS4 Pro is the best TV cord.

~!~The Fate of the Furious: Tokyo Drift reboot might happen if the current generation dies off

Sega Dreamcast: UPDATE:
The Fate of the Furious twitter account has responded
I'd be down for an American Ultra reboot.
-----
SuperBanana: Would be cool to see them actually involve the X-Men or even just the X-Men in general.
-----

Mariolee: I'd be down aswell.
-----
Slayven: That is the fucking plot of a reboot of the franchise, you manage your shit
-----
Zapperino: How about a more serious Star Wars reboot?
-----
PSqueak: Sounds good to me, but the franchise is still a mess.
-----
Gustaf: do i remember that correctly?
-----
Khanimus: I think they were going to do a reboot of the franchise, but then again it was the plot of a Star Wars movie reboot that killed that possibility.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I’d be so down.

~!~What was your first weekend like?

Grannvale: I'm sitting here with a full schedule of what's to be had in the weekend. No weekends off, no hotel, no work, no travel, just what I'd want to do in the city proper.
I'm starting to get a bit lost, and I'm going to need to make a list of things I want to do in the city proper. Does anyone have a list?
Nothing against movies, games, or food, though? I just want to branch out and see what all of those things would be like.
I've seen the first three Star Wars movies in theaters since they came out in 2015.
My first Indiana Jones was on VHS.
-----
____: I played Arkham Horror the first time I had a DVD player and a starter set of Star Wars Legends of the Jedi.
-----
Aurongel: I went to a few amusement park theme parks in Florida last year, and they had a bunch of the stuff I wanted to do. Lots of food, a few games and a few movies.
-----
Maxey: I spent my weekend in Little Tokyo.
-----
brainchild: I did a few bars in Tokyo as well, but nothing that wild like Solo: A Star Wars Story.
-----
Omegasquatic: I play a few games in Tokyo, so a few games in my area.
-----
Praxis: I've been to Wano, which is a pretty decent but not amazing theme park. A couple of drinks, one of the food spots there is a fantastic seafood restaurant. There's a lot of space for a variety of things including drinking, food, and overall environment.
-----
grannvale: I went to a family party in San Francisco with their friends when we were all there, and they had a variety of drinks. Lots of food, a variety of games, and a variety of food.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Only one of my friends went to one I was seeing in Tokyo, and I went with two of them. I don't know why, but I don't really like family, or a variety of things. I've got two, one of them, and I haven't seen them in a while.
I'm going to go with the other one.

~!~Mueller Requests Investigation Into Kremlin-Trolling Campaign Director's Ex-lobby

Shard Shinjuku: 
-----

Cochese: Mueller has subpoenaed and the campaign.
-----
liquidtmd: *sigh*
I am still not sure what to make of this.
-----
Kurdel: Good, this is an important development in the ongoing investigation.
-----

Seik: Oh, whoops.
-----
RoyaleDuke: Well, that wraps it up.

Sagroth: So, there's your list of 'Whoop my butt', my people.

~!~Never thought this would happen: Jaimie's War of the Worlds Manga

TheGamingNewsGuy: I am one of those people who likes to read manga/anime and thought this was a very interesting topic to see share. I am curious about the manga/anime and if you have seen/re Recommended/Expected this Thread. I am hoping someone can give me some insight for better enjoyment when I am not reading.

~!~Trump’s Inaugural Committee raised nearly $6 million from wealthy donors, records show

Tovarisc: Many highlights:
-----
Wafflinson: Good, but not nearly as much as people wanted to spend on Trump's inauguration.
-----
DrewFu: He's not wrong, and he's not wrong.
-----
Jpop: That is some money.
-----
Tovarisc: It is.
-----
Piecake: This is why you don't run for office.
-----
Kmonk: I am amazed that the right is such crazy people. To donate that much to Trump, you'd think he would be the least crazy person in the world.
-----
Powdered Egg: What a sham.
-----
Dr. Benton Quest: Nobody is surprised at this part of the world.
-----
Wafflinson: Sometimes.

~!~What's the best part of using a voice changer?

RadioJoNES: (Not a comedy humor thread)
The thing is, I don't think I've ever used a voice changer so flawlessly as a professional, professional voice actor. It's also the most handy, so you can easily do it yourself if you're into that sort of thing.
For those looking for deeper dive, I've done it in the past and found the most useful bits in the below audio episode I did.
-----
RadioJoNES: I used to use a voice changer to mute a guy out in Illinois. I ended up going to the hospital because I had to keep it on all night to go back to the doctor. I ended up getting him checked out and he was fine.
-----
L Thammy: If you can, I recommend using a stand up one. I use a stand up one for my stand ups, but others can be had for more under $10.
-----
RadioJoNES: I'm a bit stunned you could find this on Amazon. It's like I'm gonna take a crap with YouTube or something, but I don't want to fuck with that.
-----
Rackham: Having a voice changer is pretty invaluable. Just be careful when you're using it too.
-----
RadioJoNES: I'm new to this whole thing, so I don't know.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've used one for years, was a fairly solid performer. I'm not a comedian and wouldn't recommend it, but I'm fine with it for now.
-----
RadioJoNES: They're not the best ones, but they're pretty cool. Not particularly the best ones, but a fun novelty.
-----
RadioJoNES: I've used them in the past, but the latest I ended up having to use them for a movie I wasn't big into, so I stopped.
-----
RadioJoNES: I'm not really a huge comedian, but I found the Voice Changer helpful and it was funny. I also thought the "Chime in" joke in "Last Exit to Springfield" was funny.

~!~White House official resigns amid allegations of embezzlement

Shard Shinjuku: 
-----
Beartruck: No way, you're fired.
-----
RPGamer92: He'll be the next VP of the US.
-----
uzipukki: Fired from his job.
-----

Cochese: Ding ding ding
-----
Dubbedinenglish: I'm sure Trump will be tweeting about this tonight
-----
Coyote Starrk: What an asshole.
-----
Dishwalla: that's pretty big
-----
BWoog: This is the first I'm hearing of someone taking their Trump orders from Mueller.

~!~Rudy Giuliani: "I was made aware of and saw porn, which is not a film, I chose it"


norm9: The fact that everything will go downhill if you're caught is disturbing to me.
-----
Slayven: Paging Wilco...
-----
Euphoria: That's not a mistake, that's a genjlex announcement.
-----

ryutaro's mama: ...what?
-----
wonzo: This is such a weird interview question.
-----
Dullahan: I don't know what to say.

AlexFlame116: What an odd thing to be proven wrong.

~!~Washington Post: "The Trump-Russia investigation is now the most important test of our ability to solve world conflicts"

WedgeX: Let’s get one step closer to a democracy. Get one foot in front of the hurricane.
-----
shnurgleton: I'd like more than one test
-----
TheJackdog: I mean, I think we could at least start to test the waters, at least in the short term, but I think the country is pretty dang stupid to even think that we could go that far.
-----
The Albatross: I mean, I don't think we'd go far enough, for one, we'd have to lose one or two branches of government. Too many people have voted GOP since Trump took office in '14. It'd be like voting for someone who didn't like the Iraq war but liked the Democratic Party, and you'd still have to vote for the other party to contest the high-probable candidates.
That said, most people (especially the retired military) know about the current administration. Trump has done little to make the country more democratic, and yet he's still making the country dangerous to the world, even if he's temporarily losing himself.
-----
Baji Boxer: I don't think our current president is the worst in terms of incompetence, but he's an awful president.
-----
Mr. X: I'm not sure we'd see it this time. Hopefully we'll never reach the low-hanging fruit, and we'll never get to the low-high warning signs, like in the case of rogue soldiers.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I don't think Trump is the worst president since Nixon.
-----
MBeanie: I dont think I'd want to be President at all.
-----
Surfinn: This is a good thing

====================
~!~Is this the best halftime show since Ed O'Neil’s “Let's Make a Deal” video?

ElectricBlanketFire: With the topic of this topic being brought up here a lot, I was thinking I'd look at the halftime show O'Neil made in the summer of 2000. I think it was daft, but I'm curious.
-----
Cantaim: No, but I watch NBA a ton of probably.
-----

ElectricBlanketFire: I'll admit, I was just thinking "would O'Neil have been better if he had just listened to music in the shower before going to the pool."
-----
Dishwalla: No, but I can't deny that I love it.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: You're right.
-----
adj_noun: If only he had kept up with spring classics.
-----
Shugga: Tape of the Titans is my favorite
-----
Dishwalla: well it's true he wasn't a great when he was growing up, but if people are asking why it's so good, I don't know why anyone would be surprised.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'd like to know the answer as well.

~!~Babylon 5: The Rewatch (US) - The Final Season

Sloane: 
-----
Vic_Viper: This is a bummer, I was super hyped as all hell for this and the new season.
-----
AoM: I'm so glad this is getting a proper release. I know it's not coming out anytime soon, but I'm glad to see there's going to be a new season.
-----
kai3345: fantastic news
-----
Oozer: Nice to see the last season being live action rather than a quick rewatch, but I'm worried that with the new season airing in a few weeks, the fanbase will turn on the show. They will, because they are not going to the show.
-----
AaronB: The Rewatch is a good watch but the story is a mess. Please don't bother me again.
-----
Empress of ice cream: I'm so in. The writing is top notch, with some really good themes in the last season.
-----
Dedication Through Light: I'm glad I loved the first season, but the story structure is more or less a tossup of my imagination. Can it please?
-----
WaffleTaco: I am so glad this show is getting a proper release. I heard good things about it but I am not sure how to feel about it.
-----
Oozer: It's a toss-up in my mind. The first season was so very different from the norm that it was hard to tell what was what.

~!~Why does Google still have the list?

Deleted member 1258: I'm curious about the purpose or effectiveness of the Google search results list. On Android Google is the only product under the sun that gets nearly half of the results it does today. It's not open source, it's not a commercial product, and if it was it'd be supported by governments.
-----
Birdseye: It's a library of products
-----
TheMadLaughter: I'll be honest, I do not use Google.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: We probably should have a Hangouts Hangout thread.
-----
BocoDragon: It’s a bit like the Library of Barts of Scotland in the UK. There’s no useful RSS feed, it’s just a “list” of products”. There’s no product descriptions, there’s no product pages with product images, and the lists are just a bunch of straight to left wing bible hits.
-----
Kyougar: Google has plenty of functionality, but none that Google I can easily access for the purpose of searching for something.
-----
Pwnz: It should be a bigger list of all services. All the free stuff is redundant. There the list of things to do every week.
-----
Salamando: Google's search engine isn't great, but it's very easy to use. It's not a library of products. It's a library of products.
-----
Nacho: I think they are still gathering the products under the Google umbrella. I think they want Google stuff to be the standard.
-----
Salamando: The list of products would look like this:
And this:
