For those that don't know, the article says he's been hospitalized for four days and underwent surgery.
Rest in peace and good health.

~!~Wonder Woman: Outsiders (new limited series) - Wed date (AMC World)

RatskyWatsky: This is a new limited series set to run for the rest of the year from creator Terry North.
Synopsis:
In NYC, Patty Jenkins joins the fray. A crime fighter who goes on missions to bring down the Skrulls, a deadly band of apocalyptic thugs and a womanizer (think: a police force with an out of control killer selling drugs), Wonder Woman must face her own set of hurdles: a mysterious death in Manhattan and an all-consuming desire to help her sister. Its all-star cast will be back, too...
In addition to the stellar visuals from the phenomenal debut of Justice League, Wonder Woman: Outsiders is set in the year 2099 when society as we know it is officially wiped out, as mankind goes into a new age of apocalypse and destruction. Based on the true events of WW1, the film follows the everyday struggle of the day and relays the events of the film's protagonist's murder in the present.
The film also features art from the DC comics, as evidenced by the figure above.
-----
Bor Gullet: Wonder Woman: Outsiders should be quite fun so I'll check this out.
-----
Ross62: I’m in
-----
Grunge_Hamster: I'm in.
-----
RatskyWatsky: Yup.
Maybe not a whole lot to choose from, but it's a fun ride.

~!~LTTP: Gotti (AKA Everything Sucks!): I watched 20 episodes and I'm pretty sure this show will be the next one to me

MosquitoSmasher: I just watched 20 episodes of Gotti and I am pretty sure that it will be the next one to me. I watched it for different reasons because I felt like I had a different reason to watch it (mostly due to the subject matter). I watched because I was really curious about people that don't usually watch anime and wanted to watch something different from what I had watched. 
I just feel like I noticed myself liking it a lot more than other anime I have watched, but I also feel like it was the most enjoyable thing I have ever watched (I think it is called Gotti 2 and it had a ton of stuff I liked but not the greatest things). I absolutely loved the premise and I think it is the most entertaining anime ever made. I also think the last episode is the best one because it actually end in a pretty good way. I really wish there was a thread for the 2nd season but I think there is not one. I do think I will watch the 3rd season but I don't think I have the time to do so right now. I do have a look at the first episode but I feel like I may have to take a break for a few days to check it out. 
Just wanted to get the sentiment across before I shit my pants. I think I might have to take a break from this anime for now, but I was wondering if anyone has a different opinion. I don't know that I dislike it at all but I have heard some people saying it pulls more punches than others. I just feel like it is the most over the top and immature anime I have seen in a while. 
PS: I will probably watch the 3rd season when the time comes. I just wanted someone to post it. 
PS: 
I also feel like I should say that I am enjoying the show. I have seen the 4th episode and think it is amazing, I am not the biggest fan but I thought it was an interesting premise and was a good watch.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: Yeah I don't think I can focus on that. I'm a big Gotti fan and it's what I have watched and understand it's a show that I have a soft spot for.

~!~Looking for a good rap/hip hop song.

Dali: I need some suggestions for a good Hip Hop song. I've seen a ton of good hip hop songs on YouTube and it seems there's a lot of good ones but I'm trying to stay away from too many. I'm a sucker for a good intro with a little variety. Something that has a bit of everything but also a bit of everything in it. Someone else will take some of my suggestions.
-----
torre_avenue: I just realized I made the thread late last night and that there's a whole YouTube channel dedicated to Hip Hop Music that has a good variety of songs, but a few I'm not really interested in. I was also just listening to a lot of good stuff the past few days, so it might need a more introspective approach. I'm still not 100% sure on what I'm getting myself into, but I'm open to adding some more stuff as the videos I saw so far seem to share the same aesthetic.
-----
acheron_xl: Nice, I'm a sucker for some funky production.
-----
Dali: What don't you have? It's so loud it drowns out the rest. That's what I'm trying to avoid.
-----
seat: Lyrics:
- "My brand is Lemon
What I call my taste? Lemon
On the grass is my grass, what I call my flavor? Lemon
On the trees is the root is the root, I call my flavor? Lemon
On the trees I'm drinking the juice out of the trees, where the roots come from?
What I call my taste? Lemon

Dai101: "Real life is a simulation

that's a very good song
-----
LifeLine: A couple of my favorites are:
-----
Dali: An electronic one, but not really much for me. I like some of the newer songs.
-----
Directed by Fulci: I like a lot of my rappers’ songs.
I think the best of them is a sort of dreamy-sounding one, but there’s something there, and it’s hard to describe. It’s like someone with a dream at this point.

Dali: I don't think so, I have serious trouble

~!~MoviePass is ending its affiliation with MoviePass.

Cpt-GargameL: I know for a fact the Movie Pass app has been pretty down for awhile and this is the first time I'm hearing about it.
The site also said they had plans to add In-Umbrella Movie Pass to the Movie Pass app but that didn't become a thing.
If this is true then I'm inclined to move on from the app and not pay for it.

~!~My cat just had a bout with the flu.

Gorgosh: I just had a viral the other night. It was like the most terrifying viral I have ever seen. My cat was lying on my bed, and for some reason I thought I was going to die. It was the most uncommitted flu I have ever had.
What the fuck happened? Is there a vaccine?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I don't know. I hope you have a speedy recovery.
-----

Gorgosh: Well there is this one. I think I am going to the hospital when I have to do this.
-----
Xiaomi: If it's an active respiratory infection, you should get the shot. Call in sick if you're not sure about this one.
-----
Gorgosh: I'm in a hospital. I just hope it's not my cat. He could have been a lot worse.
-----
Novoitus: That's awful
-----
Gorgosh: That the shot wasn't clear? I thought that was pretty easy to see.
-----

Bakercat: If you had a fever like me, you're all fucked. Get the shot.

~!~Beware of the Red Panda

Squarehard: I'm about to be kicked out of a bunkslam if too harsh on this part of the board.
So, Era, have you ever been kicked out of a bunkslam?
Have any of you experienced this before, or been given warnings, given this harsh thing that could happen in a situation?
I'm a brawler, and I'm almost certain I've been kicked out of a bunkslam, because I've never been a leader in any of these brawls, but I'm getting a MINUTE!
-----
Kuro: I was kicked out of a brawl for pointing out my uninvited guests to a moderator, he was right.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'm not sure I've ever been kicked out of a brawl. I think I've always been the one to initiate one, although I've been a bit reluctant to go out too much because of the odds.
-----
Subpar Scrub: I’ve never been kicked out of a brawl. I know the odds are insanely high, and I’m still a villain, though I’ve never been a big red panda fan.
-----
LegendofJoe: I've been kicked out of a brawl for pointing out the Joey Toaster to the other brawler that was a serial pest of feces and shit.
-----
FireSafetyBear: I’ve never been a villain
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've certainly been a villain, but I've never been a member of any of the brawls I've been involved in. I've always been a villain that was a severe offender, though.
-----
Squarehard: I have no idea what happened to me. Did he get banned from the forum or something?
-----
Elegant Weapon: I've never been a villain, but I've always been a member of the "pick your own 3rd strike team here"

~!~The Beat is the best album of the 2010s

TrailerParkRanger: I’ll just list my favorite “go to church” song of the 2010s. It’s not a good song, but it’s pretty awesome. 
I’ll try to be vague as possible, but I love this song. It’s my favorite upbeat “rock” song of the 2010s, and it’s so much fun. I’m honestly surprised this song isn’t even on any official “Official” release, since I’ve never seen it.
-----
Radiophonic: I don’t know if I’m being a glutton or not but the best Beach house album is Miracle Mile’s Rainbow Serpent.

~!~Nightcrawler is great

Anthony Hopkins: I've always been a fan of a good SciFi comic villain. Nightcrawler is so good. 
I'm enjoying his adventures so far:
-Necropolis, the city of gods
-Planet X
-The Comedian, Clockwork Orange
-Nightcrawler is great
What do you think about Nightcrawler?
-----
JK-Money: Dude is great in Deadly Class, anyone who loved Slade's Nightcrawler comic and liked the Comedian, even well-meaning, thought provoking posters on the Nightcrawler pages, is a fan of his.
-----
Anthony Hopkins: I think the artwork of Earth One was great.
-----
Empyrean Cocytus: He's great. I'm a fan of a lot of the book/game/comics.

Dullahan: I like him. I've had some issues with him in comics, but I love his design in the Deadly Class.
-----
PhantomKnight: He’s cool as hell and I’m always down for some Nightcrawler.

Edit: I don't know if this is the fault of the background check tech, but I think it could've turned up something useful here.

~!~Sports highlights that have stuck with you after a season or two?

Squarehard: Pretty much everything sports media related in this topic.
I'm talking about big, televised events that were televised in televised form in sports (sports baseball, football, etc.), and not sports baseball, football, football (soccer), etc.
What are the highlights of yours?
Here are a few I remember fondly:
Or if you want to add to list,
-----

Deleted member 37107: This is one I've never heard of (until recently). All about the Juve vs Roma match was fantastic.
-----
Vadara: The Los Angeles Galaxy vs Montreal Alouettes was a great one.
Also this is a good one:
-----

Funyarinpa: It's a match that's 20 years old.
-----
Squarehard: That was pretty much a complete omen to the Galaxy, Roma and LA Galaxy.
-----
Deleted member 37107: Spoiler: Some of these highlights are already on YouTube, but the ones that have stuck out to me are:
* This is the only one that involves actual goal, first score kick, etc.
* Jurgenson Robell vs Fabian Moreau
* Some of these are available on YouTube, but this is the one I remember most fondly.
* Some of these are not, but this is the one I watched most of the time.
* There is also this excellent clip from the Chappelle's Show that was available on YouTube available at any time during the season.
* There is also an amazing article from me from last year about how important the Dutch vs UK season to the soccer calendar.
-----
Squarehard: I just watched this one, and it's much more emotional than the first.

====================
~!~Movies that happened to your country or country's public image

Bung Hole: I would say the United States of America. For many years now, I have seen people go around criticizing every single film or tv show that came out or other country's portrayal. 
For example, some people say that George Clooney and Mirka from The Big Sick were too famous. Most people would have no trouble saying that Woody Allen or Woody Allen fame is too real. Or even people like former UK President David Cameron. 
So what other movies did people get into trouble for?
-----
Jombie: The first one I saw was Hard Sun by Bob Woodward.
-----
Gunny T Highway: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, the Hilarious, the Incredible, and the Life of Brian (let's be real, most people would rather give his name than his movie).
-----
Dishwalla: The Spy Game, A Song of Ice and Fire
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: I think The Lion King, The Wind Rises, etc
but I don't know which ones
-----
firehawk12: I've watched The Matrix trilogy twice. Both times I got on a bus full of people that would say something along the lines of "You are a piece of shit" or "You are a piece of shit."
-----
Transistor: The first one I watched was 2001. It's not even close to true, but it's entertaining enough.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: yeah, the second one was 2001 too, I think it was a movie about war, USA vs allies, other country fighting etc it was just a fun film to watch when I watched it with america
-----
Linkark07: 2001 is one of those movies that I remember in my mind when I was younger.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: it's not even close, but it's entertaining enough.

~!~Chick-fil-a is by far the best fast food chain out there

BAD: Chick-fil-a is the most diverse chain out there. They’re the most recognizable brands in the world.
Then again I never really thought about that Taco Bell monopoly where they were ahead of the curve fast. Now I’m not only talking fast-food chain, but fast-food places as well.
What are your thoughts? I can’t believe Chick-fil-a is still around.

~!~Weakest fear in human history: The fear of failure

fireflame: I am about to publish a book about my father that details 9 things that he constantly failed at. I have many other weak fears, and I find myself constantly thinking about them.
-He was never good at business, he was always a musician. He could never afford real estate. He wanted to buy houses with false promises of future earnings, and he could never understand the concept of future profit.
-He was always a gambler, always willing to gamble. He could never understand the concept of future profit.
-He lacked money and time.
-He hated his parents.
-He hated his siblings.
-He always wanted to be a professional actor.
-He was always lonely.
-He was always very afraid.
I have not read all of the books, I have read most of the newspapers, but I have seen some of the quotes, so I will give a list.
At 20, he was already a promising young man, but he was so much more. He had a really good job, with great grades. It was a very good job, really good job, with good pay. But he lied so much, with promises of future earnings, with a university degree. He could never understand the concept of the idea of future profit. And he was mocked by his parents for making promises of future earnings.
I am not sure if I would have let those fears hold me back. I would have found a job that promised me the kind of money I really wanted. I would have found a way to support him in his university education. I would have found a way to make my own life better, and my own life better. But I did everything I could to keep him alive.
I always felt sad for him.
I feel like I have no idea what to do, and I don't know how to fix it. It is not my fault, it is his fault.

Widdle Puppy: .

Mr. X: It's probably suicide. You could always try living with him.

~!~What Are the best films of 2017?

RatskyWatsky: I've been thinking a lot lately about how much the year's entertainment landscape has changed and how a lot of this has influenced the way we think about movies. I'm going to start with watching The Incredibles immediately; a film that's been on my top 10 movies of 2017 list for a while; and one of my favorite films of 2017.
It's a long list, so I'll open the top 10 with a few standouts:
Zootopia - A-movies-all-the-time
The Incredibles - The Incredibles is probably my personal favorite of the big family movies, and I can't think of anything more universally praised that's gotten me in particular. If you think it's a great film, then it's worth watching with someone who hasn't seen it.
Ralph Breaks the Internet - A huge Internet thread, but that's a close one.
A Bad Man - A movie with a lot of great reviews and a lot of good performances.
Patriot - A comedy only worth watching.
The Post - A good comedy movie, but it's a little too dark for my taste.
-----
MrToughPants: Great stuff
-----
Disco: I'll go with Fury Road, it's got one of my favorite director wins but it's not a movie I'd necessarily want to be disappointed in.
Not the GOAT tho
-----
TheBeardedOne: Only seen T2, and I didn't really enjoy it. It's a very different film from the first one, though.
-----
SageShinigami: I feel like I'm missing out on some stuff. The first one I watched was Mortal Kombat. I watched it again the same week I saw it. I'm quite into it, though.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I enjoyed Born to Die and The Grand Budapest Hotel although I have to say I didn’t enjoy The Grand Budapest Hotel.
-----
RatskyWatsky: The Grand Budapest Hotel is excellent. The rest I haven't seen.
-----
TheBeardedOne: The Post is good, but I have seen T2 and The Grand Budapest Hotel a bunch. It's good, but not great.

~!~Citizen Kane, The World's Ender

TheGamingNewsGuy: This is a fan made video for a new series where a community is made up of up to 10 citizens from around the world are casted as the main characters. 
If you don't know who Citizen Kane is, it is a psychological thriller set in a small fictional American town in the year 1800 that tells a sweeping psychological story about the world's oldest and most powerful democracy. There are six main characters and six major political parties. The main characters are John, the main political party that is set to last for around 1000 years, and Cheney, the lead personality that will likely be the next leader of the country. 
Here are just some examples of the themes presented so far:
-John is a tool, used by the ruling class in this town to make a statement to the local people and to the nation about their position in the world. The party is called Citizen Kane.
-The people are fed lies, manipulated by the government that manipulated them to keep their jobs and political party in order. John is a tool used by the ruling class in this town to make a statement to the nation about their position in the world, about which party they are voting for and how they will handle it. 
-The people are fed lies, manipulated by the government that feeds them lies that they can alter reality to make their lives better or worse. 
-The main characters are the main protagonists that is the main protagonist that lives a courageous and courageous journey to a better tomorrow. There is a core of truth that is hidden that goes deeper into the show about the relationships between the protagonists and the affects of the world that surrounds us in this world. There is a twist at the end about the main characters and it is very entertaining.
It is available to stream for free on the website. 
Note: I personally did not expect them to show any footage from the 1800s era when the story starts but the people who made the videos do not know what the hell is going on. 
Also i thought i was going to watch the entire series but streaming is not available in my country
-----
B-Dubs: I haven't watched it yet, but I'm interested in the premise, which is also based on a psychological thriller.

Pilgrimzero: 2 million people.
That’s a lot of stuff to cover with just a 2 million person in the mood for a story.
-----

Hollywood Duo: I’m assuming it’ll be 7 million people. At least not as many as Gotham ones.
-----
RastaMentality: i’m just surprised a show like this exists. i knew there’d be shit production numbers but seems like no one was clamoring for a modern series like this.
-----
HotsauceDragon: Saw this earlier. Altered Carbon is a show about a modern day Mariah Carey.
I have seen the original and the production values were not thrills or snappy. It's a good, fun show.
-----
Sober: I didn't see it mentioned like that. Had to double-check to see if it was mentioned. But I've read a few stories about how Joss Whedon had a massive hand in it and how he was heavily involved with it.
-----
Aurongel: Altered Carbon is a really fun show. I'm still not sure I would want an adaptation of this where I live.

====================
~!~I bought a used car. Need advice.

Threekola Miroswish: Edit: I don't know if its illegal, I bought it for my mom for Christmas.
I've got a 2016 Elantra, but I'm pretty old and most people recommend it to people younger than 18.
I bought it for my mom on Christmas Day as a birthday present. She's suffered a stroke and lost a ton of weight, so I figured we'd just wait and see if she had something worse to deal with, and then I would get back into the car.
While in the car, I heard a lady talking to me from behind saying "I knew a guy who had a car and was going to come over, but I didn't know he was playing music." I checked the driver's window and the driver's license number was on the windowsill, and the guy's license was on the seats, but no number was on the doors, according to my insurance.
I looked up the guy on the passenger seat and he looks like the guy I've been before. He was driving like an older model that had the sides rolled up, so no older than 75.
The front door opened and I could hear the woman saying "Hello, my name is Amanda" and then I hear a music studio hers.
Apparently this was the music studio my mom had me go to.
I grab my phone and dial the number on the passenger seat, and the lady said "Hello my name is Amanda" and then I hear her on the phone saying "Hello my name is john gdtiger and she has her own phone number so I will call her when I get home from work."
I said I don't really want to deal with that for now, but I'll get back into the car with her and give her the number.
I always thought this happened, I just never saw it coming either.
I don't want to deal with it for now, but I'm pretty sure I have enough money to renew it for the year ahead.

I'd be more likely to call someone.

~!~The Trump/Bannon conspiracy is back-alley!

Sagadego17: Just in case you didn't already know, CNN has been doing deep dives on the Trump/Bannon conspiracy with the help of ex Hillary employees. They have even been publishing the Hannity Audio recording of their coverage.
This man is not only insane, he is also a serial child molester and an alcoholic!!!!

~!~Amazon reportedly plans to provide a public service to offset the $18bn in Amazon Prime Video subscriber growth

KSweeley: This is insane. Amazon is publicly stating they will no longer provide a service that doesn't support Prime Video, and one of their CEO Jeff Bezos is reportedly stating they will implement a public service to "retire" from the public service:
-----
porkproduct: I've always thought Amazon Prime was a joke. I just recently discovered that they now offer a free tier. If I pay for it I get a package that expires in 3 days and I can just opt out or anything, but if I pay for the package in person and don't leave the house for a while the offer is forever.
-----
Figgles: The original article is way too long and it is likely fake.
-----
Gundam: I thought they'd have free prime for Black Friday.
-----
KSweeley: I never said I was going to get prime, but I think it is a huge overreach and I'm curious to know how they react to it.

Razgriz-Specter: Considering other things like the 9/11 attacks and Parkland, I am shocked.
The fact that it is happening all this outside the US just in the last 24 hours is alarming.

Cantaim: I just watched this on Netflix and I’m really impressed at how it’s directed and how it does an interesting story about kids growing up in a Paris context. Really fascinating show that does an amazing job of portraying the horrors of the Paris terrorist attacks as kids just growing up.
I’m going to start with my pick for the show: The French version. What I’m really referring all things considered. I’m personally really looking forward to it.

~!~Stargate is historical/political fiction. What is your take on it?

Mondy: So, in a lot of ways, I'm asking the fans of the franchise to discern which is 'historical' in some aspect. I think it's a lot of fun and I'm eager to hear some thoughts on which is more 'prestige' or 'sad'.
For me, I see the focus on the period from the Iron Age through the Napoleonic Wars, the development of the various forms of democracy, and the rise of the republic in the post-Medieval period.
I do think what I'm interested in is between those two extremes, I think the focus of the story is more about the characters and the world of their world, and the characters are historical figures, and the characters are sad, miserable, and useless as opposed to history's sad figures and experiences, while the protagonists are in a lot of ways a modern version of those characters. I'd like to hear from fellow fans of the Stargate franchise what you think, ERA.
-----
CormoranStrike: All the way from the US:
-----
Mondy: Oh, I know where you're coming from, but I disagree vehemently on the notion that the focus is too much on the characters, I think the focus should be on the characters in the same way that much of the Star Trek episode set on the Old West is set on New England.
-----
Hollywood Duo: The focus should be on the characters. The focus being more on the characters and the world of the characters.
-----
shnurgleton: The focus should be on characters, the more interesting things they do, the more likely the focus should be on the characters
-----
cirr: i'm seeing the "what's the point" answers and i'm wondering wtf you're coming up with and why you think you have to focus on characters
-----
WillyFive: The focus should be on the characters. The focus being more on the characters.
-----
stew: The focus should be on the characters. The focus being more on the characters.

Dice: If the writers want to point fingers and say "well, its not that big a deal" they can just go there.
But if the focus should be more on characters. The more interesting things, the more likely the focus should be

~!~Trump's third in-demand job, infrastructure job, and Fed job rollback

entremet: President Trump is delivering a third job in the infrastructure business: a revolving door for new jobs, according to four people familiar with the matter.
The president is expected to sign multiple times Tuesday and Wednesday, the people said, referring to the category of public jobs that are contingent on infrastructure, with several categories of such jobs moving around to other categories.
One big difference between Mr. Trump and his Republican predecessors is that the Trump administration is willing to roll back certain regulations as a way to promote investment. The Trump administration is still rolling out the tax reforms that started after the 2008 crash and has not yet rolled out the core of the legislation, but it will move to the full bill.
The president is expected to sign bills dealing with the federal departments, and he has been pushing for infrastructure projects as a way to boost economic growth.
But under President Barack Obama, the administration has pushed back on those projects, despite the fact the government has a specific job that is designed to promote job creation.
One example is the $1.6 billion project the Department of Homeland Security is building in Connecticut. The project was contingent on federal rules changes to improve the stormwater treatment system.
So, I wonder, is that a sign of Mr. Trump's realignment?
-----
NSA: He sounds like a NICK LOL
-----
Lumination: The president is fucking clueless.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: Oh cool, so he's going back and forth between "America first" and "America favors suburban sprawl" and almost always ends up being a nut.
-----
GK86: He will be a nut.
-----
entremet: Most of the jobs Trump likes. It's not like he went to them.
-----
hydrophilic attack: he's talking about his fucking dumbass
-----
andymcc: Dump is the GOAT of the Trump admin.
-----
The Albatross: That's pretty amazing, amazing. Seems like a typical doofus. It's a huge difference in the way we talk about the administration vs the actual person who actually runs the country. I love how they're just talking about all of the stuff Trump did, including his "economic policy" (I think I've dubbed that thing correctly, but the title of this topic says it's

~!~How do you deal with a hangover?

Hate: I'm not sure how many people have had long hangovers and it's something that has had a LONG history of their way of coping and it seems like every couple of months more people feel the same. Anyone else have an acute hangover?
I'm not sure how you deal with a hangover like most people, but I'm not sure if it's something you "just" have, or if it's something more natural. I'm not sure if a hangover on any level or if it's something you can "fertilize" on.
-----
Taco_Human: I had a hangover the other weekend and I ate like an adult...one time I got really drunk, went to work, and then the next day I woke up, and I had a full-body swim. It was intense.
-----
Taco_Human: Oh man, I have just come on here to say that I'm sorry for your loss and I do not want to hear that you're dealing with a hangover. I don't know how to deal with something like that, I can't imagine what it must have been like to endure that much. I am sorry for your loss OP. I don't know how to deal with something like that. I have no idea how to deal with something like that.
-----
Dest: I'm sorry for your loss OP. I have a hangover and I've been drinking for a few days and I feel awful.
-----
Seesaw15: I've had hangovers before but I've never had a hangover. I've also never had a hangover. It just seems like it gets more and more bad the longer you take these actions.
-----
johan: I tend to avoid alcohol unless I can prevent it getting in. It kinda sucks though
-----
Hate: I drink as much as I can and just deal with it, I guess that makes me a bad person, but I don't drink because I don't feel I have to, and I don't want to be consumed by alcohol anymore.

~!~What's the best style of beer you've ever had?

Thewonandonly: So I just finished watching kelpie and I had a good time with it but I don't drink much beer anymore. I guess I can't decide. Cause I've been let down by pretty bad. I don't even know what I'm talking about lol
But I was thinking about this and how the austin system is a bad idea if you have hard to get accesed to. Like if you're a die hard beer person who likes a good beer then you should like a good beer. Not necessarily a bad beer like lagers or whatever. But a good beer tastes good and if I like a beer I can enjoy it. So I got into some conversation with a friend about beer last week and it got me wondering what the best styles of beer are.
I mean I guess if I'm drinking I'm probably going to a shitty pub like Stone, Cigarrada or whatever. But I'm not quite sure what style I'm talking about. Like I can't really say what the best beer styles are. It's hard to say I've never had a good beer but I have no idea.
Which beer styles are good or bad. Or what is the worst. Let me know!

Zukuu: I love beer, but I don't drink it as much as a regular beer. There are a lot of good beers around that I just can't drink as much as I can because they are so damn expensive.
To be fair, I don't drink it as much as a regular beer or regular, but I do enjoy it. It's refreshing, but not quite as good as a regular.

fireflame: I was diagnosed bipolar a few months ago, so I am not sure if it is just another disorder or if it has something to do with stressor.
I am currently on dialer, so I don't know if it is a childhood thing or not.
In my case, I just think I am doing the right thing and pushing myself to do the right things, but it is so hard.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Sounds like it’s a form of depression.
-----
John Kowalski: It is normal and it's not something to be overcome with.

TheBeardedOne: Being overwhelmed by social problems is not something that is normal. Being depressed by stress is awful.
-----
SugarNoodles: Sounds like bipolar.
I’m able to feel better and I’m not in a crisis state.

FeliciaFelix: I feel like I'm always about 20% going through something, other than maybe a few days of feeling like shit.

tintskuecha: It's normal, yes. Some things are absolutely manic depressive, like if someone is diagnosed with ADHD or even autism it can be a symptom of that.

TickleMeElbow: I have a lot of bipolar.
I'm not a manic depressive person and I just feel like I don't have a choice when it comes to when overthinking my life.

Thewonandonly: So I’m a big fan of movies and tv shows like The Walking Dead and Atlanta so I’m about a mile away from starting The Crow and I’m just hanging out with a friend. Anyway Every now and then I’ll come across a movie that I want to watch but I’m really struggling with it. For example I want to watch the next season of The Wire but I’m a little afraid of going through with it cause of the “curse” part of the curse I’m not sure how I’m supposed to handle this part. Anyone else experience this? I’m just curious.

Thewonandonly: Bumping because I’m about to watch it once I’m in the area. Seeing the thread title reminded me how much I want to watch it but I’m not sure how to go about it. I’m just trying to figure out what part hits home and where I don’t want to go.

Cybersai: Do you mean series? Or movies?

Thewonandonly: I mean I just want to be able to watch it again

Fantastical: Yeah I’m currently watching The Walking Dead and like Walking Dead. It's pretty much a ritual for me.

Disco: I'm an awful person by nature of media. I feel like I'm just constantly being told "I don't want to watch this" 
I've seen basically everything in my life. I am always bad with the writing, directing, and acting of whatever I'm watching. Same goes for movies. I just watch stuff so I can mitigate the bad writing.

~!~Yesterday I learned that Michael Jackson died....

Imp the Dimp: I didn't know Michael was dead, I just learned he died in the UK today.
I learned about his death today by reading some of the condolable comments on Twitter by the people who knew him and saw photos of him in paintings. I learned that he had been suffering from dementia for over a decade and scientists had concluded that he died from Alzheimer's, and that he was dying from "more than a bout of high blood pressure."
To those who knew him, I wanted to ask you all what you think of Michael Jackson and how you felt of him as a person. Would you have believed that he was a loved member of the Royal family or a regular member?
-----
Mona: He was a great person, a realist, and he would have never left the stage I believe
-----
Socivol: I know someone who thought he was going to die in a Florida swimming pool and we knew it was a ghost story to some but then never cared.
-----
iapetus: I don't know his last name. I've never seen him at home.

xxracerxx: I didn't know he had Alzheimer's.
-----
Imp the Dimp: To be fair I did not care at all. I read the comments on his paintings and I thought he was pretty funny.
-----
Nerd_Incognito: I don't know if he was 100% elderly so... he was just a kid.
-----
Hobbesian Thudercat: Not to say he wasn't definitely a really kind person, but I wouldn't have guessed that he was in the stage of chronic wasting disease.
-----
Puck Beaverton: Michael Jackson was a huge influence on me growing up. I loved all of his movies and still watch some of them on a regular basis.
-----
Waddle Dee: Damn, I read him a book in 1972 when I was in middle school. An amazing book, but I'm not sure that it's the right one for that, because he's a grown adult and doesn't have a social life.

I've seen the pilot and it looks interesting.

TheBeardedOne: I'd still watch this.
I have a ton of old VHS tapes and was able to watch it with some great clarity.

~!~I found the Infinity Gauntlet in the Walmart Express Store. What do I get?

ElMexiX: So, I came across this Infinity Gauntlet in a Walmart store and while not the most obscure piece of geek paraphernalia, I was expecting something really amazing. Ordered and my GF wanted a small case for the case to hang on the shelf. She looked at the price of about $180 and thought it was a bargain. She looked me good and said, "You're getting it for $220 less."
So I went to Walmart and bought it and the case, and she was like, "I saw a sale on it for $175." I didn't take any time to research what is the most obscure piece of geek paraphernia I've ever seen, and I'm like, "Oh, that's what the $220 is?"
I'm like, "Nah, I'm good."
I got it set up for a couple of days and now I'm going to try it out in public and see it off
EDIT: I was thinking about getting the Spidey figure that came with it. I had one of the Spidey figures and it's pretty basic stuff, but I don't know if it'll make a big difference in my life?
-----
Alcotholic: How is this even a question?
-----
ElMexiX: I dont get it. She think it was a bargain?
-----
Sephzilla: It's probably not even a question.
-----
baggage: It's probably just the thing that happened to be stocked at the Walmart Express Store
-----
Airegin: Infinity Gauntlet?
-----
ElMexiX: I buy figures I think. I got them as a birthday gift in the early 2000s.
-----
Sephzilla: I had the Infinity Gauntlet figure as a kid and it was in my parents room in the early 90s. The comics I owned were referenced in the comics but I don't remember the comics I was told was made available to buy for $ in a store.
-----
Hollywood Duo: This is just a shelf design. The Hulk is obviously iconic and doesn’t count as part of a set or collectable.

Steamlord: So I've finally been doing some research, and I came across the search function for this site. Searching through the various options, I was able to come across this site populated with various options for the same movie:
The best option would be to purchase a digital copy of the movie. This would probably be the only way I'd personally be able to do it right, but it's definitely something I'd look into. What's the best way to do it? Any advice is much appreciated.

Jason Frost: Movies Anywhere is a premium streaming service. 
Check out Blu Ray.
-----
HououinKyouma: I'd look into digital subs. I've had trouble with the library of my choice.
-----
GrapeApes: Blu Ray.
-----
Praxis: I think in general buying movies is better than buying a digital version of the movie. That being said if you can spare the physical media for digital subs, it'd be a better option.
-----
HououinKyouma: I'm pretty sure I saw this thread before:
-----
Mona: just watch the movie
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I'd definitely look into a subscription. I bought a lot of movies in a subscription box. I go through and watch them on my regular cable box all the time. It's good for movies, but not worth the investment.

~!~Why do people fight?

SolVanderlyn: Anyone else feel like people fight? I'm pretty sure I believe that's a super healthy coping mechanism.
I get that it's a fun thing to experience, and a lot of the time it's also a really fun thing to learn about. I do it because there's always this other coping mechanism I'm really struggling to grasp.
I'm just curious if any of you fight, or if you just don't feel like fighting at all. If you did fight, why?
-----
Poppy: i fight for the sake of my friends and family

Wackamole: Cause i'm stupid.

TickleMeElbow: It's like fighting.

Widdle Puppy: Its been happening to me for a while and I've made some weird comments. I've thought about making a poll but haven't decided one way or the other.
What do you guys think about people who say they don't understand a word they just understand the word?
-----
SkyOdin: It's a social skill that allows you to say things that are easy to say but unintelligibly.
-----
Zoe: People who say they don't understand what a certain phrase or a word means are just ignoring it.
I don't understand how a word is interchangeable with "weird" or "it's a weird word to use in serious discussion"
-----
Widdle Puppy: I mean I live in the british-union area and understand what you mean but I don't understand the meaning of those words. Why does that sound forced?
-----
-PXG-: I understand what you're saying. But I do understand what you're saying.
-----
Brock Reiher: I understand what you're saying too. But I can understand what you're saying.

HylianSeven: When I was younger, I thought words were weird. Now? I'm pretty sure I understand what you're saying.
-----
The Great Khali: I understand what you're saying, but I don't understand what you're saying on the subject at hand.

Mona: You're probably right, I'm not really a reader of the comments so I don't really understand what you're saying.

~!~What is the best way to redeem yourself on Twitch?

TaterTots: I've been catching up on Twitch for a while and I'm curious what Era's view on this. I've watched less than a billion streams so far. What do you all think?
-----
Cybersai: 1. Twitch Plays Instead of Ganking Instead of Slacking Instead Of Disguising Instantly. I'm an introvert so I don't really see the point in it but it's pretty cool.
2. Twitch Plays Instead of Gaming Instead of Slacking Instead of Using Shut Up Like A Realist
That's pretty much it.
-----
TaterTots: Yeah I really don't see that point. But it's really cool.
-----
TaterTots: Okay, so I'm going to ask my viewers what they think about this. What do they think?
-----
Cyanity: I think Twitch Plays Instead of Ganks Instead of Talking Ganked
-----
Ryaaan14: Better than a lame ass chat chat

excelsiorlef: Ganks Instead of Shut Up Like A Realist

Mesoian: Ganks instead of using Ganked Instead of Talking Ganked Instead

Gattsu25: I just don't see the point. Twitch Plays Instead of Ganks Instead of Using Ganked Instead of Disguising Instantly is good.

HypedBeast: I love the Wire, Sex Education, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
What are some of the best television comedy episodes? I am curious if there are any shows that you have watched that you still would like to check out.
-----
BDS: I think the Wire is probably my favorite comedy episode of any medium, and I love Sex Education and Sex and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
-----
Socrates: Sex Education is great but you might want to watch two more episodes of that.
-----
lazygecko: I really like Sex Education and Sex and Brooklyn Nine-Nine so I can't say I really perma
-----
HypedBeast: I'm not sure if it's really my fav, but I love The Wire and Sex Education.
-----
Socrates: I'm not sure. I remember watching it and thought it was bad.
-----
HypedBeast: I don't know if I've seen Sex Education OR Sex and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.
-----
Galkinator: I loved Sex and Brooklyn, but the Sex Education episode was the highlight. I also loved Sex Education and Sex, too. I also loved The Office too, although I never watched it.
-----
HypedBeast: I think people don't like The Wire because it's a different style of comedy. It's my favorite comedy of all time, I think.
-----
BDS: It's The Wire, but I'd say even The Sopranos is better than The Wire.

~!~5 Years Ago Today, The Day Before Christmas (1977 Movie)

Dook's Revenge: I haven't seen this in a long time, but I remember the original being one of my favorite Christmas movies.
I love these special feature films. The early 90's cartoon feature films like The Barber's Daughter, and the original Star Wars. The first Indiana Jones movie was also a classic.
I remember being excited about the 70s or early 80s cartoons that were spawned by this movie.
Why didn't I watch this in the theater?

~!~How do you think Marvel Studios will handle the Fantastic Four/Beast Wars cinematic universe?

guek: After Solo and the Fox sale, I think Marvel Studios has a sale to hold on the Fantastic Four universe. They've got a Transformers film coming out in October, a Thunderbolts film already in the works, and a Fantastic Four film coming out in 2020. The Fantastic Four films are the next big thing on the Disney banner to be released. All three films are supposedly being made in association with Marvel Studios.
But what do you think the MCU will become like? What do you think will be the end of the MCU? What are your hopes/dreams?
-----
Slayven: According to rumors they are looking into bringing back the X-Men
-----
Anth0ny: Marvel didn't buy Marvel at all, they got them for the cheap price of 20 dollars each
-----
Gwenpoolshark: I'm sure they'll cave and buy them all.
-----
Sephzilla: I'm telling you what, they're already on their way out and your hype train is about to be replaced eventually.
-----
Rackham: They're already there, that's just what the deal was
-----
Buckle: I dont see why they would want to kill off the X-Men if they can just kill off a billion superheroes that are already there and have no subtext to them.
-----
Sanjuro: Marvel didn't buy them. They got them for the cheap price of a few dozen Spider-Men toys.

Cap G: I wonder, just how creatively fucked are they? Are they already dead?

-----
G_Shumi: On this episode:
On the last episode, I think he's really struggling with the writing. The way he wrote it is just bad.
-----
louiedog: This episode is all uphill from the last episode. It's just a complete mess.
-----
The Almighty Tria: He's getting back into writing and directing a movie about his friend Roy Moore, so I do hope that is a sign of things to come from him.

~!~Era, what are your favorite retro games?

NTGYK: Mine is a mash-up of a bunch of games that are retro and modern (as far as I know, they're not mutually exclusive), and different as a way of making the overall approach more accessible. It's not what you think games the 90s and 00s should be, but what you actually like.
What are your favorite retro games?
And what are your favorites at all?
-----

Tethered Penguin: I like them all.
I've been pretty much a Sega fan ever since I first laid in my crib.
-----
The Kree: I'm not sure how I feel about this. 90's/00s games shouldn't be retro, because they're such outdated pieces of cod, manuals, manuals that are outdated they're obsolete, just because they're not being played on modern systems.
Actually, I'd say most of the retro games in my collection are retro. Not everything has to be a Sega or Saturn, but some are classic and some are classic and a classic, and some are retro as hell.
-----
BAD: I don’t really care for them, but have fun with em
-----
jizzywinks: The only choice. The 90s were a mistake
-----
DrFunk: "My wallet is a mess!"
-----
Kasai: They're all great but I've been too lazy and salty to buy one for the last few years because I hate retro
-----
Lotus: I've never understood the appeal to them.
-----
WaffleTaco: I’m really only looking for games that are played on a modern computer, but not games that are timeless. There are a lot of games I would consider to be classics if they weren’t so damn expensive.

~!~The Best Evangelion (1995) DVD and Blu-ray combo available

jack_package_200: I own all the DVDs, but wanted to specify that the BR is the best in my opinion, but I would love them to box art. They were never released anywhere other than retail or as gift. 
I'm not sure if I would buy an BR, but it's not like I would get a BR without the BR.
-----
Ampersands: The complete collection is available on Blu-ray.com
Also, I bought a BR on Amazon.com. Did not transfer everything to it.
-----
Krejlooc: I think the closest to what the BR is is the DVD, but I'm not sure how the rest of the series compares because the Blu-rays look almost the same in their aspect ratio.
-----
The Albatross: I just bought the complete set of the complete series on amazon.com today. I'll probably do a trial on blu-ray.com sometime in September (pretty sure I'll have to buy the BR), and the BR is a good option.
I don't remember the disc, but from the description, it looks like it's a-lookin'-to-own-with-no-name-accounts-in-the-world. It's a rough idea of what it's like, so I'll probably just grab it and try it out.
-----
Sagroth: I just recently picked up the complete set of the complete series on blu-ray.com. It's definitely the best I've ever bought, and it has everything I ever wanted.
-----
The Albatross: I plan to buy the BR at some point in time, but it's a wonder that it's only a collection. I'm not sure about the other combo sets (I'd like to have one I own, but not sure how much is worth buying), but the only blu-ray I've streamed is Dragon Ball Z Abridged for free (which only has 5 episodes), so I'm willing to give it a shot if I can.
-----
Dali: I just recently picked up a BR collection on Amazon.com and I like it a lot.

Einchy: The complete series is available on Netflix. It's not terrible, but it's not the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

Yeah, but I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think it's a war to keep us all in camps. The Democratic party is full of Nazis, sure, but they're not actively complicit. And I think that's fair enough. But the fact that they're actively trying to kill us is a damn travesty. We're actually living through some horrible shit right now, so any one else, I dunno. And the fact that they're purposefully trying to kill us shows how far we've come. The fact that they're actively trying to kill us shows that they're aware of the crimes they're going to commit.

~!~China to launch orbital precision fighter, capable of targeting the US with metadata of all incoming missiles

AcademicSaucer: The world’s most advanced fighter jet will undergo a major overhaul in design as China has announced plans to create a new version of its most powerful surface-to-air missile capable of targeting the United States with metadata about all incoming missiles, a Wall Street analyst has found.
China is expected to enter a trade war with the United States over the use of its new fighter jets. The fight will be won or lost, but the battles will be won, the analysts’ research found.
China has launched a number of advanced fighter jets, some designed by Russia or China, but the Pentagon has seen them slipping towards the US with the fleet, and defense industries have seen them slipping towards the end of their prime testing program.
“The missiles are slipping towards the US, but the tanks are up there,” said Michael Vachon, chief executive officer of Vanguard, a credit rating agency. “The battles will be won.”
China’s military spending has soared since the end of the Cold War,”Mr. Vachon said, adding that while military spending has bounced between 5 percent and 20 percent in the past, its military spending has bounced back home.
“The reason is China has spent more and spent more and’s more, and they’re recovering from a military renaissance that thawed the political debate over Taiwan, the status quo in Beijing’s sphere,” Mr. Vachon, who wrote the report, said.
China has been using fighter jets to fly bombers to the International Humanitarian Exchange Force, or HIFC, a Chinese military wing that is responsible for providing refuge for refugees and migrants on U.S. soil.
The new planes are being manufactured by Bombardier, which has been developing new fighter jets for the past decade. The new planes will be able to land in hypersatmospheric altitudes, including those intended to be launched from the Sun.
“The HIFC’s new approach is the world’s most powerful launch launch platform,” Mr. Vachon, who oversaw the new launch series for the Pentagon, wrote in an article for the Wall Street Journal. “The advantage is, at the end of mission, the HIFC is more sophisticated than before and

~!~I'm doing something - Any tips/experiences?

entremet: Just started my first online podcast (~20 episodes) and I find I'm doing a lot of listening. I also listened to a lot of YouTube music lately. I've read some, watched some things, but nothing really made sense.
I'm not sure where to start. I've started as a hobby but don't know where to start. I'm a very social person so I like to socialize. I don't know if this is a good idea or not (it's just a first step!). I'm on a YouTube show but don't know how to make it work. I'm not sure if there are any podcasts that are closer to the scope of what you're looking for.
I'm also not sure if I'm doing anything worth listening to. I just started on a world tour but I'm not sure if I'm doing anything worth listening to.

Bookoo: I don't know the specifics, but you do you. It's fun. I started out on a How To make a Podcast series with a friend and I ended up loving it.

TarpitCarnivore: Listening to podcasts is like listening to listening to a youtube video. I don't know. You just have to find the right mix for your tastes. The best way to listen to podcasts is to start with with a mix of podcasts, then work your way up to the source of the podcast.

Are you feeling it? Are you bummed about it? Is it grim? Are you bummed about it? Discuss what you're feeling.

Cybersai: I don't feel sad for the characters.
I feel like they had a purpose.

Bor Gullet: I think ending is a big part of the charm of the series.
I feel like there was a lot of "hit-and-run" moments throughout the series, and the ending was a big part of the charm.

Bear: I felt the ending was completely wasted on a terrible rewatch. The only thing that could've made a good ending was for me to rewatch the series after I'd seen the ending.

Masquerade Overture: It's the best film adaptation of the manga.

shira: Why is the movie Big Thunderstruck changed?

~!~Best fictional mystery in media.

Deleted member 1378: I'm starting to realize how much media has a fictional plot in it. The way I look at it, it's a story that's told by somebody. You're following them, they're telling the story.
From Gone with the Wind, to Conan the Barbarian, to Harry Potter. I see too many stories tossed into it.
What are the best of these series?
-----
Richter1887: Ichinese Scrab House
-----
SigmasonicX: The mythbusters puzzle in Smash Bros.
-----
BDS: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
-----
Rad Bandolar: There are a lot of popular ones that I think are overrated. There's a recent one that I think is pretty good but I have trouble seeing it being considered seriously.
-----
Grexeno: There are a lot of popular ones.
-----
iosefe: I think the one in MGS.
There's a whole gaming community thread that very much is a good example of a "manga thread".
-----
Bio: The Truth About Janet
-----
Lonely1: In D A D E
-----
RedBlue: There’s a lot of media that has some good lore in it.

====================
~!~Why is it that anime music videos get more views on YouTube?

L Thammy: I don't know if this is just YouTube talking, but I've seen a ton of anime music videos get more views on YouTube than other media, and I just can't get why something so popular can get so many views, it's just so irritating.
-----
Kthulhu: It's because the people who watch the videos are either too old to keep the music active, or just don't like it. They like it because they want to get their hands on it and enjoy it.
-----
Einchy: I used to be a huge anime fan back in the day. But I absolutely hate anime.
-----
jwk94: That's a really weird question OP. I don't understand the question.
-----
BreezyLimbo: Because anime music is just too boring to get engrossed in, and anime has too many repeats and filler?
-----
Sandfox: Because anime has too many times that it's just generic music.
-----
Dai101: Because people are tired of the anime.
-----
sir_crocodile: because anime videos have too many times that it's just generic music
-----
Bobo Dakes: Because it's more interesting then getting into the world of the video itself.
-----
Dekuman: Because anime has too many times that it's just generic music.

~!~The Leader: There is no 'true democracy' in the US.

lidmat: The Leader of the Free World:
The Leader of the Free World:
The Leader of the Free World:
-----
Tunesmith: I agree. The US should never be in a position to actually be in a democracy.
-----
Steel: The US should never be in a democracy.
-----
Aselith: I mean, we have the mythbusters and Trumpers who say we shouldn't try, but the reality is that 'true democracy' is just a lie.
-----
Piston: This is not correct.
Trump is not in a democracy. The GOP is in a democracy.
-----
UberTag: It's very possible that Trump is in a serious, substantive democracy that's separate from politics.
The GOP and the Democrats are both just as bad and/or complex as the current system that the American electorate is elected to.
We've been elected to serve mankind in a vaguely similar manner, and we've been shown to be far more susceptible to manipulation than the current left.
I know that's not true, but it's still true.
-----
TheLostBigBoss: Most likely yes

====================
~!~I just saw a super hero movie.

DongBeetle: It was a good movie. My wife liked it. I was sad with the end :x
I'm going to watch it tonight. I'm not even sure what I thought of it when I first saw it. I thought it was a good movie. I'm not even sure what I fell down into. It just hits on the basic premise of a superhero movie.
-----
Lopez: I thought it was good.
-----
zoggy: Would probably watch any other movie.
-----
kurahador: It's a fine movie, but it's super fails.
-----
Ferrs: This is why you do not go to a movie showing good movies.
-----
BDS: There isn't a great one. They're all super hero movies, regardless of genre. Not even a Batman movie, just a Superman movie. This is not a film that gets any appreciation.
-----
Mona: the only superhero movie i watched was marvel by a small margin
it's a very good movie, but it's super hero movies
-----
cj_iwakura: It's not exactly all that great. It's not a great movie, but it's a very good movie.
-----
Raptomex: I watched it when it was airing on Toonami. I was shocked that they ended up doing this with a movie that was so popular. I loved the premise and the premise of the movie and it was very entertaining. Very similar to Daredevil.
-----
DongBeetle: I was surprised by that as well. I thought it was good. I had fun reading the synopsis. I loved it
-----

====================
~!~Agent 47 (Toby Young) to play a serial killer in a never ending story

Scullibundo: I'm also excited for a more traditional occult story. I like the idea of a detective story, but I'm in for Young. 
I don't know if it's going to be a book, but I'm looking forward to it.
-----
Medalion: I'm already behind Toby Young, but I'm in for Young. I'm huge Young fan, and I've really enjoyed the books.
-----
Cheeze: I read the first and third of them and enjoyed them quite a bit, not so much the latter, but the first.
-----
Scullibundo: It's a fantastic book. I don't know how I'd feel if I watched a movie.
-----
Blader: I guess I'd have to reread the whole series to see what kind of monster he's playing.
-----
Scullibundo: Why not? The first book was the pinnacle of occult fiction.
-----
sphagnum: Not gonna lie, I didn't really enjoy the first book but I'm down to read more as my main reading for the next couple of months.
-----
FlowersisBritish: I'm so down for this. I've heard the first book is foul, but I'm pretty sure it's a Lovecraft story.
-----
Soundscream: I have a soft spot for works that are more "pure" occult in nature like stories about the lost city of Erom.
-----

====================
~!~Disney didn't buy Fox Searchlight for Xmas

ManaByte: So this Disney didn’t buy Disney songs until after they had already bought Fox. Now we can all celebrate!
-----
BDS: Disney didn't buy them for Christmas. It's not like they didn't buy Xmas, but they didn't buy Xmas either.
-----
ManaByte: I think you're thinking of M&Ms and other merchandise.
-----
Llyrwenne:

~!~Can we Fix That One Tweet That Made No Sense

TaterTots: Been meaning to make this thread for awhile so I decided to make a thread. Warning, this thread contains links to stuff that may contain links to things that may contain links to links that may contain links to things that may contain links to things that may contain links to things that may contain links to things that may contain links to things that may contain links to thoughts. 
I don't know. It's a fairly significant story, in my opinion. I just don't know what to think of it.
-----
BWoog: Nah, I don't care about that one tweet. It doesn't really matter. It's just embarrassing.
-----
Coyote Starrk: It also doesn't really matter.
-----
The Kree: That one tweet is one of the most ridiculous examples of "what not to do" I've ever seen. 
It's all fucking shit.
-----
xxracerxx: I don’t understand this tweet.
-----
H.Protagonist: I don't know, OP. That tweet is just so bad. If you didn't know that, that would make sense.
-----
LewieP: I think it's pretty bad.
-----
adj_noun: I think a lot of what the OP says applies to this specific tweet.
-----
TaterTots: I don't know, but it really is a bad example of "what not to do". That tweet is bad, but it's a very notable example of how bad twitter is.
-----
BreezyLimbo: The tweet is bad.
But it's not the WORST example.
-----

====================
~!~What is your favorite movie of 2018?

ElectricBlanketFire: My answer would be...
The Last Jedi.
-----
TheJackdog: first post nails it. post your answer
-----
Christian: I’m not sure I’d put Avatar on this list, but I’ll flip it.
-----
Gundam: 2001 easily.
-----
Prophaniti: Best first post on resetera
-----
Smurf: it's a toss up between The Matrix, Terminator 2, and The Lord of the Rings
-----
The Sum of Zero: The first two movies are pretty boring and I don't know why.
-----
Gundam: 2001 easily.
Tetra-Grammaton is a god among man.

jkm23: No answer.

====================
~!~Who is the best MCU villain of all time?

StuBurns: I nominate Nebula.
What is the MCU villain who has the most impactful, memorable, and entertaining villain of the MCU?
Spoilers for the films, don't worry, just like in Lifeboat, don't worry about Spoilers, this is not about Spoilers 2, don't worry about Spoilers 3, don't worry about the Infinity Gauntlet, etc.
My vote goes to Winter Soldier.
I can't think of anyone more deserving of this honor than anyone else. The genius tactician, the tactician he hired, the tactician who had the secret to stopping Winter Soldier, the tactician, the scallywimmer, and has even managed to kill Winter Soldier at the cost of time. He has Costner on his team, and the second-in-line on his body. He is capable of making Winter Soldier look like a fool. He can at least draw on the strengths Spidey had at Winter's command, like when he got the symbiote from the symbiote that is Winter, and then placed a little puppet that is Winter in Winter's Captain Marvel costume.
-----
Gundam: I think Iron Man is the most iconic MCU villain, but if Cap is the best of the MCU, then I think he's the most interesting of the MCU.
-----
John Kowalski: I think the best MCU villain is actually Cap.
-----
Dio: Thor's design is brilliant.
-----

Gundam: Cap and Thor are better than Nebula or even Winter Soldier.
-----
LewieP: I love Nebula, but Cap is the best. Nebula is my pick too. 
That's a shame I don't like Nebula at all, she's a good villain and she's interesting, but Cap is amazing.
-----
Rackham: Cap is the best. Nebula is pretty much the only Marvel villain I enjoy. Everyone else is just garbage. 
Iron Man is the best, but Nebula is good too.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: I mean, I can't really think of a villain more iconic in the MCU than Cap, but the rest are all just as good, if not better. I think Iron Man is the most interesting, Nebula is the only.

~!~What's the most you ever spent on an Italian meal?

Rivenblade: I just spent $10 on an Italian meal, and I expected to regret it a lot. I had some bread and cheese, but instead I got this, which I expected to be a savoury pasta sauce.
So I ask you ERA, what is the most you ever spent on an Italian meal?
-----
rude: $100 on a tres leches. I’m sorry.
-----
Lopez: $30 for food and wine
-----
Teh Hamburglar: $100 Italian meal
-----

tadale: $50 for a gift.
-----
Jbourne: A "tumble" loan of $50, which was less than I spent on one meal.
-----
Nerfgun: $50
-----
Rivenblade: I don’t think I’ve ever spent a cent on anything for dinner. I’ll get that, but I’m sorry.
-----
Shugga: $50 
LOL

~!~If you had a friend... who would they be?

Deleted member 1258: This is a question that I think a lot of people have, and I'm curious to see what people think about the person. My friend is currently in a situation that should probably end with him permanently placing an hold on his student loans. If you had a friend who passed, what would they be?
Edit: To clarify, this is about an individual. I'm not saying they should be a friend of that person.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: If I had a friend, I'd be part of the "it's not my fault if they didn't get what they wanted, share of the world, or whatever" crowd.
-----
Bronx-Man: My mom on the show “talks tough.”
“You don’t get a lot of options,” she said. “If you have your own way of doing things, you could be doing better, but if you’re stuck somewhere, nobody knows how to do that.”
-----
Pirate Bae: My mother and step-grandfather. They were my best friends and have been a part of my family ever since.
-----
Travo: Same. My uncle had a friend that I had a good relationship with. I don’t remember him at all.
-----
Cybersai: Isn't that the same person that had a friend that I did not like?
-----
Dio Over Heaven: I'm not saying they would be a friend of mine, but I have a friend that I dislike, but I wouldn't mind being one. I'm not saying I'm not jealous of the person, but I understand being a friend is important, and I get the point.
-----
Duxxy3: This.
-----
Bakercat: My parents. I’m a big conservative and I’ve never had a friend that I didn’t like. I’m not a big fan of “other” people, nor do I think that being a friend is a big deal. I’m just a good dude and I’m just there to help people.
-----
Br3wnor: I’m graduating soon and have a friend in Florida who’s been there since I was 5

~!~Is it time to stop watching TV?

Dalek: I just had an argument with my girlfriend about this and I found this interesting:
I think the era of widespread TV availability is pretty much dead, but I'm wondering if any of you have a case of chronic watching addiction that would be expected.
-----
Mcfrank: Yes.
-----
Dio: yes.
-----
TheBeardedOne: No. I don't.
-----
fick: I stopped watching it after the first season of Daredevil. I don't want to watch it ever again.
-----
Dice: I'm not saying I'm going to watch but I'm curious if it's ever a problem for anyone else.
-----
TheBeardedOne: What? That's horrible. I think I watched a lot, but not enough to do anything worthwhile with it. It's too much of a distraction from my work.
-----
Sectorseven: I'd say it's kill time now.
-----
Bobo Dakes: It's not like they're going to obsess over everything they do, they'll just sit and read online and pretend they didn't watch TV.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Kinda?

Trojita:

capitalCORN: Twitter is a shit lot of baddies.

The Last Wizard: What the fuck is going on in the Twitter system?
-----
cdyhybrid: Twitter is not capable of handling all responsibility. It'll take time for it all to wash off.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Will this affect the stock options?

FantasticMrFoxdie: GO FUCK YOU

Yes, the app is free. No, I don't know.

~!~What are some good hiking boots?

Dali: I'm looking to get a pair of white shoes since I'm getting older.
I don't really like boots, but I liked the Cloudcoat ones.
-----
Doom_Bringer: I use the Loggers when I go hike in Colorado. It's just the basic white shoe you can get with the regular shoe.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: This is a good hiking boots.
-----
Dali: Haha, don't go hiking.
-----
Dook's Revenge: I like the White Wolf.
-----
JigglesBunny: I’ve been using this one for about 2yrs now. It’s been great for the most part, but I’ve had more runs than miles.
-----
Dali: It's the Loggers white shoe, not the Cloudcoat.
-----
TheChuggernaut: I've been using a pair of these since last December. I specifically chose the Cloudcoat because it was a lot more breathable and would last a long time in the cold. The Cloudcoat also seems to work better with hiking in it. 
They are a bit more comfy, but not a deal breaker.
-----
Carthago Delenda Est: I've been using the Cloudcoat for almost 5 years now. You're probably fine with getting a pair since it doesn't seem to do much of anything and is less likely to crack or be too wrinkly.
-----
Dali: I was going to say it's the Cloudcoat, but I'm not a huge snow person.

~!~What is this scene from The Wizard of Oz?

Mezentine: Saw this on youtube and had to say it was one of the most bizarre sequences I've seen in a movie (handcutter).
-----

Kevers: I don't believe in the Oz legend but this scene is amazing.
-----
Kasai: That's what Lordy of the rings is about, that's brilliant.
-----
Mezentine: I love that scene!
-----
The Kree: Looks like a lot of fun.
-----
The Kree: It's the best.
-----
Kevers: That's a shame I'm glad I never saw it.
-----
The Kree: To do that you have to go to the Museum of the Ozymandias in New York and go to the Egyptian tomb and there's a statue of Ozymandias, the creator of the Gods head.
-----
Mezentine: It's pretty accurate too

====================
~!~Marvel's Infinity War - What will happen to the MCU in 10 weeks?

MasterYoshi: A discussion came up on Twitter regarding the upcoming 10-13 weeks of Marvel's Infinity War, and I thought it would be interesting to ask the community what they think of this event.
First, a few observations:
- It will be interesting to see what happens with the Avengers vs. The Avengers in 9 months.
- They will likely see the fallout for Infinity War as a "kill" for Thanos and the Avengers in 9 months, while Avengers in 7 months.
- The Avengers will probably show up in Phase 4.
- The Phase 7 Avengers will probably be in the Avengers in 9 months.
- Avengers will probably end up in the Avengers in 7 months.
- The Phase 8 Avengers will probably be in Avengers in 6 months.
- It's likely that Thanos "in 9 months" will have been defeated in Avengers in 7 months.
- Thanos in 6 months would be a "defeat."
Also, it's likely that the Avengers, Avengers 1 and 2, and Phase 3, will be in Avengers in 5 months.
So, what will happen to the Marvel universe in 10 weeks?
-----
Khanimus: It'll be a "kill" for Thanos in Avengers.
-----
subpar spatula: Avengers movies will be mediocre.
-----
Fury451: It'd be a "kill" for them for Phase 3.
The Avengers will be a "say/hey" for the first half of it, but I think they'll be removed from the MCU for Phase 4.
-----
shira: Avengers: Infinity War won't be 3 what they are getting
-----
Khanimus: It's not even the first time they've went in 9 and said "This is the last Avengers!"
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Avengers: The Last Avengers
-----
LukarWuff: It’ll be a kill for them for sure, but I think the fact that they’re going to have to deal with a new enemy after the Infinity War is going to be the real "kill" for them. I’m so glad they’re going to be done with the MCU, because I really do think they could pull it off.

====================
~!~Under the Silver Lake: Auralnauts' New Animated Series

DiscoPizza: I'm not much of a scientist or scientist myself but I'm pretty excited to see what Auralnauts is up to. 
I'm a huge fan of the classic anime - The Aristocracy. I watched it in the 90s as a kid, but I never got the whole thing over with. I just watched the first season on Netflix, and I'm not a huge fan of the animation style. My favorite part of the show was the opening, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's not good, the show has parts that really don't do anything for me to feel like I'm watching a re-telling of a classic anime, but the animation is so good that I can't really complain.
-----
PantherLotus: I actually really enjoyed this show. Not sure why it's mostly stuck with me, but I agree with the sentiment of the video below.
-----
Igniz12: It's great but I agree with the video above about the animation style. I watched the anime years ago but I don't remember quite as much as I do now.
-----
Neptonic: I can't believe I've never heard of this show
-----
TheCthultist: I’ll have to watch this.
-----
Ferrs: I enjoyed it still but it's not the greatest anime that I've ever seen. I'm not sure if I expected it to be or not, but I saw it in theaters. Horror movie-ish like a lot of things but just a horror movie kinda movie.
-----
LionPride: It's worth it for the artstyle and effects and the fact that the premise is a retelling of the most famous HxAn arc which is also an HxAn arc
-----
Igniz12: The video doesn't mention the arc in the anime, but if it's anything like the other HxAn arcs, it's because they're HxAn arcs that were already out when they came out.
There are other arcs, like the one with Morgan Freeman and the another with Peter Parker, but this one is the one I love the most.
-----
MrSaturn99: I watched it last night, a friend recommended and we're seeing it tomorrow. The animation is top-tier.

-----
Slayven: The only pair I know of that's hideous is the old white ones
-----
Powdered Egg: It's ugly as all hell.
-----
signal: I don't know if they're hideous but the branding has got to be hideous.
-----
Dishwalla: I mean this is a pretty shitty shoe, but the new white ones are pretty hideous. I think they are a bit closer to the nike version but I dunno.
-----
Dekuman: They are really ugly
-----
andymcc: lmao
-----
Aquavelvaman: They're hideous as fuck
-----
Cocolina: They're batshit

~!~What's the best way to use an iPhone 6S Plus?

Josh378: So I got an iPhone 6S Plus a few days ago and I'm pretty happy with it. I've never had an issue with the software or the price of the phone, but I'm not too happy with my use of an iPhone. It's so much more for the convenience and health of it, and I think I'd like a Plus 6S Plus, but I'm worried about its security, and I'm happy with how it is, but I'm not sure how to feel about it. I'm also concerned about the battery life, which is really high when compared to previous iPhone models.
-----
Bold One: I use the iPhone X on my everyday use.
I’ve had the Plus 3 for about 3 years now and I just wish it was on par with the latest models with the same battery. I wish it was better in every aspect, and the screen and camera is great
-----
Jie Li: I use an iPhone on the subway and a Moto e4 on work wifi.
-----
Jie Li: I didn't realize the battery was so cheap. That's an upgrade for both my use.
-----
Biggersmaller: iPhone 8+. I like the screen, but it's nowhere near as good as the S plus.
-----
TheAbsolution: I've had the Plus 3 in the longest time. It's so good.
-----
DJ_Lae: I have a Plus 3 in my hand, and I can say with complete earnestness that I find it to be the best phone in the industry at least. It's not a phone everyone buys outright for the slap on the wrist, but an extremely capable and good phone. Just be prepared for the exchange.
-----
maxxpower: I've had a Plus 3 in my hand, with faster charging, better screen and battery and an even more capable screen when it first came out. 
I've also had it in my pocket, but I wouldn't compare it to the S plus.
-----
AHA-Lambda: iPhone for the price
-----
Biggersmaller: $800 for a 256 gp screen, the plus screen is even sharper.

J_Viper: Looks really good, I'm really looking forward to it
-----
Protome: Was it filmed from the script or from someone else? I remember hearing about it on the run but I don't remember if it was actually real or it was some elaborate fake edit or something.
-----
Fantome: I think it was an edit of the original novelization.
-----
Praetorpwj: I’m so in. This movie is some real shit.

~!~How do you deal with eating leftovers?

FernandoRocker: I've had leftovers for dinner (tomatos, salsa, peppers, tomatoes, cheese, onion, peppers), but I don't want them to become spoiled. I've been cooking for a while now and I've just noticed that I eat them right away.
I just noticed that after cooking a lot of cooking I don't realize how much time I actually have left over. You're cooking right now, but they're leftovers. Is this normal?
-----
Travo: I eat leftovers when I feel like it.
-----
Cocolina: You don’t care. You can eat whatever you want, but you clean and freeze them.
-----
FernandoRocker: I would like to try all the things you mentioned, but I don't know if I will be able to. I think I'll just have to find something to eat right away.
-----
Aurongel: I reheat them and throw them in a blender for about 5-10 min to let them cook at least a handful of times. If the leftovers turn out perfectly fine you can throw them in a blender and just let them cook in the fridge a couple more days for freeze-ring or freeze-ring-maker.
-----
Cat Pee: I normally bring them to work to prepare a lunch for my coworkers but I've noticed they come back up and overwritten the white sauce box in my refrigerator.
-----
Ultima_5: I save them in the fridge for the day of the upcoming holiday. I wouldnt worry about them cooking though. just store them in the fridge and use them as a replacement if you get sick or have a stressful job
-----
Wag: I like them cooked. I reheat them and throw them in a blender. If they turn out cooked well then I throw them in the freezer for a week.
-----
Atraveller: I reheat them and give them to a friend with an appetite. Next time I'm cooking dinner, I'll bring them to the microwave with a glass of plain zait.
-----
AmericanKirby: I may feel a bit sick at that point, but you'll be able to sort of handle it when you're feeling like it, or if you're just tired and don't have a desire to eat again.

~!~Trump to nominate a special counsel to handle the Mueller investigation (Senate Version)

ElectricBlanketFire: The original version of this story is below.
Senate Bill 200, which was filed in December, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and is expected to become law in February.
A version drafted without much input from Senate Democrats is below.
-----
Opto: Crap to see a version that includes a Senate vote.
-----
Elandyll: I'm not familiar with this bill and it's a tad toothless, but I can see how it could be interesting in the laws that are likely to be made public in the next few years.
-----
demosthenes: Just a heads up I don't live in the state I work, but I will say this.
-----
Punished Goku: I was worried that this would go a lot like the Anita Hill shit we saw in the past.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I don't know what you're expecting from this version of the thread.

It would go around with some of the most heavy-handed questions Trump could ask.

~!~Anime and tabletop RPG community (as described as not being called "Rpg 2" 

SOLDIER: It's always been something of a weird mishmash of experiences and interests that I've encountered over the years, from just randomly learning about visual novels to stumbling around on Giant Bomb and realizing I've never played any, and then having to explain to college students what the hell I was talking about in hopes of making them understand what I was talking about.
Being a huge anime nerd myself (I guess), I was always drawn to stuff that had a genre twist. RPGs aren't just video games, they're various forms of media like movies, television shows, comics, whatever. For RPG fans, that twist might be "a story with a world in it," "world-building within a boss fight" or "a story where everyone in a scenario is god, the game gives everyone abilities that make them able to do anything and do anything. The whole "instruments of the game would allow everyone to do anything, and they all have to interact with each other to do so."
But then, it's also been pointed out that RPGs aren't necessarily video games. There are plenty of popular games that are designed in such a way that you truly understand what the stories of a RPG are about. Until fairly recently, RPGs were the trinity of a tabletop RPG set in board game form, with the other two being just a bunch of RPGs. That's not really new. But I just saw that the trend of popular RPG characters being replaced by anime characters and video games just made it a bit more convenient to have them in my life than other, "superhero" characters.
But now, I'm seeing the whole "Rpg 2" thing starting to make the rounds, and it's making me worried that it may actually lead to something worse than bad experiences. Because while I understand the appeal of a bunch of being able to think up a story with a world in it, I don't want to be the person to lead a Kickstarter that plays the game out of their mind. I don't have time to think that I just need to read a whole 10 books in one go, so I'm not interested in those.
Am I wrong about that? Is there anything I should be concerned about when it comes to this? Am I missing something?

~!~Why do so many people have terrible accents?

Coyote Starrk: The way that I phrase this topic is just.... awful. 
The way I say "liked" it is just... not what I expected. And I am a moron. And I am also a dumbass. And I am just a complete luddite. 
Why even ask us to have terrible accents if you're asking for a very specific phrase to be so terrible.
-----
shnurgleton: Cause they're pretty bad for a country to start a war with
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Because it's a shitty accent.
-----
Cocolina: Because it's a lazy way of saying "faggot"
-----
PJV3: I lost it at a low quality Cantonese, so I am super awful at this.

Coyote Starrk: Yeah that's the only thing I was thinking when I said it. The way I say it is just... no.

hydrophilic attack: because it's a lazy way of saying "faggot"

~!~The former ambassador of Belarus has been removed from his post

Carn: It sucks for Belarusians. I mean... some might say he was a former ambassador. Did you know that the Belarusian people are currently under 4m people? And the president just kinda took control of 4.5% of the parliament? And the people who are under his umbrella are basically thugs, in this day and age how would that affect the 1.5x sphere of influence of the presidency?
-----
Airbar: This is not good.
-----
Stinkles: That's a good move from the Belarusian people. He should stay out of the Russian press, and not have any connection to anyone that might have a Russian connection. He should have done more to reach out to the Russian media instead of getting his hands tied into a paper he ran against.
-----
Xando: Didn't he resign in a rare move, but not surprising?
-----
RedBlue: Yeah that’s the first thing I’m thinking of when I think of it.
-----
Nassudan: Somewhere after this I'd think it would be easier to reach out to the Russian press than to leave him out of the limelight.
-----
nazgul_hunter: At least he doesn't have to keep fighting with the press anymore. At least then that won't be his problem.
-----
Kukulcan: The news about him was something I felt was difficult to ignore, so I gave the ambassador the benefit of the doubt.
-----
Carn: Yeah, that's why I trust the press more than anyone else. Russian state media, through their own propaganda, somehow manages to have more views and influence than any news organization.
-----
Carn: That's what I'm thinking too, I'm not really sure how much they can squeeze out of other people.

Coyote Starrk: Of course it says death trap because Trump doesn't really care about the GI Bill.

~!~How do you deal with a day of sleep paralysis?

Cybersai: I've had this for about four years now. I suddenly have trouble falling asleep, and the alarm sounds like it would wake me up if I don't sleep for an hour. I have severe difficulty moving my body and my arms are constantly shaking if I'm trying to move.
How do you deal with night night nights in general? I'm so afraid of falling asleep, and it's really making me paranoid. I can't sleep because I have not had enough sleep, and it takes a lot of nights of sleep paralysis to dull my ability to sleep. I need to sleep tonight, because the next day of sleep paralysis really sucks.
-----
Chivalry: Have you tried cressing away your eyes with an object?
-----
Drain You: I used to always sleep with the lights on and on until I was tired and could go to sleep. But I have no problem with it, I just don't feel like I need to be awake, and I've had enough sleep that the next day of sleep is actually enough to make me realize how tired I am. I have never had a problem with it and it's something that I've learned to deal with in the past couple of years. The little bit of sleep I'm lacking in is pretty precious.
-----
Novoitus: it's not a scary thing tho
-----
EvoTech: Sometimes I just sleep with my eyes closed but I wake up in the morning up to like 4-5 hours, so it's a torture. And I think I just have a falling asleep pattern.
-----
Lumination: This.
-----
Citizencope: I used to have this too. It was pretty bad and I woke up feeling horrible. I wish I could remember the last time I had that condition, I just remember being really tired and I forget everything...
-----
turbobrick: I sometimes sleep with my eyes closed but if I jumped in my bed I'd have to put my hand on my knees and try to sniff my sleeping pill.
-----
Verelios: A full night or so of REM sleep? I think it's a pretty common thing, but I avoid it all the time. 
I'm always surprised how often I get sleep paralysis, though. Usually I'm surprised it's not happening to me, but I end up having

~!~(writer/producer) "Growing Pains" - A little bit of ResetERA nostalgia going in

sabrina: (from the writer of the book - Christopher Tolkien)
I'm about halfway through "Growing Pains" by Stephen King. It's quite an engaging read, and one of the rare books I've purchased for my daughter. It's not out today, but I'm looking forward to giving it another read.
I also did a write in "The Goblin King" by G.K. Noble.
Here's the synopsis:
-----
haotshy: Read the whole thing and I'm interested in checking out more of it.

~!~Why isn't there more discussion about sexual violence against women?

fireflame: In recent times, many people have been harassed, mocked, accused of being gay, even killed for "undermining the way of the troops". While there is still a lot of stigma attached to sexual violence, this isn't the first time this has happened.
In the past few years, many media personalities have been attacked, shouted down, insulted, raped, and even executed for "undermining the will of the troops".
So, why is it so hard to discuss the issue? It is a complex issue, and no one is trying to paint it as a Jewish problem.
-----
Trojita: The Israeli government is a big motherfucker.
-----
FrequentFlyer: There was a time when the Israeli government actually gave a shit about you being a gay "Bibi". Now, we don't need to be told that a person might be a sexual predator.
-----
DiipuSurotu: The Trump administration had a huge impact when the Right Stuff Goes Kickstarter started
-----
Kyougar: Because they are not interested in talking about this.
-----
FrequentFlyer: Yes, the right thing to do is to make them talk about it. I'm really not that interested in the topic, but for Israel, a poster can be a good example of their resistance.
-----
fireflame: I am not interested in the subject but I have seen many posters coming off as racist, sexist and antisemitic.
-----
Ekevias: The problem is that the right is not interested in talking about the issue. They want to be the ones to know about the victims, and that makes them feel threatened.
-----
Pomerlaw: The media has a bias when it comes to sexual violence against women?
Oh, don't watch the US media, they are bastards.
-----
fireflame: I am not interested in Israel, I am interested in the victims and their plight. The Israeli government is a big motherfucker.

Hawk: I've been developing a DAT package for my computer since it's 17 years old and I don't have a digital address book or an online registry. I want to track all my packages and only put them in the right order, and I want to keep them numbered. Whats the best way to do this? I am looking for an online registry of sorts for this sort of thing. I understand tracking is important, but is there anyway to store it in the right order? Or am I just out of curiosity?
-----
Droidian: I used to, but now I don't know how to do it. I am just curious as to how to do it if you have a registry.
-----
hordak: just login to some of your packages and see whats up

Hordak: no, just use your phone number, the password will be kept strictly private, so don't ask questions about it.
-----
hordak: I know you do this, but I don't know how to do it, I am just curious as to how to do it.
-----
Droidian: Thanks for the advice. I use the same phone number I used to get in the late 2000's. I just want to keep it private.
-----
Hordak: I don't know how, but I just need to use the address book.
-----
Hordak: thanks, but I know you do this, and don't want questions about it.

Hordak: yes, I use a different phone number then than my address book, I don't need to add the password, I just use the address that generates the password, which I use for my online accounts.

~!~What are your favorite "Buffy" movies?

Jarrod38: When I first watched the first time through the Disney streaming service back in December of 2000 I was excited to see how the franchise was evolving. I didn't see the Disney Renaissance coming, and I was getting ready to start watching the show again quite a while back. 
Fast forward to the launch of the Disney Renaissance in 2005, and I've been rewatching the series since it's early stages and I just recently watched the first season of the Disney Fox Fox animated show. It's a series that started way before the Disney Renaissance was a thing. What are your favorite "Buffy" movies?
-----
sabrina: Disney Renaissance.
That's what I was watching.
-----
Seesaw15: The original Buffy and Buffy are amazing.
-----
DarthWoo: I thought they were going to be one of the first DCEU movies, but they didn't really seem to have decided on that yet.
Buffy is easily my favorite.
-----
Lunchbox-: Buffy
Fantastic Knight
-----
Whitemex: This is a good question
-----
Transistor: I mean I have a soft spot for the original but I haven't seen the new ones
-----
Puck Beaverton: Buffy
Amazing Knight
-----
DrForester: My initial list was...
- The Shadow Clone, but the first two seasons were pretty fun.
- The Clone Brood, but the series really took off.
- The Creeps, but I think the best part of the series was getting to experience the Disney Renaissance as a whole.
- The Woo, but I kinda just wanted it to last longer.
-----
ClamBuster: the original must-watch, i mean it's a nice binge watch, and it's good, but i think you'll be fine skipping the good stuff - the only good Disney originals after the Disney Renaissance are all about the same

I just do it when I’m going through a story, and then when I’m going through a movie, or a concert, or a song. I just don’t know how good they can hear me. I guess I could carry around a little fwiw and say some specific audio throughout my whole life, but it’s just not worth the energy of any other activity.
What do you think about audiophiles?

~!~The report: "Losing your job for something" by writer/artist/artist/groupthink

B-Dubs: Never heard of this and just started a new thread, but I feel like this is a very important, important piece of evidence that we have a problem with our art. It literally says: "It's not okay to be ripped apart for your entire career.
Artists who complain about the loss of art, or even complain about losing their jobs for something, are also abusers. And we've seen some cases of people being fired for 'appropriation' of the works they design, which they can blame on the art (in these cases, of course, they'll never admit to the practices themselves). 
I feel like we're in a time where some really bad people are saying that ruining art is a problem, but we probably need to do better ourselves.
-----
FlowersisBritish: Yeah I'm just gonna say I've had my share of shitty articles trash about the art world and I'm glad if it's getting better I can still get paid for my work.

Dio Over Heaven: I was waiting for something great to start coming out. I've seen a lot of terrible cringe about art from people who don't give a shit.

Nikus: Been on a youtube journey lately and I'd like to find what's best for those just starting out and how to deal with stuff like ads and subscriptions.
I used to use YT a lot to watch them, but I've been stuck with having to manually delete videos for so long because the uploader can't figure out how to handle deleting them.
I had a great idea to a certain extent but it's expensive and time consuming. I'm looking for alternatives and I'd like to be able to use YouTube for free before they are posted.

jwk94: I've only looked at the app for Plex and I'm confused on what's the best way to use it. I understand that Plex has a handy feature where you can specify which episodes of the show are available in a playlist, but what's the best way to use it? I think I want to watch something with my girlfriend and I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with it. I'm gonna try to find something that works for my purposes, but I'm not too sure where to start. (also, I'm not 100% sure about the app itself, so I don't know if this is an intended feature or not)
-----
linkboy: I think Plex supports DVR shows or something like that.
-----
SieteBlanco: The app is live. Use it for a few weeks straight without interruption.
-----
SieteBlanco: That's true.
-----
linkboy: Yeah, it's live. But for a few weeks straight without interruption it gives you the option to just download episodes. But for a family of 4 the option is better.
-----
SieteBlanco: Maybe if you don't have the subscriptions service yet, but this is what I've used so far.
-----
SatoAilDarko: I've been using it for about 2 years now, it recently got updated to fix a bug where it would only show new episodes of the show that it was currently airing.

I can't imagine how many people this will affect.

Razgriz-Specter: Having taken days off in the past, I've come around on one day of free time and never worked out, but when I do I do take a break and then I have another couple of days to work on something else.

Fat4all: i dont remember them being best friends or anything

Drain You: My mom is 23 and she's been married for almost 20 years now.
She's also 35 now so she's probably still in her 20's.
The only thing i remember them for is talking about how they'd fuck if they could and in the rare case that they thought it was the norm, they were still in their early 20's.

====================
~!~Please, forgive me, but I think I've seen this scene

Uzumaki Goku: This was on the movie "The Town". 
I've never seen this scene, and I've just seen it open and read it.
The movie is about a couple of kids and their dad, who is watching TV, and the couple is playing a TV show, and apparently in the town their dad is watching a show and he has the dad have the kids' dad look at the TV show. 
What the fuck?
-----
CormoranStrike: It's nothing but b-roll. It's just a few frames of the kid being led away in handcuffs.
-----
Sephzilla: I thought cops were always looking for the real deal
-----
jkm23: I've seen this, with the exact same person, and the last shot is a phone light on TV with a black background.
I've never seen him break, I've seen him break with a piece of his pants, and I've seen him break with his pants untied.
-----
Rackham: It's a cop thing. You can't do shit like this without the other type of thing.
-----
Doomguy Fieri: Apparently, the cop is trying to break up a fight between two teens.
-----
Charpunk: It’s like the most bizarre scene in the entire movie.

Nerdkiller: I want to suggest that this was the most booooooormed scene ever filmed.

Thewonandonly: So I was listening to this song on shuffle and I was wondering what it’s about. I know I’ve listened to some of the most popular songs on shuffle here and I thought it would do just fine.
So I was wondering if anyone has any recs for the song and which is your favorite.
Also I’m not really a big fan of “I’ll wake up next Tuesday” or “I’ll wake up next Tuesday”

~!~What is the point of a wedding chapel?

MrRob: I'll be in your face for a wedding ceremony tomorrow and I'm not sure I want to go. I think this is a stupid idea and I don't want a bunch of guests coming to my wedding. 
I've always had a strong desire to go to a wedding ceremony but I never thought I'd be so emotionally involved with the wedding itself. 
So all that being said, is there something I could do to make my wedding go better? I'm going to be travelling and I'll be traveling for a week it seems. 
Should I go, or what do I do?

Hiphopopotamus: His face has blood all down his chin

~!~How do you deal with a Friends problem?

SageShinigami: I don't know what the hell is going on in the Friends community, but I feel like I'm physically hurting because I'm reaching out to someone. I'm reaching out to someone, but I feel like I'm reaching them. I'm reaching them because I feel like I'm hurting because I'm reaching them. If I was on my own, I would be concerned about it, but I'm here, I feel like I'm going to hurt others.
I wouldn't mind an Era we can have constructive dialogue about it, but I don't know how to deal with it. The social dynamics are the same as mine. I don't know what it is, but there's no reason I can't smile or laugh, I feel like I'm going to hurt others.
I don't know what the deal is anymore, I don't know if I'm hurting my own feelings or what the point of this is. I just feel like I'm hurting my own feelings. I don't know what to do anymore. I just feel like I can't do anything about this. I just feel like I can't do anything about this. I mean, I guess I can feel like I'm hurting my own feelings, but I just feel like I can't do anything about this. Like, I can't even do anything about it.
Am I going to die?

truant: You're not dying, it's just bro.

SageShinigami: I dunno man, I feel like I'm just going to hurt more people. It's not like I'm alone and I can feel the pain of others, I just feel like I can't do anything.

Viking Jesus: If I'm having a problem with your feelings, it's definitely rude to let it bother you.
-----
Neece: I feel you.

BocoDragon: I feel like I’m going to hurt others, but I don’t go to people all the time. I’ve just been hurt before, and I feel like that’s it.
I try to avoid confrontation, but I’m not immune to being hurt.

SageShinigami: You're not a fucking friend.

~!~Do you still use a laptop/phone/tablet running iOS 12?

TheFallenSaboteur: I take my iPhone X and I'm pretty much in the same position as I am now, but I'm always tempted to think I'm better off getting a new iPhone 7 or a new iPad. I'm sure I'll be fine, but I'm curious about the current state of iOS 12.

Cocolina: I'm still doing my own thing and using the latest version.
-----
BronsonLee: Nope, I still have a 6

Tizoc: I'm still on iOS 12.
I'm using a 7.

Luminaire: I decided iOS wasn't for me to begin with. I just didn't care enough to change anything.
-----
Duxxy3: iOS 12 is still really good for my needs, I guess.
-----
ryseing: iOS 12 is slower and more clunky than I'd like to believe. I'm still using essential software on iOS 11 though.
-----
NoMoreTrolls: iOS 12 is really solid for me. I haven't updated my iPhone since the iPhone 5S.
-----
BLEEN: iOS is too "cheap" for me for my needs, I'm just too out of my comfort zone to worry about that stuff. I'll consider myself pretty well beyond my comfort zone limit if I can get a good deal on a good phone.

Sunster: Jason.
Also, as for guy, who is your favorite?

sphagnum: Alan.

~!~What's the most expensive "addon" you've ever spent on a TV?

Dali: I hear ya'll but what's the most expensive "addon" you've ever spent on a TV? I know there are some TV models like Vivo, Sony, Vizio, etc. that are worth it for a TV, but I'm not sure where others go from here.
I'm getting a lot of Inquirer subscriptions for a TV that I need for bed. I have a bedroom TV and a small bedroom TV, so I'll be spending probably a lot more for the TV. Anywhere you can get the price tags on those things?
-----
xxracerxx: There is nothing wrong with a budget TV.
-----
Dali: I actually don't know much about the price of things, but I just want a place to chill.
-----
Dishwalla: I spent two weeks in Vegas last summer on a $500+ TV. I didn't even think it was that expensive. Only $300 for the TV.
-----
MrNewVegas: Your budget GOAT.
-----
Hokahey: I have a nice 5k screen and a cheap 5k screen and a 4k screen. I'm not so sure about this one.
-----
KrigareN-: I don't know what is the most expensive you've ever spent on a model. Maybe you can look for similar options?
-----
DrewFu: I went through the most expensive TV I ever had was a 55" 1080p set, and the most expensive TV I ever bought was a 4k TV I had in 2015. I didn't even know how expensive it was.
-----
DrewFu: That's a good point. I just spent almost $800 on the Streaming Stick and it was the most expensive TV I ever had. I guess the TV was a bit over $700?
-----
DrewFu: That's the entire reason I was checking reviews. I was just going to spend more for the TV.

~!~Michael Cohen's wording of the bill that would make it illegal to donate money to foreign governments will be voted into the House

RPGamer92: 
(CNN)One of the biggest lobbyists for the Trump campaign and their Russian allies, Michael Cohen, has written the final version of the bill that would make it illegal to donate money to foreign governments unless they have specific restrictions on their fundraising or donations. 
The final version of the bill, which is still being written, was voted in the House Thursday and its fate to be signed into law by Trump's Republican Senator, Mike Rounds, the same day as his scheduled press conference. 
The wording of the bill that has Cohen writing its version is also what prompted this tweet:

I'm not quite sure why the show takes so long to get around to filming 4 and 5, but I'll be checking it out.
-----
ZeoVGM: This will be good.
-----
rude: Just a Marvel show looking to get its shit together.
-----
ManaByte: Not a spin off, but I'd assume it's trying to get people back into the universe. It's being hosted by Star Wars fans.

~!~Why isn't the GOP party more united?

flkRaven: Seriously, this is depressing. Why is the GOP less united? Why are they so fractured and fractured at the same time?
I'm not saying that the Democrats aren't broken but I'm just asking the question: Why isn't the GOP the political party more united than the Democrats? Why is it that the GOP party has less united folks? Why are there so many people who are more united than the Democrats?
-----
BWoog: Because you're not being racist to a white working class. You're being racist to a subset of the country that is racist. 
The GOP is the political party that is less divided.
-----
Wafflinson: Because the democrats don't have the majority in the house.
The GOP is the one that is more divided.
-----
Empyrean Cocytus: The Republican Party is the party that is more united. The Democrats are the one that is less divided.
The only statistic unique to the GOP is votes from the white working class.
-----
hydrophilic attack: because white working class voters voted for Trump.
because of their alliance with the republican party.
-----
SlickShoesRUCRazy: Because the dems are the party that is more united.
-----
hydrophilic attack: the dems are always right most times
basically, the republican party is the party that is divided.
the left is the party that is divided.
-----
Pwnz: The difference in the two parties isn't huge, but it's not the difference in political positions that matters. The point is that there's a difference in policies, policies that matter. If the left puts in the same stuff or the same people together, it's almost always within the party itself.

Ether_Snake: The difference in policy is less than 0.1%

~!~Vin Diesel wants Shane Black and Kate Mara to direct a movie, Marvel is the obvious choice

ZeoVGM: I don't know why you would want a Val Russo to direct a film, but you'd have to be pretty crazy to think that this is the right call. I've always liked the idea of this film. It's not just a Shane Black film or a Wonder Woman film. It's not just a Wonder Woman film, but The Negotiator. I'd be shocked if the director wanted to direct this. It's the perfect balance between direct and live action. I think it's a perfect choice.

ElectricBlanketFire: You might want to ask in the comments what happened to that other one you mentioned?

Mindwipe: That's not a new movie you've seen, but you probably didn't think to google it, so it may not be the movie you're looking for.

Just a random video game.

Mr.Awesome: Came into this thread to make a post about this.
I watched it a few days ago and thought it was awesome. I don't remember all the major plot points, but it was fairly unique and a little more cheesy than it normally would be out of the 90s.

~!~I don't think I've ever had a "great" idea

Dynamite Cop: I don't think I've ever had a "great" idea.
For me, it's the idea that I'm not a person and shouldn't feel pity. That I'm just a man and that I shouldn't feel guilty.
I think I've had a few ideas, but nothing that really occurred to me. I just don't know what to think, what my options are, what the fuck is going on, etc. etc.
I suppose it could be that I'm just a bored and unhappy person who doesn't know what's going on, or maybe I just don't like the idea of it, but I don't know how to think about it or how I could change it.
I'm just curious how have any of you had a "great" ideas?
-----
Truly Gargantuan: I'm not sure I'd ever have a great idea if I didn't have spent enough time thinking about it.
-----
John Dunbar: i can only think of the bad things that i've thought of
-----
HellforLeather: I don't think my idea was that bad, it was just that nobody else was ever making it.
-----
Aeana: I'm a fairly accomplished person, so very few things took me by surprise.
But I think that the majority of people trying to make this kind of stuff into a form of mass entertainment don't really realize it's possible.
-----
The Albatross: At least, I think I've had a few good ideas. A lot of them were so bold that they had to be pretty radical to actually work.
I've had some ideas that are just as good, but I think I had a much harder time convincing people to actually go out and try them than I had doing it.
But most of the time I've also had great ideas I didn't work on, but very few people actually tried to make them work.
-----
StrawberryJam: I've thought about that too but I never had the balls to try it.

zychi: Yeah I have had a few ideas that have worked but never really happened.
I'm not sure if those ever worked out in the end and if it actually made any difference in the end.

Rivenblade: This is a thread to discuss which movie you voted for and why.
There are three main sections to talk about:
Trailers/personal reviews:
The full list can be found here: 
Your average Rotten Tomatoes score is not very complete, but it is far enough in the upper right that it deserves to be here.
Your average Twitter/Facebook score is not very complete, but it is far enough in the upper right that it deserves to be here.
Your average YouTube/streaming score is not very complete, but it is far enough in the upper right that it deserves to be here.
Your average comments score is not very complete, but it is far enough in the upper right that it deserves to be here.
Your average reviews are not very complete, but it is far enough in the upper right that it deserves to be here.
Your average rating depends on the thread you're in, so if I wrote a more popular thread, then I'll add it to the top 10.
Note that in case of a "Your Average Rating" link, the average rating will be in the "Comments " tab.

Zelenogorsk: Average rating and average score for the first two videos were my top movies of the year. I don’t know why I even left the thread.
-----
Rivenblade: I think you nailed it. I just added the YouTube/streaming score to the OP:
-----
Zelenogorsk: All three videos are user reviews. I write these for the movies I adore, and my average rating is a few points higher than a normal review. I also consider the user reviews to be more reliable than the average YouTube video. So I don't care if the average rating was a bit over-the-top.

combine42: I added this to my RT score as well

~!~LTTP: The Last Kingdom

Jam_Sandwich: Just finished watching The Last Kingdom and I'm frankly shocked how good it is. I'd seen it years ago and it's still fresh in my mind.
I like the concept of the Kingdom and how it exploited a military coup to regain the throne.
I'm not a huge book reader but I completely understand that a war between the nations of the other involved a lot of text and could probably fill a book.
I'm not excited to watch a movie about the final days of WW1 again but I'm sure the military leadership is interesting.
Also the ending was great and the ending was kind of meta.
Rewatching the series for the first time this weekend and I was reminded how good it is.
All the characters were well written and the ending was a very satisfying twist.
The soundtrack was also great and if you're a fan of Sci-Fi, The Last Kingdom is a movie that would never have happened if it weren't for the soundtrack.
The characters were incredibly nuanced and interesting and the ending was what truly broke me up.
The characters were just there for the ending and really made you appreciate what is happening.
I highly recommend the film just to reset the mood if you haven't and have absolutely nothing to say.
Anyone else have to read book’s?

Mona: The third book is the best one, and the second one is good. It's basically just a series of bad events that don't really get resolved, but are very entertaining.
I think you'll enjoy it after you finish Kingdom.
-----
Zoc: I read the third book a couple of years ago and just finished it. It was pretty bad, but it did get done. I enjoyed the ending, but I'm not the biggest book reader but I'd say it's still pretty bad.
-----
Blader: I read the third book when it came out and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The second book is a different kind of book and doesn't really get resolved, but it's quite good.

Sweeney Swift: I read the first book a while back and ended up really enjoying it and the third one is quite good too, I really liked the ending.

~!~New to the market: Is there a local food or bakery?

TaterTots: I've been spared a few bad days this week, but a couple new local food or bakery threads here and there. I'm thinking of making some turkey burgers tonight. I'm going to use this as a base to plan out a few foods, and I'm open to homemade or open-source recipes.
What are your thoughts, Era?
-----
Airegin: A local bakery?
-----
Cybersai: I don't cook unless I have to and I know the quality is drastically different than the baker's. 
If I were to ask, I'd probably just buy a whole loaf of bread and toast and just eat those as lunch.
-----
TaterTots: I'm not trying to be a dick but I do believe in making foods for everyone.
-----
TaterTots: Oh man, I want to make some ketchup, too.
-----
lobdale: I used to make local bread and it was a good experience if you want to make it yourself.
-----
mjc: Wait, what?
-----
TaterTots: I'll be making turkey burgers for Thanksgiving I have some butter in my turkey burgers. I'll get some butter for the rest of the week. I don't know what I'm going to do then.
-----
CrazyAndy: I make all my sandwiches from work.

Hollywood Duo: Apple.

~!~I think I'm over-analgemying my hair

jwk94: All I can think of to explain is that I bled my hair last night. I had it done in the shower and I felt really freaked. 
So, ERA, what's the best way to manage your hair? Any tips?
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Go with a generic wax. I think one of the best things to do is figure out how much water you used to put it in and dry it out a little. You'll be doing better and your hair will feel way better.
-----
Beartruck: Dry your hair down?
-----
baggage: If you're like me and it's super-dry, you need to be shampooing it every other day, or at least every other day, for 6 weeks before going to the barber.
-----
Poppy: my hair is pretty thick and I used to use a little bit of shampoo a day but i only use it in the shower and usually just use on my dreads now and again. to be honest i really like the shampoo now. it doesnt hurt if your hair is a little thinning but it takes a long time to get used to it
-----
jwk94: What do you mean longer than 6 weeks? I know some places recommend 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks is fine.
-----
FUME5: My hair is actually pretty damn beastly.
-----
sgtnosboss: anyone with a shaved head? I've heard that it can be really effective.
-----
jwk94: I'm not really a hater, I'm just curious if it's worth it.

Piecake:

Khanimus: I would be shocked if he had a lawyer.
-----
NineConsonants: Unless the wife was a real estate broker I wouldn’t be surprised in the least.
-----
PersonAndStuff: Yeah, the guy must have a lawyer.
-----
Lumination: Not a lawyer.
-----
Brock Reiher: Man just gotta get out. As long as it doesn't end up in a bank account.
-----
Ploid 6.0: So this is going to get a lot of legal trouble when the wife is not a broker. That's not a guarantee of anything.
-----
Dekuman: That's actually not an indictment.
-----
Jceaz: Too many lawyers?
-----
Ploid 6.0: I'm not sure, but I think the wife is obligated to pay off all her debts in full when the bus ticket expires. If the bus ticket fails, she can claim a partial payment of the debts at the end of the month, and thus she is entitled to call the bank on it.

~!~How do you deal with an estranged father?

SageShinigami: So I'm in a weird situation since I'm not really related to my dad. I live with my stepdad, who's been gone for over a year now. I've never had any type of interaction with him, though I've had a few niggas with him. The closest interaction that I've had with him was for the past year, where we were friends. I've had a few niggas since then, and every couple months or so we try and try and reach an agreement about what we'll be doing in the future. There's basically no reason for my dad to stay in the house, or be gone for a while.
I try to keep a low profile and be friendly to my stepdad, even though it's obviously not going to affect my future decisions. I don't want to get in the middle of a lot of drama, since I'm a minority that would be a bit annoying to have at a family gathering with my dad and aunt. I'm not sure if this is a doomsday-style situation that will get me banned or if my dad is going to get an estranged himself. I'm just curious if anyone else here deals with this or if it's just me.
-----
Bio: I'm trying to be friendly to my dad and aunt and don't want to look like a nutjob in the middle of it. I'm trying to keep my face neutral
-----
Wanderer5: In my own head, my situation has always been that he's a "humorous" guy who never really talked to me about anything and I don't really like him. I don't think I will ever get him banned, but I am trying to be nice and try to be friendly towards him. I do think he's a nutjob though, and I do think his antics are bad but I don't really know how else to explain it.
-----
Robinson: I've never had a father
-----
BDS: In my head, it's always that he's a dumbass that'll get away with it.
-----
Heromanz: I'm not a dad

-----
Sibersk Esto: I'm aware that you have the option to watch FLCL and FLIE, I didn't know the options existed.

Kasai: I'm not sure if it's the best option, but I'm in the US. 
As far as you guys know, you can watch FLCL and FLIE on the same device, but it's not a must.

-----
Vanillalite: This isn't a thread about some generic recommendation (which is good). I'm just looking for a great option to be in the US.

====================
~!~Analysing the lives of the old at risk of fascism.

SG-17: Just a few days ago there was a BBC piece on a hypothetical Thatcher-May scenario for the UK. The author goes into detail about how each government would react to a Thatcher-May scenario and how each country would have to carefully protect its right to vote for a right wing government.
Anyway, looking at the data I am struck by the logical conclusion that they would have to protect their right to vote for a right wing government.
The main problem is that the institutions do not exactly line up logically anymore.
For example, the British House of Parliament has already voted for the government, and is preparing to vote. Nevertheless, the opposition has demonstrated that it will be willing to pay huge sums of money to silence the opposition. The government in question has a vested interest in ensuring that the public and opposition don't let the same problem happen again.
This argument is based on a faulty assumption that the political will of the people is what allows the government to be formed. That is, if the people simply do not want another Blair-May Brexit, then Labour will be able to form government.
This article argues that no one is going to be in the position of voting for the opposition party, that the opposition is merely an instrument in their control, that they will not be able to form a government, because no government will ever create their own laws. This article also argues that the way in which the current situation explained the deaths of Robert Denbins, Dimitar Oduht and Dottir Nemestilis, all of which are caused by the people themselves.
I am not a noradian.
-----
CormoranStrike: I don't think that is true, I think the opposite. The people are not going to vote for them, nor the left, as they can't form their own law.
-----
brokeastronaut: It's not just a right wing government. Right wing parties in both Europe and the US have tried to make their numbers look better but I'm not sure how they'll do it.
-----
SG-17: I also think that the reason for the recent death of a man is that the German people just realized that the left wasn't going to be around to kick the Nazi's out of office. So a left wing party in Germany would move in and take their place.

~!~Warhammer 40K coming to North America?

RatskyWatsky: I'm going to be in the UK in a couple months (from today) so I'm very curious what countries the warhammer 40k series will be filmed in. I'm especially interested in:
- the filming of the films in Spain
- the UK as a filming medium and the UK as a film rights holder.
- the UK as a film distribution and distribution partner
What do you think, will the series be filmed in North America? I'm also interested in:
- the UK as a filming rights partner for a series that will probably involve the films in Spain
- filming the films in Scotland
- the UK as a filming partner for the film in Scotland
I'd like to be able to watch the films on their home media server in the UK but I've heard some good things about the likelihood of that happening. The UK as a filming partner for the Lord of War is a given, but I'm not sure that a series of films in the North would have the same cultural and political pull as the movies in theatres. Is the only reason why there's no North American show?
-----
RatskyWatsky: South America is a film series.
-----
RatskyWatsky: Hmm. I'd like to see what the UK will be, but I don't know much about Spain.

FernandoRocker: I've never seen such a thing before.
I flew over the area and a friend and I were heading out to a golf course. They're brown like green. There is a size of a dildo in the water above me, and there is a drain under it.
We had to run to a nearby gas station and the owner of the car had the gas leak in his home. A hose is connected to the door using a pouches inside.
So we were heading out and it's like, the fuck?
I'm like, what the fuck?

~!~Introducing Spotify Premium for 30 day free trial

Haziqonfire: As you may know I've been considering switching from my iPhone all the time, but now I just needed something to add some music to my Spotify, so this is perfect for me:
30 day free trial for the iPhone.
Music Playlist:
Albums:
Music Playlist:
“Wipe the data on your data iTunes!” - Spotify Premium, the premium music service of Spotify.
“ "Uninstall Apple Music! - uninstall it! It's as good as Soundcloud!" - Spotify Premium, the service where I use Spotify for music.
Where to order packs of music:
I'm not going to get any of the albums directly, but I'll put on a playlist where they're available.
If I decide to "upgrade" one item from my library, the band selection will be the same, and the album art will cover the album art.
I'll add some extra music to my music library, but won't add them all to my Spotify.
Thanks so much for the help and suggestions everyone.
-----
Napoleonthechimp: My only experience with Spotify Premium was the first album I purchased I heard on Spotify and then just never downloading the rest. I don't know if it's a problem with Spotify Premium or not, but I found that the Spotify app on my iPad would always download the same song regardless of whether I played a certain song.

~!~So, I just saw this on YouTube and now I'm with a conscience

The Real Jeremy: I'm a bit of an outsider but from what I've seen people tend to leave comments on the videos and I came across this on an Era channel called The Real Jeremy
I think it's an interesting video but I can't decide if it's worth sharing or not. Feel free to lock if you don't like the video or not. It's just so odd to me to see so many comments in one video.

hateradio: Are you trying to say that I would be a hypocrite to not like the video?

The Real Jeremy: I think it's good. I don't like that video.
-----
The Real Jeremy: I think it's good. I don't like that video.

Punished Goku: This is the first time I’m talking to the right here and I’m being very paranoid. I just got a security issue and a security issue. It’s me and I’m goood and I’m lonely. I’m on my phone pretty much every day and I’d like to hear what is going on. 
But I’m from Russia and I’ve been talking to this security guy for a month. He says that the Russian government is trying to hack the DNC and emails. He says they’ve got to come clean and have the email servers of the DNC hacked. And then proceeds to talk about how they have to use password managers to help them with this. I’m in such a hurry to pass that I’m not even being serious.
-----
hurlex: I'm cool with it. More people should feel safe around each other.
-----
ILikeFeet: I'm sure this guy has an excuse. he's a Russian citizen. he hasn't been hacked and is just a victim of US state actors. he's just a Russian. fuck him.

~!~Shower all day with a gallon of milk and oatmeal

TheBeardedOne: I just bought a gallon of water and oatmeal for my wife, and I'm showering and eating shower thoughts.
I know it's a tradition at work to do this, but I wanted to see if anyone here had any ideas on how to make it that would be more effective. I don't drink as much as I should, and I'm not particularly interested in the subject, so I'm just wondering how many people here have made this the default state of having a bucket of watered down oatmeal and oatmeal-based beverages over the past couple of weeks.
-----
Dishwalla: I once came home with a bucket of oatmeal and told coworkers I was showering and eating shower thoughts. They were happy.
-----
Dead Prince: I did this once. It was pretty good and I wish it was a standard oatmeal only.

~!~I can’t tell if my dog is aggressive or not

NineConsonants: I have a pitbull. She’s 3 years old, lives here and is very affectionate. She’s super soft and will absolutely chase you if you let her. She’s super moody sometimes, and will get really angry if you let her. She’s a rescue, but she has to be in the house for a while. She’s been on my back a lot today and she’s been really annoying to me. She’s also very social and is very quiet most days. She’s always around when I’m at work, so I’m worried about her just being alone. Any advice? 
Here’s the pitbull link. She’s on uschat. She’s been living here for a year. 
She’s super sweet and loving. We just had an intervention last week that we will put her in a cage. She is in great health condition and is a rescue.
-----
xxracerxx: Call me if you so chose, but it’s a pit bull.

-----
Teh Hamburglar: Oh, sorry, I’ll pass on that.
-----
sphagnum: Call her.
-----
EightBitNate: Call her.
-----
Mugsy: Keep in mind that this is a really small breed. Pitbulls are actually quite difficult to breed, they will get confused, aggressive dogs will fight for a bit or bite you.
-----
Alastor3: I have a pitbull so I can't say if this is it, but you'll want to get a professional dog translator to tell you that she's really friendly.
-----
NineConsonants: She is a rescue, so she has to be on the home side of the family. She’s a rescue and I have my own dog so I’m not going to shit.

Tagyhag: Is this a thread about dog aggression?

~!~Why is it a threat when a white person says that?

TheFallenSaboteur: This is something that has been bothering me the most recently. I've heard people say that "white people" are threats to white people and that it's not a white person's responsibility to kill black people. I've never really been aware of this until today.
I'm not trying to make a political point that's lame or to offend anyone specifically, but it's always been an issue with me.
What do you think?
-----
dietpepsi: I don't care if you're black. Do you?
-----
Puck Beaverton: Because you are.
-----
Linkark07: Because I'm not white.

bwahhhhh: that's not really a threat.

Lord of Ostia: Because we're all fucking idiots.

I'd say it's a threat to White Supremacy, think what they're saying.

~!~Anyone use the Wahl toolbox?

Krejlooc: I'm not sure if this is a good or bad idea, but I just got a Wahl 10.1 audio microphone and I need to connect it to my PC. I installed the Wahl Pro 11 speakers, but I'm not 100% sure if I should stick with the Wahl brand speakers or go with the Pioneer brand speakers. I have a Wahl P30x, but I have no idea if the P30x is even good.
I'm using an app called Wahl Ecologic, but it's supposed to let you connect to wireless speakers or other devices using Wahl's microphone features. Since I have no idea if the Ecologic works or not, I was hoping for some kind of external device that can let me connect to a Wahl camera. I'm not sure if the Wahl Pro 11s supports that, so I'm not sure if it does.
Just wanted to get some feedback here. I'm getting a bit worried because I'm hoping the Pro 11s don't have the Wahl protection, but the Ecologic does, so I would think the Pro 11s would do just as well if not better than the Pro 11s.
I'm also wondering if the Wahl P30s are any good.
-----
Krejlooc: They're not, because I'm getting a Wahl P30.

~!~Do People Actually Consider How Good a Burger Is?

Andrew Korenchkin: Because it's a big deal to people, I mean consider how good a burger is. A pound of cheese is like approx. 4.5 grams of sugar. A burger is like approx. 8 grams of meat. A quarter pound of cheese is like 12 grams of sugar. Et cetera.
-----
TronLight: People are thirsty for burgers. 
People are thirsty for cheese.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I've never heard anyone call a burger "cheap".
-----
Kewlmyc: I mean, it's a lot more than cheap. Cheap cheesesteaks are literally free.
-----
subpar spatula: A quarter pound of cheese is roughly half a pound of meat.
-----
Saganator: Just to be clear, "cheap" is relative. You probably have more in common with "free" the meat.
-----
TronLight: I'm fascinated by this.
-----
FUME5: I use a burger bun that's been on a burger for a while because it's so convenient to dip a spoon in cheese and it's probably more cheaper than a quarter pound of beef.
-----
Slayven: They are cheap, but the taste is not as important
-----
HStallion: A quarter pound of meat is about 22g of cheese.

~!~Hans Landa 'Is this real?' and 'Is this fake?'

signal: Guardian: 'Is this real?' actor accused of abuse, lies, blackmail
Daniels had been using a fictional character in his advertising agency's ad campaigns for many years, and he had been using it in his films for years, until one day he was filming himself in his bedroom.
But the actor's lawyer, Samir Ali, denied that he ever took the character in his earlier days - and insisted that he was just mimicking, writing in his head, "is this real?" "Real is this?" 
Daniels had been filming himself in his bedroom, but a colleague saw him in the early hours of Sunday, and on Tuesday morning, as he was filming himself, he said he took the character in as well.
After criticism from his colleagues, Ali's lawyer, Samir Ali, said he should be allowed to have a private discussion with his colleagues about the issue - and that he was allowed to use his private phone in the days before filming himself.

~!~Anyone else afraid of the dark?

Yasuke: Took my friend a few days of sleep loss to start to dread the dark. He went into a dream and I woke him up, and both of us were sweating and just talking.
It was pretty scary. I had a few moments of really good sleep, and the dream itself was very scary. I’ve never experienced anything like it before and it was scary as hell.
I finally called my friend and he agreed to go and check it over with him and he said he’d be fine, but that was only half an hour ago.
I’m really scared now!
How do you deal with the fear?

But then I realized I was not. I'd been awake for 6 hours at least and I'd gotten some hallucinations.
Anyway, I've had a few nightmares this morning, but the last one was during the day, so I don't really know what happened.

Yasuke: Had a nightmare the other night, lol.
The dream was...fair and balanced. It was just a tiny little bump, but inside it was a very distrubent, odd feeling as if I didn’t really feel anything.
I’m hoping it’s just a dream, a little nervous, or more that one small bump could be a real dream.
Anyway, I’m in the mood to try to get the fuck out of the house tonight, so I’d love to, but it’s been a

The other two species are pretty broadly known, but I found the Tongreen (T. elegans) and Macaque (C. elegs) both best for perfectly looking and looking great.

~!~How do you deal with insomnia?

Tethered Penguin: I am at a stage where I have to take at least 3 hours to sleep. I have not been able to fall into a depression since graduating high school.
I understand that I have to fall into a snooze-and-snooze, but I feel like I have a heightened awareness of things that are happening in my life and just trying not to dwell on them.
I've been on anti-anxiety creams for the last month though. I'm not sure if I am just getting drowsy or if I'm just taking a step back.

RiOrius: My whole life, I spent a lot of money on my house before I got married. I spent every day gathering all the necessary items for a house inspection, then going out to dinner, buying her some food and then watching TV on Netflix while I waited for the house to open. On top of that, I had time to sit in my car driving around and collect my money, sleep, and eat.
Then, on the morning of the wedding, I decided I had too much money in a savings account to spend. I had $200 saved up to buy a $300 PVC pipe for the day, which I then put in the toilet. I still had a long day to go until I finally got my house back up after some back and forth combing through a couple of sheets, my cats, and some cardboard.
So, I decided to wait a few weeks for my house to be opened up and start working on it, then just started the whole process of taking a house inspection and inspection and re-take the stuff I had in my car and putting it on the back porch and fixing it myself.

~!~So I've been working out and there's a new fitness app on my phone I can't get on.

Nothing Loud: I've never used Fitbit, but I've heard good things about their trackball. I've been looking for the app that lets me walk 6 miles in a 30 second section while doing a 5 second section during which I have a heart rate sensor and a heart rate monitoring device. I've seen that one on the app and it seems like it's pretty good. Anyone have experience with this app? Any tips?
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I use Tic tac. It’s good.
-----
shira: What is heart rate?
-----
Alucrid: just get a heart rate sensor
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I’m curious as to what it does.
-----
Alucrid: dont forget it does 1 second count and 10 second count.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I'll be honest and say that I haven't used the Tic tac trackball in months. I've used it frequently throughout my high school years.
-----
Drain You: I use the Peloton app on my Fitbit. I've recommended it to people before I've started running.
I'm not sure what it does. It's not for running, but for anyone who wants to learn how to run then give this a try.
-----
Jindrax: With Peloton you can start doing:
The main thing it does is lets you set your pace, workout and pace to get your body working faster.
-----
Rendering...: I've used Fitbit for years and have been very happy with it. I'm still rocking a Fitbit version of the Fitbit app.
I thought I'd give this a go in the ERA Fitness Community thread but nope, nobody has any use for Fitbit.

~!~What's the best time you've spent sitting in a dark theater?

KrigareN-: I'm sitting in an empty theater seat for the 1st time in my life. I just got a warm up from my snack box.
I'm in my seat. And I have to take a piss. And it's not like it was a big deal to me. It's a simple mistake. 
I don't do this because I'm uncomfortable, but it's inarguable that it's one of the WORST times to sit in a dark theater. 
Why? 
Because it's a cheap mistake. You're getting high fives from the audience, but you're not getting an actual massage. And it's a waste of your time.

I don't know if I have any more memories of this violence. I don't know what to do after this. I'm so scared to think what I did after this. I am so scared I don't know what to do.

It's crazy. And this is gaming related. If I go to a thread I started yesterday and there's a new thread in less than a month, there would've been about 20 new threads in less than a week.

~!~A poll shows that single-payer healthcare plan is a pipe dream

ZOONAMI: I mean, as a physician, not having a doctor visit with a family member that you don't have to make up a death, or a wound, or even a birth, is pretty much the only way to go about it.
But what about single-payer for your own health care needs? Here's the link to the original thread on ERA: 
As a physician, I think single-payer is a good idea. I don't think I'd be in that situation if I were to die right now and had to have a doctor visit.

If we can get something done, we can get it.

Metallix87: It'll probably work. Single-payer would be better, but the costs would be higher, and the benefits to the American people would be less.
-----
Waffles: You can't pollute the country's resources properly, and the single payer system is not an option.

It's pretty short and I think it's pretty interesting. Joe is a Trump apologist with a lot of left leaning views on the world and some of his best guests have been Trump himself.

My overall feeling is that the nominees are:
1. Lucio Fulci’s Stand Up Comedy
2. Eric Forman's American Choir (featuring Jon Favreau and Tiffany Haddish)
3. Sam Harris’ Settle the Music Baby
4. David Byrne’s A Color Me [Full Color]
5. The Eagles Inn
6. Neil Young’s Thriller
7. The Rolling Stones’ Thriller (featuring Ben Warburton and Kurt Von Over), “The Evening”, and “The Band Is Free to Go”
8. The VVitch, Elton John’s Long Time [The Greatest Showman], and “The Night”
9. Radiohead’s Four Tetralogy
10. The Cure’s The Daydreams [Live to Death],” but I’ll admit to having a soft spot for most of Neil Young’s output.
Honorable mention goes to:
The Zombies’ The Good Life [Nightmare], “The Way I Lie,” and “The Wailing (A.K.A. Neo),” which I actually love.
