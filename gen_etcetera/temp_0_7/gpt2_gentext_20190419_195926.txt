~!~The next DEATH BATTLE is Carnage (Marvel Comics) vs Lucy (Marvel Comics Black Cat)

TheGamingNewsGuy: Revealed at the end of Samurai Jack vs Carnage. Which one will be your next VS and what will be your opponent(s)?
-----
Scavenger: I think Carnage would prefer Lucy.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: It's obviously a fair competition but I think Carnage is a little bit more 'Nutty' in the way they just kill him.
-----
FF Seraphim: I’ll admit it’s completely meh on the Carnage formula. If Carnage can’t kill Black Cat then yeah I’ll take him.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Lucy would prefer Carnage but Carnage is a little more 'nutty' in the way they just kill him.
-----
Miso: This is a no contest.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Oh ok
-----
Chrno: I like Carnage, but I'll take him over Black Cat.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think Carnage has more personality and is more at home in the Savage universe and at the same time easier to kill
-----
FF Seraphim: Seems a bit hedged that his fight with Carnage takes place in Savage which is a real rarity.

Rent control in most major cities in the US has led to a major housing crisis and a ton of renters being homeless.
It seems the solution might be to build affordable homes in major cities, which would lead to thousands of renters competing for a place.

~!~Why does it seem like the '80s is nowhere near the '90s?

Geirskogul: I think this thread is pretty self-explanatory, and is at least entertaining discussion. To be clear, I'm talking about the '80s, not the '90s.
I remember the decade being weirdly progressive and very optimistic at the time. I remember being very young, Mexican, and very American at the time, and being very young, Mexican, and American. I also remember being very young and American, but not very young. I also remember that I never thought we'd see the mainstream of our media, and I even thought we'd get hit by a lot of bad press over the decade.
But the '80s seemed like a pretty clean decade, too. The Cold War was over, the media was on its knees, the media was investing in the right to destroy the GOP, and the political scene was generally pretty good. I'm not talking about '99 and 2000s anymore, but the decade between '90 and '00 was cleaner. There were plenty of good years during the decade, for sure.
But the '80s was a very dull decade, even on a subjective sense of "good times". I do remember that it was very distinct from the '00s, and I do also remember that people were more accepting of a political and social revolution than were the 00s.
So, in essence, what is the '80s? It seems to me that the '90s were a very "safe" decade, where everything was going great, it was just a different era, and everything seemed to be getting better.
But the '80s have been very dark and depressing at times, and it seems that that '90 has been very divisive and messy at times.
So I wonder if the general consensus of the decade is that things are moving very differently, with things not being what they seem?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: The late 80s were a very dark time.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I don't think so.
-----
Cipherr: It was dark. It wasn't a dark time where you were voting for a far-right government, and then the consequences of it were immense and the consequences of it were far greater than you were affected to be fair. 
Even today we have racism, bigotry

It feels like the right guy but I’ll do my part.

~!~Help me understand how this site seems to work

Naked Koopa: I have been trying to master my D&D game for a few months now. I don't know how to go about it because I don't know how to go about it and I spend a lot of time looking up and down these pages. Something that keeps me interested in the game is that if I understand one particular thing about it, it keeps me informed about the rest of it. For example, I read a lot of D&D's in high school during my first year, but one of my favorite books I read for Christmas was "The Road to El Dorado". I was reading a book about how El Dorado is a place that is kind of behind the scenes and that kind of looks like tourist trap. I'm a big nerd about videogames but in high school I was probably read 50 stories a semester. Then one day I was reading through the El Dorado page and I was like "wow that's scary" and I did some research on it and it seems to be mostly about the small city. I thought maybe maybe maybe it is a tourist trap because I am a veteran and I go there and look for more jobs but then I realized that if I go there, I am in the same city and it is like a tourist trap.
I understand that it might be a bit creepy but I rather not look for anything that can be explained in a dark page. I think I understand the idea of the game better than D&D but I just want to understand what is the deal with it?
-----
Atenhaus: Are you trying to learn a language? Are you trying to learn a language?
-----
Naked Koopa: No I just want to have that as a start. I had this issue with some games like Pokemon. It would take me a while to get anywhere and there are some annoying mechanics that would keep me from getting it.
-----
Atenhaus: Yeah I'm not sure if it is just the forum or a lack of understanding or a lack of time or something but I think the point of the game would be to find a way to get the level of lore and lore read to you. That is how I have been able to get to certain levels of gear without being a bad gamer and I feel like that it is a good way to make those higher levels of lore read to you.

~!~Athletic Wrestling is looking to hire some

TheGhost: I know it's not mainstream wrestling but when I was in high school my wrestling class was a junior and out of the building. I don't know why but I went to see a video of them wrestle in the ring Saturday night.
The kid was also on his iPad, and if you look at the video you can see he's not wearing a seatbelt at all.
The guy says he is taking a break and will be signing with us after this week so we will interview.
He's taking a break because he has been a wrestling fan ever since then and this is all new to him. We are talking to him right now and I want to ask about his wrestling background.
Also his brother is a wrestling fan and his brother is the guy in the video.
Just wanted to get a chance to interview him and see what the hell he's smoking.

Razgriz417: This is good news for WWE and all the fans that watch.

linkboy: That's a talent so young. I'm pretty sure they have to make room for him if they want him.

Televator: That's all I got for now.
-----
TheGhost: I'm just waiting for him to do a quick interview before taking legal action.
-----
TheGhost: He's been in a lot of matches and it's apparent he's good mentally
-----
Dr.Acula: Is this a joke?
-----
TheGhost: I'm pretty sure I think it is.
-----
ruggiex: Hasn't a talent like this ever been a draw in the history of wrestling? I mean, that's not even a draw.
-----
TheGhost: Not sure how you take it. I think the angle was "The guy was taking a break", he was wearing a seat belt.

I click on some random random "news" flashout and it's something I guess, but something about the site feels different. Something about the site feels like a clickbait site, like a fake news site. What I want to know is what sites are, and are they legit?

Dekuman: It's about time someone updated the "Bail Bond" formula.

~!~What the hell is going on with the internet these days?

Krejlooc: To just put it plainly, what is going on with the internet these days? It's like the internet is just a huge joke hole. Most of the jokes are in the form of links or memes, unless you're watching a youtube video or even have a tablet, they're all around ridiculous.
I'm trying to laugh at this thread for the most part now, but lately, I'm starting to get a little despondent when it comes to actually laughing at whatever they're doing
-----
Krejlooc: I don't think I've ever been this tired of internet humor in weeks straight. I can't even get the jokes to work. I got a couple of my memes mixed up with my real life accounts, but I don't see how I'm being serious.
-----
Krejlooc: You're not being serious. You're being incredibly deluded.
-----
GameAddict411: It has been going on for a while now. I started noticing it a while ago and now. It's really not funny. You can see it being very dark on sites like reddit. I'm a white guy. I can't even be that serious about something. I think there are a couple memes that are just offensive and offensive. I don't even see how you can get more serious about something in just a few minutes.
-----
Krejlooc: I've noticed it's been going on for the last year. And no, I'm not joking. I'm not joking. I've been in this state that humor has gone from lighthearted to dark and now I'm more deluded with how we consume it.
-----
CormoranStrike: It's like the internet has slowly gotten heavy handed. I love memes but I also love dark humor. I like dark humor, but I also understand the concept of memes. I've never been a dark humorist.

Krejlooc: See, I'm fucking stumped. No one is really laughing but I can see a few people being serious. I'm not being serious here. I can't even get serious jokes mixed up with my memes, but I'm not going to post a webcomic while drunk.

~!~How long until we learn not to smile?

AdaWong: Like I said, I know that we can learn from past experiences, but I'm wondering... how long does this kind of thing happen? Once, a few months before Christmas, I was in a traffic accident, but I was asked to pay for a Lyft. I didn't want to, for one, because I had to pay for a Lyft, but I didn't want to because I was injured and I didn't want to because I was dead and I didn't want to because I couldn't give a shit about my family and my teenage son. I thought I was dead, but I was alive when I died.
How long does this kind of thing happen throughout life? When I was a kid, I was always obnoxiously loud and obnoxiously angry. When I was a teenager I didn't mind people growing inside my body, but I didn't mind people growing out inside it either. I just wanted to shut it down and not be judged.
-----
Halo 2: I never got mad at my family, but now that I'm older, I do what I can to be more calm when sharing my thoughts.
-----
GrizzleBoy: I don't think we're going to become so obnoxiously angry when we die, we might as well become really stupid and turn into automots.
Not sure how it happened to me, but I was still very polite.
-----
Doomguy Fieri: I think that this is probably normal. We've evolved to be conditioned to avoid confrontation.
-----
RadzPrower: I had this problem for a bit as well. My family would always try to get along with me, but I refused to talk to them. I thought I was too stupid to fight them about it. And I was very afraid and thought my family had all the power in this world.
-----
theofficefan99: I've been super stressed out the last few months trying to get out of my house. I'm getting some anxiety and I'm getting super stressed about what I'm doing and how I can improve.

~!~I'm a pretty tall and skinny dude and don't know what to do about my hair 

TheGhost: So I have a very short dreadlock. It's a style that I have always been aware of, but never really practiced with until recently. Hair isn't a tonic, but I had a conversation with my stylist who told me I should get a thick one. I have a lot of dreads and it's starting to get noticeable. I'm not sure what to do about it. Has anyone else dealt with this as I have some no-name experience? I can't really lie when I say I'm skinny but I'm finding it to be a net positive. I'm 6'2" and I have a lot of noticeable hair loss and thinning. Is there any way to deal with it? Has anyone else dealt with this as well? I'm wondering if I can find a friend in my area or if this is something I should keep an eye on and if I should go balding test.
-----
Eloquent: Go see a doctor and find a different stylist, some stylist might just be a coincidence.
-----
Seesaw15: Don't go bald. Just trim it a little and see how it grows out.
-----
jb1234: Go see a doctor.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Go to a different stylist.
-----
Mendinso: The best advice I can give is to always go bald if possible. It's such a barbaric no-good.
You seem like a good guy. I would suggest a haircut. You'll be growing a lot and it will help with the thin hair.
Just be careful with tips though. You'll grow a lot and it will take some time to reach the correct length, but a haircut will help keep you mellower.
-----
TheGhost: I didn't mean to bump my head, I'm just curious why

NamelessNamekian: My brother has a very long one too, almost a foot shorter than mine. I trim it almost every day, but it's really getting annoying. It's also really bad, I can't imagine how it'll get better. It's that finicky feeling when you just walk away from it all the time, and then you start to feel like you started from a dead beginning.

~!~The Weeknd announced an album with B.I.G. - A Brief Inquiry Into His Living World

signal: Weeknd previewed it at his first concert back in 2016 with Stars - A Billion Dreams and A Brief Inquiry in their London Show preview. So this is no mere preview. Weeknd is back and is teasing a new album exclusively on his Tidal.
The Weeknd's first major solo concert in London was him at the end of last year. In the year, he released 4 albums and a solo album under the name B.I.G., which is technically a soloer. Since then, he's been in several major festivals, including four Grammys (including the first prize) and a Coachella festival (all winners were announced the day before release). B.I.G. has been his second festival since leaving Grammys support Jason Mraz dropped off after a decade on the road.
The Weeknd's first major solo concert in London was in 2016, in a mostly empty venue (no capacity). It was a fairly solid showing, and he was mostly a blast. I'd say it's a sign that he's gotten more into the lifestyle. B.I.G.'s second year was probably peak Weeknd for him, and his music is certainly more in the public spotlight.
-----
Truly Gargantuan: I still don't know what to think.
-----
signal: I think B.I.G released 3 albums in 2017? It was his first major solo release since his solo one for his first album with Blackpink. 
But it's pretty impressive how much he's grown as a person and has developed as a person. I'm more excited for it though. I'll gladly listen to the conclusion of B.I.G.

Grizzel Greedigut: I have to listen to more Ariana Grande.

~!~How do you moderate your time spent online?

entremet: I live in the SF Bay Area and my old roommate started to get into gaming about 4 years ago. He quit after a few months. He didn't quit because he didn't like the way he was progressing into the genre, he quit because he started gaming too. He ended up finding a new hobby and started running tournaments for the last couple years.
I'm trying to get him to actually go out of his way to check out League of Legends now. He's on Twitch now and I just want to explore it and get him hooked. I'd like to do that before he goes into a new hobby.
How do you moderate your time online?

TheFireman: I get into online gaming way too fast. When I was on the toilet, I'd wander through the toilet thread or community threads. Nowadays I just go to the gaming section or the OT.

TheBeardedOne: I read a ton of novels a year, mostly from time to time. I use imagination a lot, and read a lot of horror (most of which I won't write about myself). I'm also a big reader of horror novels, which helps me keep up with the industry.
I also have a habit of reading a lot of horror novels, but I don't read the genre as much as much as I used to. I read about 10-15 horror novels a year.

I'm really bad at reading. I don't quite understand the point of my time to be honest. I'm trying to learn to read more but I'd like to learn to read less.

Drain You: I like to read but I like to limit myself to like 40-50 hours a day. There's something to be learned about gaming side of things, I guess.

I've been dating for like six months now and she's being very persistent and in poor health and I'm just so frustrated. I'm in a very bad place right now. I'm traveling to Arizona for a few days and I need to get out of this country. I've spent my last three months drinking and smoking weed while drinking and I'm just so sick of this shit. I'm seriously considering suicide or I would be so fucking sick. I've been going to therapy and I just can't anymore. I feel like I have no control over this shit. Like, I'm the same as my friends. I'm 24 and I'm sick of this shit. I have no friends and I don't know anybody. I feel like I'm the only person in my life who can help me. I don't know why I'm even here. I'm not going to help myself. I'm not going to let my friend die of a heroin overdose. I'm just so sick of this shit.

~!~Kuroko no Basket (Naruto) is the best OVA of 2017

AnansiThePersona: I haven't watched the 2017 Naruto OVA, but I've watched the entirety of the 2017 Naruto Shippuden anime. I've watched most of the episodes, and I've been meaning to watch more of the 2017 Naruto Shippuden anime.
Hearing the 2017 Naruto Shippuden anime was very interesting. The clean ending, the whole "Uchiha is canon to all other shinobi, all other ninjas who happen to be berserkers are shonen bullshit" attitude of the main character, the whole "Uchuukyaku Sumo (literally 'god of the dead')' ending, the whole "Kakashi Kakuin (be my neighbor) is canon to all other shinobi who happen to be berserkers' is pretty good too.
I really liked how Kono and company were using the Sharingan to resurrect their dead friends, the idea of Kabuto being revived was neat. Seeing Naruto and company just resurrect their dead friends and not making any new ones was neat. Seeing them basically just resurrect their dead friends was neat. Kishimoto really honed in on the Shadow Clone, seeing them use the Sharingan to revive Genos using it as a sort of psionic healing agent was neat. I really enjoyed seeing the rest of the anime, but seeing the anime itself, I feel like it's not all that great.
It's really weird how much better the Shonen Sharingan is for the show-line than the original, it's more interesting seeing a lot of the parallels there between the two, and seeing what connections there are to the original, even seeing the differences in the show-line but not the conclusion of the shinobi world because it's all about the Shadow Clone, the ending of the anime is really cool to see. The first episode is the least bad, the art-style is really weird, even though I thought the show-line was great, I actually liked the art-style-of-Uchiha a lot, the show-line is really good, and then the end has some pretty weird inconsistencies and stuff. The show-line is pretty consistent, for example the Kakashi Pan form is weird, the weirdest Shonen thing is the

~!~How would you feel about a reboot of the Doctor Who universe?

malyse: I feel like a lot of people are excited for the new Doctor Who (yes, old Doctor Who), but I can't think of any other series in which a new Doctor Who could be established as a franchise.
For me, I'd be tempted to say that I didn't enjoy the series at all, but I think it was fun, made it into the Christmas season, and became a genuinely good Christmas movie.
Who'd you like to see rebooted?
-----
sir_crocodile: reboot by the fans obviously, but I would love it to stay the same universe
-----
Dennis8K: A reboot by the fans would be great.

Creamium: I would love a new Doctor, but I would probably like a new Doctor who can be popular and take off after 20 years.

Thurston Last: New Doctor, but I wonder what will replace him.
-----
Dice: His role in all of these stories would be far less important than the role of the superior incarnation.

Plywood: A new Doctor would be cool.

chandoog: A reboot without the Gallifrey character would be silly.

Khanimus: It'd be dumb and bland, and I'd hate it. I think they could do a series of things like shrink-wrapped figures, set up in the future, but set in the present.

~!~What is your favourite time of the year?

TearablePuns: Here in Japan it's raining quite a bit and the weather is pretty bad. So I thought I'd post some weather stuff. I'll start with this
For me this year it was a rain storm. I thought it was going to rain at some point during the year, but man the last two days I had to get up for work and get dressed for the rain. Then it suddenly stopped raining, but only a half day later when I got home I opened the door and it was clear. Went outside to take a bath and while doing my favourite hobby of playing games I realized a water hose had fallen on my face. I started sweating, I had a sore stiff neck and a headache but I was in shock. Then I woke up to a headache and I thought I had really bad acid reflux. It was bad, but I got the flu from eating at a restaurant. So I went home and made my bed.
In the morning I found my wife walking down a path and a perfectly normal person would have just walked past one of the path's, walked past another, and then walked a third. But I didn't. I was in such a bad place, I thought for the first time I'd pissed myself.
The next day was a good day for me, I was in the hospital. It was a bit painful, but I had a bad sore neck. It took a couple of weeks for me to recover and the pain was still there. But it eventually stopped when the temps dropped a bit and there was still no rain.
So what about you?
-----
John Kowalski: It's raining right now.

Miso: It's raining for the 100th time in like a week.

TheBeardedOne: It's raining right now.

~!~Athlon: A Band's New Album, "Tipps From The Hoodie"

Droyd: Finally!
I was just listening to the new album yesterday, and holy hell what a great album. The last two were released as singles, and I was surprised at the level of detail they show.
Athlon is a band that started in 2007, and has been in heavy rotation for years. They have a couple other albums coming up, and I hope we get some more new stuff out there.
Can't believe I never listened to a new album until now.
Thoughts?
P.S. I also didn't know there was a new album coming out.
-----
StuBurns: I don't know if I'd call this "album-phishing," but if you're going to keep your "with a new album" bullshit, keep it to a minimum.
-----
AlteredBeast: I have a friend who went through a similar phase during the last few years. Back in the 90s, there were no albums, and instead listened to whatever came out. She is still around now and was not a fan of the new albums. Many of them are quite similar to the ones we all had, but the songs themselves are just different.
-----
Gattsu25: The last album was fine, but that new one is pretty different. I'd recommend giving them more consideration.
-----
Aurongel: I didn't really care for the new album at all. Too many tracks started to get repetitive and the solo leads were a bit hollow.
-----
Timbuktu: I can't imagine anyone mixing Thriller with A Thumb in 2019, but I think that's part of the problem. The songs are a bit like early-2000s pop, but they're not a huge revelation.
-----
davidnolan13: No one really listened to a new album until now.
-----
Laserdisk: I still remember the new one being so repetitive it was hard to tell.
-----
DarkCronos: It's a good album, but it's not one of my favorite, but it's good.
And I thought the new one was good but not great.

We've never done this before and I'm curious if any of you have a similar suggestion. We've already bought games like a Mega Man skin and a Mega Man 4 skin.

We've bought a bunch of games in the last couple months too, but we've also bought games from reputable sellers and websites.

~!~The Green Book was not created by the right people

lazygecko: The Green Book was created by the right people. It's widely regarded as one of the best movies ever made about the early 1900s Pittsburgh, which is why so many people were disgusted that it was only nominated for a motion picture nom. Since then, it has been criticized for being alarmist propaganda and being a deep look at fascism.
However, you can't just chalk in a movie like this to the right's attempt to paint Green Book as some sort of historical accurate history lesson. Instead, it's been called a criticism of the movie as representative of the culture in general.
-----
Slayven: Thats the point of the argument. The green book is more about the wayside.
-----
Khanimus: I didn't like Green Book.
The movie is a fucking punching bag of the racist right.
-----
Dennis8K: I don't know if I would say "medieval propaganda" but the movie is a great example on how far right it can be in portraying it.
-----
Vincent Alexander: I don't even know if I would say censoring things like movies or internet censorship, but I can easily think of some racist right wing who can do anything fascist without consequence being the end goal.
-----
Slayven: I think the movie is about how far right it can be
-----
InspectaDekka: You said history not so long ago, but I'm referring to the movies.
-----
lazygecko: I think this is a case of a movie invading the minds of a new generation of people who normally would have been influenced by historical propaganda.
-----
Dennis8K: I would say censorship. I think it is a more apt name.
-----
WrenchNinja: The movie is a classic but the early 1900s are certainly far far right.

~!~What's going on with the latest Star Wars film?

Hal9001: I'm on the last episode of season 2 of the new Star Wars show and I find it hard to pinpoint what the latest Star Wars film is all about. I know the film is not the best by any means, but I am pretty sure it hasn't really been that popular in recent years and that it has only been around for like three or four years now. What are some recent movies that are being made and what do you think they are all about?
-----
Khanimus: I'm not a fan of the new trilogy, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who's seen some great stuff.
-----
Cheebo: The current Star Wars movies are... questionable. They are indeed fun movies but a mixed bag. They are not bad films and are not quite my favorite Star Wars overall but maybe part of that is due to the lackluster sequel stuff which I also dislike. It's not that I dislike the movies in general at all.
-----
Shugga: Trailer is awful but it's hype
-----
Moncho GX: TLOTR and fuck with this movie.
-----
shnurgleton: I feel like the new trilogy is a bit boring. The new one has good ideas, but the old one's is just bad.
There's another trilogy coming in soon that's much better though.
-----
Ultima_5: TLOTR
-----
Slayven: You are in for a treat OP.
-----
Sephzilla: I'm not a fan of the new trilogy. I think the problem is that it's not a trilogy and has good ideas but it's not canon.

Sephzilla: A new trilogy of three with new characters with the same plot and a good cast is the best way to get the plot going once it gets going.

~!~What is your favorite place to buy clothes online?

entremet: I'm a bit of a casual person, but I buy a bunch of clothes online and I'm always in the mood for some comfortable stuff. However, I don't buy new clothes regularly. For instance, I bought a bunch of shirts on Amazon UK this past December:
A few years ago, I wanted to buy a more stylish set of pants, but I could never get into the style I was into. So I picked up a couple of pairs of pants from a local store. 
I'm really happy with these pants, so far my favourite pair is definitely the one I've got so the zipper is perfect. However, they're so long it looks like the back of the pants hits the floor. Seems to be one of those very long pants that I would love to wear for a while.
I'm not really interested in fashion as I don't buy clothes very often. I don't know what it is I'm doing, but I'm curious about it. Anyone have any suggestions?
-----
shadowsdarknes: I bought some shoes online for $100.
I love them, but I don't buy the style often.
-----
The Albatross: Buy a pair of these.
They are really great, but I make sure the back of the pants is the same way as the top or top of the shoe is too high (most sneaker-packing people don't care about this).
-----
entremet: Yeah, you want to make sure. That's my general recommendation, but I've never bought anything from them.
-----
RolandOfGilead: I bought a bunch of suit and tie from Suit Supply for $100. I bought some shirt from Amazon.
I love these things.
-----
Forearm_Star: I bought some clothes online for $100 and they are very nice.

Deleted member 25709: I'm not American and I don't live in Canada. I just want to see what the results of the Supreme Court will be.

Volimar: No. The only thing the second amendment does is allow the government to kick ass when it feels right. If you kick up a fence, you can expect the government to do it anyway.
-----
Transistor: No.
The first amendment is more important than any other kind of change. The reason the second is important is because it allows the GOP to have a conversation on spending and taxes while also passing sensible, sensible legislation. Even if they kick up a fence, you shouldn't be able to expect the government to just kick up a wall.

guek: I'm not really into musicals but I'm interested in exploring what are the best overall (or even best) audio/video/synthpop for movies.
What are your favorite examples of a movie's musical theme and/or lyrics? I'll list my top 10.
Black Swan - A Space Odyssey
It's not even that I love the song, I love it.
Star Wars - The Empire Strikes Back
Directed by Fulci, also this is the third Cloverfield movie I've seen.
Bojack Horseman - A Christmas Story
This is the first Pixar movie I've seen.
The Princess Who Came For Christmas (2016)
This movie is basically a mix of The Princess Who Came For Christmas and The Snowman Cometh. I didn't know this was considered a Synopsis song, I thought it was a great Disney song.
Wild Wild West - The Deer Hunter
The best Disney song ever written
Ralph Breaks the Internet ( 1993)
I thought this was a great Disney song, but I'm not sure if it's actually a Synopsis track. I'll leave it as is.

shnurgleton: My name is Harry and I am nothing -

~!~The most overrated and under appreciated films of 2017

Flow: Inspired by the thread about under appreciated films of 2017, I present to you the films that were under appreciated and beloved by millions of people worldwide.
Shows like The Phantom Menace, 20th Century Fox's The Fent, and The Post.
As someone who is also a huge Star Wars fan, I can't think of anything more overrated than those movies.
So, ERA, what films have you watched that you feel are under appreciated and under appreciated?
Note: My choice is probably Prisoners. I love everything about the movie and it has become one of my favorite comedies ever.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Prisoner, but I saw it at a local Blockbuster and it was a pretty good rental.
-----
Switch Back 9: The Lego Batman Movie. I saw it in a theater.
-----
Flow: I also saw it in a local Blockbuster and it was a pretty good rental.
-----
shnurgleton: Toy Story 3
Toy Story 2
The Matrix
The Passion of Tomatoes
The Color of Christmas
The Accountant
The Post
The Greatest Showman
The Fent
The Twilight Zone
Beverly Hills Cop
and probably a lot more
-----
sooperkool: Transformers: The Last Knight is the under appreciated classic. No idea why it was overlooked.
-----
Liquid Plejades: Phantom Menace
-----
zombiejames: The Dark Knight
-----
dancingphlower: 20th century Fox
-----
Flow: 20th century Fox

~!~A friend of mine just bought this car. Should I care?

FernandoRocker: Was in Los Angeles today and I went to buy it.
The price was right, the warranty was a month long, and the car was certified.
I was very disappointed, but I was also very happy.
I'm glad you linked me to one of my favorite places in the world:
Buying for someone else
I actually have a car that I used to drive to get a good warranty, but I'm so happy that it's been covered.
I wasn't expecting this to happen in 2018, but I'm very pleased that it happened.
-----
FUME5: The car is pretty new.
-----
FernandoRocker: Yes, even with the warranty.
-----
Fiction: I used a Tesla before this car was certified, I bought it off a used car for $250k on Craigslist.
You can get a hold of a certified certified certified certified certified certified for a good price.
-----
feline fury: The battery is a good old story, but the price was too good to pass up. So you might get a hold of a certified certified certified certified at some point.
-----
Hycran: It’s a pretty small car. When the price was right it was chump for the status quo.
-----
FernandoRocker: I'd say it's a good price until it goes under, but I'm looking at a C-Class EV now.
-----
Fiction: But I really wanted a Tesla, so I bought it.
-----
FernandoRocker: Yeah. I'd have bought a nicer car before it, but I'm not too happy with the specs. I have a 2006 Toyota Matrix 3.
-----
Fiction: So like that, doesn't that mean it's certified and has good performance?

~!~How long do you keep your old phone?

Coraline Jones: I was growing up. I didn't really understand why I had a camera, so I gave my parents a 2006 SE 2, which they had never had before, and my dad had a 2006 SE 3. The camera was fantastic. Didn't need the RAM and they were fine.
My current plan is:
- Have an old phone (iPhone, iPhone SE, iPhone X) that I use constantly. I put it in the shower once and it does all the chores.
- One of the first phones to come with a smart cable.
- One of the first phones to have a headphone jack.
I was wondering if any of you have old phones, if you have a new phone, and if you need to know how to keep yours from dying out.
-----
sir wallace walrus: I have a 2013 iPhone. Still rocking 60% with it.
-----
Powdered Egg: I have a battery pack inside a case, but I never had an SD card slot in my life.
-----
butalala: I keep my old phone in a wrapper, unzipped, wrapped in a newspaper, and keep it in the fridge as a gag...and a reminder that it's not worth the time.
-----
Powdered Egg: That's why I have a trashy to get rid of iPhone I leave in the fridge for months.
-----

I am a Bird: I used to keep old phones in the back room of my parents house near the fire. Bad enough to be thrown in the trash.
-----
sir wallace walrus: That's why I got a trashy.
-----
Powdered Egg: I'll never be rid of another phone. I have the iPhone X I got for $500 from eBay.

~!~Is it possible to get a kick out of a track from an animated movie?

Slayven: I have no doubt that the majority of the Jackie Chan track from The Legend of Jackie Brown is some of the most poorly produced track from the animated series. I mean it's Jackie Brown 2.0 with those two tracks being the best parts of the series.
-----
Powdered Egg: I don't know about it, but the Legend of Jackie Brown.
-----
Richter1887: Yes, even though I have seen and listened to the whole series before.
-----
Slayven: I am thinking of buying a used VHS though
-----
Slayven: I don't think that was the main complaint with the Legend of Jackie Brown
-----
TheRedSnifit: Yeah, but I just heard them play so many different songs.
-----
Rackham: Not to mention there are some horrible songs.
-----
Grimm Fandango: Yes, the Legend of Jackie Brown is a masterpiece.

Richter1887: Yeah, I have heard the Legend of Jackie Brown songs better when not seen.

TheRedSnifit: I don't know how I'm supposed to top this.

~!~The Nuclear Escape (1994)

DiscoPizza: I loved that movie. The ending in particular felt like a bizarre reverse Ghost Dog version of the previous movie, and the fact that the protagonist was actually the one escaping was hilariously foreshadowed.
What are some other great movie trailers?
-----
Medalion: Kinda dreading it... but I like the movie and the ending
-----
Sega Dreamcast: I'm so down for this.

HStallion: I'm more than happy that the film is actually good. I hope they don't do this to any of the remakes.

I'm so down asap.

~!~I'm not convinced that anyone I know is watching the NFL.

Deception: I'm in a strange situation here and I need to vent.
I'm a 37 year old Male. I have a degree in Computer Science and have a job in IT right now. I work full time and I have a part time apartment. I'm living with my girlfriend who has a gf for the month and then I'm in a home.
I'm not convinced that anyone is watching the game.
Anyone else has similar encounters?
-----
Deception: I've lost interest in watching the NFL. The only thing I can think of is that I'm really into analytics and I really like fantasy football.
-----
TheJackdog: i believe that the league is just so deep in the system thats easy to spread around to everyone and that the training is just so easy
-----
BDS: I watched the first two playoffs of the NFL and I'm pretty sure I've watched every quarter or so, for the entire season. I'm pretty disappointed.
-----
Deception: I've watched all of them. I am a male.
The one that I do not believe is how hard is to spread the team's spread evenly throughout the teams. I've been watching it for years and I'm not sure how hard that is.
-----
BDS: I know that you're not convinced and I'm here to help you out. I'm here to help you.
-----
m0therzer0: The only other thing I can think of is that I watch almost every team I can. I am not ten feet away from having a conversation about how I thought they were playing.
-----
andymcc: we have a dedicated OT for the NFL. 
the rest of the OT is just a repository for the league conversation.
-----
Deception: That's a good idea, thank you. Maybe we can start talking about that for a future meeting.

~!~Why is it a bad idea to take out an entire lawn outside when you could just sit down and relax?

ToddBonzalez: So I live in the suburbs and I've been brainstorming a new lawn design. I don't know how much it would cost to do this, but I have no idea. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I really want to see the results I can get out of it. My question is, why is it such a bad idea to take out the entire lawn outside when you could just sit down and relax and just surf the web while doing your gardening?
I don't know how much it would cost to do this in the first place, but it sounds like you need to invest in dedicated lawns.
-----
Dicer: Wouldn't be hard to just take out the lawn for the internet, just like we should for our backyard.
-----
ZOONAMI: Why wouldn't it be bad to just take the lawn outside?
Why not just take it outside?
-----
Cybersai: Because it's not worth it to repair your lawn if it's a lawn that's in poor condition.
-----
ZOONAMI: Yeah it'd be too much work.
-----
RoadDogg: I bought 6 lawns for my new house and when I was buying a home I made sure my house had dedicated lawns to take care of. My neighbors had a big garden. So I made sure all my lawns had a gate for the outside.
-----
Fliesen: Because it's cheaper than doing the whole house-bouler thing. (I bought a small little garden to test it, but it's really too small for my garden, and the outside of my house is really nice, so I decided to add more, outside of my garden being very big, I decided to add more outside gardens...).
At the moment it's not cost-effective to just take a grasspile to the outside of a house, or even just take a whole house to the outside.
-----
Horseticuffs: I'm not sure I can live with myself, but it seems like a better idea to not take a grasspit to the outside of your area if you can live with yourself.
-----
TarpitCarnivore: Uh...why not just go outside? If it's surrounded by trees/grass,
====================
~!~Why are there so many "what ifs" in your life?

TissueBox: So, I'm not going to go in any detail about the context of the thread, because I'm going to focus on what I personally feel would be a "what if" scenario, as that would be, at best, very inappropriate, and at worst, extremely depressing.
But I do feel like there are aspects of your life that you will "see" as a "what if." The "what if" elements I think are the most... volatile... things that you will never see as an alternative!
The first is your relationship. You will always have a core group of friends, family, and SOs. Or maybe you will still be in touch with the family and/or the SOs when it gets dark/suspicious/etc. The core group of friends/family are the "what ifs." The smallest, smallest thing that happen to you would probablynt even affect your life in anyway of course.
The rest is clutch. The only thing that can make or break a relationship is the smallest thing that can possibly get you to do something that you otherwise wouldn't have done if you were together with the person you were apart from for some time or for that matter. It's the "what if."
Now, for me personally, I would say there are a few instances I see as "what ifs." One of them was my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm not 100% married and we've been together for about 10 years and we both have a couple of kids together as well. I don't know how it works, but I just deal with her stuff all day as if it's going to affect me negatively, and she's basically the one that gets emotional about it. And I had a few situations where we did interact, and it was good for the kids but the relationship ended with absolutely no end in sight. 
The other one was my girlfriend's family, in general I really hung out with her, and we were just friendly ribbing and good laughs. It was all friendly ribbing, but we did also have some crying moments that made the kids uncomfortable. I mean we both had tears in our eyes in our eyes, but I just didn't want to bring it up in front of them because I felt really uncomfortable to be around her. I just felt really bad for her and I just wanted to vent

This is one of the better examples I can think of.
-----
Mona: i remember seeing this on the old site
she is the voice of the main character
-----
Jombie: That's a new one!

Darryl M R: A more correct answer would be Sera. She's a woman who has ambition and great determination but also a very judgmental and self-loathing person who has a drinking problem and a husband with a newborn daughter. She is also voiced by George Clooney.

What's yours?

~!~Please tell me about the best anime in the past decade

Jadow: The past decade has seen me go back and watch anime again, I have seen many shows I enjoyed from the 80's to the present day, like Attack on Titan, Chowder, Inuyashizashi, Gun or Gatchaman Crowds, but I still have myself to be surprised by what comes next. I like adaptions of manga and Anime, I like to look forward to new things, I like to look back and look back, I like to look back at all shows I've watched from the previous decade, I just don't like to buy stuff again. Just a few things I really enjoyed:
Naruto (rewrite of the ninja series)
Oyashiro-san is really good and really good looking. The whole series is like a giant Ocean of Time-like body.
Itachi and One Piece (okay the story on its own could be different)
I don't know about the rest, but the arcs in the series are amazing, like the whole Marine Arches-esque conflict at the end that's super ahead of its time.
Oyashiro-san is a good guy, but I don't like him in the main cast.
The new adaptation of Berserk
Berserk coming to an end? I don't know about the rest
Itachi-san is the best
Itachi-man is a good guy, but I don't like him in the main cast.
Attack on Titan coming back? I don't know about the rest.
Attack on Titan coming to an end? I don't know about the rest.
Oh yeah and I'm just curious about what all the above would be. If the above three things were the top two, would it be the next best anime after...?
-----
Grexeno: I don't think it's the best anime, but it's the most influential.
-----
TheGreatDirector: It's the best adaptation of Berserk.
-----
Dekuman: No manga that isn’t bad?
-----
Rover: It is the best adaptation of the manga.
-----
Khanimus: No real competition between the three (I know, I know... they're not the best thing ever).

~!~What are you reading this week?

Rivenblade: I'm going to be working on a lot of stuff, mainly in the areas of anatomy, demographics, and social issues. I've got a lot of material planned for the next weeks, so I figured I'd start with what I learned in pre-med school and then move onto more material later. I'm going to be studying anatomy (maybe have a look before you make your move), anthropology (maybe), and developmental studies (maybe). I'm also going to be doing a lot of reading on the intersections of sexuality and gender since it's important to me to understand more about sexual behavior and societal norms in societies. I'm going to do some handouts to thank you for, and I'm going to also be spending time with my daughter in her home.
Also, I completely missed most of history, since I've been reading it during the break.
Also, I am going to finish compiling every paper I've written since 2012. I'm going to finish the compilation trilogy (the first 2 volumes are out), the first 3 are out, the last 3 are out and I still haven't gotten round the covers one by one.
So, ERA, what are you reading this week?
-----
Drain You: I'm only a week into undergrad, so I'm going to finish the homeworks for the first class I'm going to take. I'm not sure when exactly classes will be called out on Wednesday since I'm taking no real classes until the holidays.
-----
Sectorseven: I'm a bit of a history buff so I'll be reading a bit of the textbook midterm week.
-----
Rivenblade: Yeah, I'll be taking some tests soon. I just finished up two chapters on the Human Brain and it's fascinating reading about Albert Einstein.
-----
Rivenblade: We're reading "The Alchemist" this weekend and "The mind behind Elon Musk" next weekend. I think that's a good time.
-----
JaeCryo: I'm a history buff so I will be finishing White Collar Age and Age of Ultron during the break.

~!~Latest Apple disaster: repair of wrong product on iMac

HylianSeven: I am using a refurb iMac for the holidays, bought a refurbished one from them and reinstalled the OS. Now I want to repair my iPhone 7, which is a custom iMac. The problem is that my display is no longer the same size on both sides with the top edge panel removed. I want to repair the display and it wants to come off the back of the board.
The problem is that the ID on the top panel is no longer the same as on the bottom panel. I have to use the bottom one and I have to touch the ID to make sure it's still in working order. I was hoping to get the bottom one off the back of the board, but I can't seem to find it. I have to touch the ID with both sides of the ID, and I have to press the + sides to the back of the screen to come off. I have the same problem with the bottom panel.
I have to remove the contact with the bottom panel, and I have to use the + sides of the board to come off. I have a number of paper clips and adhesive tape I can put on the back of the screen, but no other loose or perfectly working parts.
I am not expecting any problems with the new board, but I am still concerned that it would break in the next few days or months if it ever did come off.
-----
HylianSeven: That's unfortunate. I have the same issue with the bottom panel. The ID was in two pieces. The front and the back. I always find the issue with the ID and have had to use those pieces separately.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Probably getting the same day too.

TheAbsolution: That's horrible. I'm glad you're able to get a working working replacement that was designed from the start to work on the replacement part.

DrewFu: I have a similar problem, but I'm not sure I can fix it.

Ravensmash: I've done this before, but it's just so frustrating.
I know the battery will be a little low for some of the devices that need it, but I know it's only on the screen, but I guess you could buy a case around it and you'd just be able to "touch" the screen with your

~!~Taking a trip to Ireland for the First Time

GK86: Wife and I are taking a week long trip to Ireland for the first time in July. We are staying in the springtime friendly for the first time. We will be staying in the summer weather. Any advice Era, how did you go about your trip?
Thanks in advance.
-----
hwalker84: How did you relax for this long?
-----
GK86: I did a quick one on the beach. I went early morning for some laughs.
-----
Funyarinpa: Where did you go exactly?
I've been twice.
-----
GK86: I was in New Zealand for a few years and it was the first time in my life that I took a day off.
-----
Funyarinpa: My wife was visiting me in New Zealand for 4 months, it was also the first time in our lives that we took a day off.
Honestly, cool to have vacationed in the middle of the Pacific all summer.
-----
Rory: I’m in my early 30s so I’m pretty used to travelling. We’re going with a friend for our first Christmas, and we’re going to travel a few times a year.
But we have TON of experiences to keep us sharp, so I’m excited to keep going.
-----
Hokahey: I'm in my early 40s so I'm used to travelling. We've been to Hawaii and the Bahamas 9 times, but we haven't been to Texas yet. I've also heard good things about the New Zealand Astronomy Society.
-----
GK86: We are both on a flight and traveling alone. We went to a couple of cities that we felt were interesting to learn about, but we went to a few different amusement parks and did some research and visited some of the more laid back beaches. It's not a bad place to work as a car or bus person, but those trips are usually just to get you excited for going somewhere else.

xbhaskarx: Trump’s National Crime Victim Fund Is An Act Of Hateful Scumbag
The New York Times is publishing an article about President Trump’s conviction in federal court of raping a woman — and not only of being a national hero, but a national icon. 
NYT's investigative reporter Bob Woodward and New York Times investigative reporter Glenn Thrush are collaborating on the story, reporting this story, in part on the findings of a independent prosecutor who is investigating Trump’s national security adviser.

~!~How do I buy a Smart Speaker?

Mr. Snuffleupagus: I've been thinking of getting one of these to test out in my spare time. The basic idea is a mid sized tower that's shaped like a desk, but with a speaker in the middle.
I tried the base model and the screen is stuck on the bottom of the desk, so I'm not sure if I could fit it on the ceiling, though I don't mind it. It's probably going to be the one I'll be using for my phone, though. 
I've seen people post how smart speakers can be really great, but I'd really like to try something different.

~!~Does Anyone Else Love This "Appreciation Thread"?

TheGamingNewsGuy: For those that do.... This is a thread of all things "not related to anime". Personally i am not a huge fan of Appreciation Threads, i just find them overly cringeworthy. The thing that is most noticeable is the quotes are not in the proper context of the quote itself as they are basically just a poorly made short novella. So I am curious on others thoughts as well do you enjoy or would love a true appreciation thread?
-----
Sir Guts: My favorite novella. I like a lot of it but I don’t see it being as well written as “The Sisters Brothers”
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah, I'm usually one of those
-----
Dekuman: I just do not understand why these novella's should have a formal title thread.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes and novella thread can be a good thing
-----
nsilvias: it's like a really heavy favorite that was written in the context of having a message that is easy to understand and has a few of its own merits. 
but its not easy to understand. 
it's like a novella
-----
Maya Fey: No, I don't think it should be called "appreciation thread."
-----
Kodros: My mom loves these. I don't think it should be called "fan service thread" either.

There's a lot of horrible garbage in almost every movie I watched, from T'Challa's ukemi being sentient hair to the final fight with the Human Queen.
What are some examples of movies that are objectively offensive?

GinoFelino: It's not offensive to me, but it's offensive to me and the subject matter is disgustingly offensive to the target audience.

~!~The Guardian: The abuse and discrimination of the second wave of Brexit

Lonely1: Source
I think there is already a thread on this, but please feel free to lock if this has already been discussed.
So, I've just read the second wave of Brexit. The first wave of the EU referendum was a massive clusterfuck for the working class, for more than a decade, and now it looks like we have the same issues shaping the future of the working class as well.
The economy is looking very uncertain, and the third wave of Brexit will be the worst affected, followed soon by the chaos and uncertainty. The big issue is the role of the government. The government is a danger to the future of the country, the working class, and the working class can't deal with a 'second' referendum, they need to win another referendum. This second referendum should be the reason the second referendum is going to be happening and the cause of the future of the country.
I'm not going to give any views on UK Politics, but I think what Sterling Post is saying is backed up by the evidence, the facts. We have got to see what the government can do to stop Brexit if they want to.
-----
Platy: It is not a problem if a party is a clear majority in a parliament but it is hard to have a government that is not beholden to a right wing party.
And again there is no point in debating because that is what the 'left' wants, that is the 'working class' that the right wants.
Like SterlingPost said, there is no point in debating politics, that is not what the government wants.
-----
danm999: I’ll say, again, that the most important thing is the people’s future. The country is not ready for another referendum. The people don’t want to get pushed into it because they are afraid of being dragged into it.
Brexit is not just about Leave - it’s about Brexit.
-----
Richter1887: Really?
The Brexit thing is the reason why Labour (who lost seats to Tories) are in the parliament right now.
The Government is caved into the people's will, so they can make decisions about who lives and works in the UK.

Dook's Revenge: He's a dick.

~!~The Doctor is a Horrible Person

Bobo Dakes: I've been watching The Mick, and I'm starting to get a little annoyed that this show is just not fun to watch.
I swear, a lot of the humor is just bad. It's a science fiction show, but the characters are just so very annoying. It's like they're trying too hard with things, like they're trying to help someone, but then they just shrug and they become another victim of the show's bad writing. They are just miserable. But I'm so glad that I watched it. 
I'll admit that I sort of dug it. I think the show was pretty funny, but I also found the writing very bad. 
It's a shame that we're not seeing more shows like this lately.
-----
Htown: It's not the first time Doctor Who has done a story like this, I guess it's just that there are still a lot of generic soap operas out there.
So, I'm upset that this show isn't just bad, it's bad.
-----
John Rabbit: There have been a couple of stories I think that have been pretty funny as well. The Doctor and Siri aren't the only bad characters, they're just a few of them.
-----
vypek: I remember watching a Doctor Who episode where the doctor is really a dick and Siri was the bad one. I think it was a few episodes before it became a common story in Doctor Who. Maybe after a certain point?
-----
Pikachu: I was under the impression there was a lot of problems with the show. People were always mad that it was the first time the Doctor and Doctor Who had been married. And I thought it was a really bad idea to make it a thing like it should have been.
The show didn't get any acclaim, so maybe people just didn't want it to be.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I remember listening to a podcast that had a woman describing all the problems the show faced and it was just an artistic decision to get through with a few episodes.
It's not a show for everybody, but I was always slightly annoyed by the show.
And no, I didn't mean the characters. I'm not too into the show because I don't expect it to be anything like the recent movies that don't have good stories, but I do have a

~!~Chrome is the most broken cryptocurrency out there

jcs: I just got an email from Adobe that comes with a coupon for $0.01 off. No confirmation, and the email came from someone else.
Whoa, chrome has been taken over by cryptos. Can't say I've ever seen a $0.01 off coupon. I'm not even sure if that's the case for chrome.
Seems like Chrome is in the midst of a cryptocurrency craze. I know there are people with stupid-ass ciphers on reddit who've been doing this for ages, but now I'm not sure which are the ciphers.

~!~Michael Jackson’s Death Caused By Woman Who Made A Pornographic Fake Number And It Won't Happear

malyse: Michael Jackson’s death has caused the maker of the fake number to suffer, a court document reveals.
A pornographic number was created and is circulating on social media in hopes of convincing people to get a fake number to find out their real number.
Someone created a fake number using the number Jackson’s real name, and the number was fake but the number was found to be credible enough to pass as a fake number.
Since then the number has been trickling down to society, taking the form of Twitter numbers and Facebook numbers.
The number is a real number so it follows the conventions of how it is written and is a real number so it doesn’t have the contours of “Honey I love u” like a real number.
And of course the number is still a fake number.
This is happening to so many people, it’s hard to feel comfortable with it.
-----
Bronx-Man: This is stupid and I hope it doesn’t pass, but I feel like stuff like this is going to draw out those type of people.
-----
Slayven: Sounds like a fun time to build a fake online account for
-----
Coyote Starrk: Such a strange thing to have such a horrible number.
-----
Blackpuppy: I mean, fuck that, why do we have so much anger towards fake numbers?
-----
cameron: What the fuck was that number?
-----
Shugga: This is fucked up.
-----
Dyle: This is fucked up... I mean, it's a hard number to come up with and the number's real, so it's not even funny, it's probably just a coincidence. I don't think anyone should have to live in a world where someone's number is the real number when it is very hard to come up with a fake number when it's probably a repeat number.

WrenchNinja: I mean this is fucked up.

The Kree: That's fucking hilarious.

Demacabre: I guess the last film I watched before the end of it was the end of its original run.
I watched the majority of it from the start of George Clooney's run, until release, when David Alanasey left the project. I only remember the four leads, and I think I watched Star Wars Episode III once.
-----
May: 3 of them

The Almighty Tria: I don't remember 3, but I did watch The Simpsons once.
I am not sure how I can top the last 4 that are The Phantom Menace and The Pacific, as I think those are close to the same thing.

I remember when I was a kid I loved The Discovery of Witches and I love that song.
What's your favourite song from any media/genre that you love?

ElectricBlanketFire: I'm a big Star Wars fan and I think the original Blade Runner music is my uncles favorite thing ever.

I wonder if they will use the existing iTunes library of shows.
-----
Slayven: That is a pipe dream, I love my iTunes, bought it free 3 years ago, and it is awesome. I don't know how things transfer but if they were to do it, it would be amazing
-----
TheDutchSlayer: Nah, I love iTunes and I love my X.

TheDutchSlayer: Does anyone know how to watch shows on itunes?
-----
BAD: There are a couple of live tv shows on there, but they’re pretty basic IMO
-----
TheDutchSlayer: Yes, I just saw a report that they are developing a live TV service.
It makes sense since it's not like the iTunes library that is on iTunes.

I guess that's why I guess a big part of it's all about streaming.

~!~How do you deal with procrastination?

Yinyangfooey: My work has me through a 3 month project, most of it is me working on it while thinking about what I want to do with the day to day, meanwhile I'm procrastinating on everything else.
I'm not too picky at all, I usually end up just putting in a little bit every other day. I was just mentioning before that I'm really really picky at the moment, I just don't have any idea what I'm doing. I have a lot of plans for the future, I planned a lot of things back in the day, but I just can't seem to find a way to work on the most important things ever. I also forget what I'm working on or find ways to avoid procrastinating on everything. I just don't have the energy to do it all if it's important.
How do you deal with it?
-----
ZOONAMI: I don't really have a solution for you, really. Get a hobby/interest in writing.
-----
NSA: I tend to procrastinate more than I should, but I find it really hard to get going because I usually have a decent amount of time left in the day and I'm really picky about what I do today. I try to plan tomorrow instead of tomorrow, but I'm always gonna be having a really bad day or a really bad day and it's hard for me to focus on that stuff.

~!~"Everything is..." - Benicio Del Toro, Woody Allen, Woody Allen

Wulfric: For those who don't know, Benicio Del Toro is the current (and longest) Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature (and is nominated for an Academy Award for an Independent British title) in the US, and also has an Academy Award for Best Picture in the English language.
He also made a film (which is still not as good as it deserves) about his experiences growing up in a household with a severe asthma condition called Tremors.
He also made a film about his experiences living with severe anxiety disorder called The Royal Tenenbaums, about his experiences with his wife and children at the age of 12.
He also made three other films (in hopes that his films would help the "British" generation of people to start growing up, but they didn't go well), although they were two of his only wins.
At the time I think most recognitions for him were from films like "The Wizard", "The Lady Macbeth", or "The Sinner".
This is not like a small part of his life, but I think Del Toro's films are much more impact and award worthy.
-----
J.R. Ewing: I don't know if Oscar is actually considered Oscar worthy but it's my favorite and most awarded independent film of all time.

~!~Why do so many people can't find their souls?

TearablePuns: I know it sounds like a random meme but I felt this need to explain to others at work: Why do so many people can't find their souls (and it's not even a meme in the first place, just a reminder to the world).
I'm not talking about getting back together with someone or something, I'm talking about finding someone who can. I don't know what to do. I've had to look for years before I finally came to the realization I just can't. I've had to look for months after I finally found someone I really want to fall in love with. I've had to find someone in the last month or so, I've had to share my love with someone I really want to fall in love with.
I know I'm not the most intelligent person in this world, I just can't. I have an ungodly tolerance for irrational urges. If someone wants to believe that I'm not them, I just won't do it.
I know I've had suicidal ideations before, and it's been nothing serious. But it's not the first time I've had to go through something similar. It just isn't the first time.
I'm not talking about suicide, I'm talking about finding someone to fall in love with. I'm not talking about finding someone to fall in love with. I'm not talking about finding someone to fall in love with.
I'm not talking about getting someone to cut ties with someone, I'm not talking about finding someone to fall in love with.
I'm not talking about finding someone to spend eternity in love with.
I'm not talking about finding a partner, I'm talking about finding someone to spend eternity in love with.
I'm not talking about finding a partner, I'm talking about finding someone to be in love with.
I'm not sure what to do.

Brock Reiher: I'm not sure what it is about the world that makes people incapable of experiencing someone else's pain, but love and relationships are for the person with a lot of the same feelings that the person in pain feels. There's no reason to be in love with someone when the pain you're experiencing isn't identical to the pain you're experiencing.

I like the other X-Men too but I think I'm a little hate Hulk. I've been reading recently and I'm reading that the new X-Men could be cool if they keep up the quality.
What are the best additions to the MCU?

UnpopularBlargh: The Breakfast Club (Season 1). I think it's the best season of the MCU since Thor and Daredevil.

Lackless: I think this is what I would want from the country. I don't want to have to deal with the same creeping shit every day I've had to deal with because I'm a minority in the US. This is just not what I want.
-----
Kukulcan: I don't think you understand the context of the current political climate.
The US is really going down the road of trying to do something here, but I don't know what I would.
-----
DrForester: I think if this is something I don't want, then let's just move on.

~!~Gary Whitta joins cast of Netflix anime series

signal: Variety
-----
sn00zer: He's been cool as hell in the past.
-----
HStallion: I'd be interested if I was the main character who was fed milk and got a job dancing around town.
-----
Kewlmyc: I'm not sure Whitta is the right fit for the job but he has been pretty great in the past.
-----
HStallion: He's too young and too quiet for the role.
-----
Daitokuji: I think he's the right guy.
-----
HStallion: He was always the sarcastic side character in the past. Now he's a pretty good backup character in the present.
-----
signal: He's actually been doing voices for the last decade in Japan and they might be doing a new live action series.
-----
Choppasmith: I'd be interested if he's the goofy side character. I'd rather have someone who can act than make an awful anime.

chadskin: Short's hearing was amazing.

Coyote Starrk: I am so fucking sick of this administration. 
Fuck right off.
-----
Jay Mcsaros: How does this guy still have a job? 
Who the hell still runs a federal government? 
Man the whole concept of running a federal government is fucking stupid.
-----
Shard Shinjuku: Short's job is to try to give credibility to Trump's nutjobs.
-----
Jbourne: Short's been as worthless as the guy who ran the Obama White House, so I'm not surprised that he's going to lose his job anyway.
-----
Strike: I'm going to be the judge of Trump's future, so I'm not surprised.

~!~Hollywood Reporter: Avengers Infinity War will have a date in December and is rumored to have a $60 million budget

BDS: This is one of the bigger stories of December, but for those who have been paying close attention, December is a big month for Hollywood. Avengers: Infinity War premieres in its cinemas in theatres, and the first film is set for $60 million.
Avengers: Infinity War is apparently going to have a much more substantial budget this time around, and will probably dwarf the $60 million budget Avengers previously had.
The film has yet to be officially announced, but THR reports that there are "multiple sources telling Jeff Kinney that the $60 million budget estimate will dwarf the $60 million budget for Avengers 4."
And according to the Hollywood Reporter, this is likely the earliest in the film's history that the film's budget will increase this year.
The $60 million budget for Marvel's 4K HDR-only film for this film is going to make it extra tempting to see it in theaters.
-----
Slayven: Damn tiny fuckers are going to be the ones annihilated
-----
Cipherr: At this rate I will be pro-wayne the scene by an hour.
-----
Wollan: So is there really a problem with the digital copy of Avengers 4?
-----
LionPride: Hopefully they make it
-----
Kuro: Imagine that they have double the budget for a film that isn't even mid tier Marvel
-----
Slayven: Or the entire movie
-----
jett: I think this was reported a few weeks ago, but the article is now light on details.
-----

Slayven: Sony still has the upper hand

-----
Coyote Starrk: I mean what the fuck is he black tho!!!
-----
stew: Fuck the NRA.
-----
Kuma Bear: I'm not trying to be racist but I am VERY proud of my boy who was gifted to me by a great father.
This man is a Trump supporter.
This man is also proud that he is a white nationalist.
Just to note that he is also a white nationalist, the words "Trump supporter" were originally given to a black kid as a token of acknowledgement.
-----
The Kree: If you are a white nationalist, you are a white nationalist.

Kyougar: The actual @ person in the quote is a white nationalist!
Good on this kid. Good on this kid for speaking up.

~!~The first 3 Tomatoes from Green Acres show were...

RatskyWatsky: I'm not sure what it's called now, but I had a party at a nearby theater and they made a show of it. 
A couple of weeks later I saw a trailer for a tv series called Tomato Centa, and got to taste test out their Centa series. I've since watched all of it, plus it has a halfway episode. They had a pretty good time making some of the best foods 'bout this shit:
They've been putting out some of their best stuff, like this guy who is a vampire, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a vampire, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, and this guy who is a zombie, you know what I mean.
It's an amazing show, but I'm not sure what the word 'zombie' means.
-----
cj_iwakura: I think it's called something like "Zombie Bros.".
-----
RatskyWatsky: That small piece of shit is clearly defined by the visuals
-----
BringBackSonics: I liked it.
-----
Mushroomer25: It is fun looking back at the show. I've actually not watched the last three episodes, though.
-----
BringBackSonics: Nah, it's a comedy set in a zombie apocalypse, which is when a guy with a Monster Monster and a house, and a Monster Monster, and a Monster Monster, and it all comes together and becomes Avast. Looks like a good show, though.
-----
Hero_of_the_Day: I don't blame Tom. He's a good writer, and it was a great show. I can't imagine how a lot of people lost their minds watching it.
-----
Slime: I liked it, and am a big fan of all things Tomatoes.
-----
RatskyWatsky: This is an old thread I didn't get to do.

Bor Gullet: The most famous film in the history of the underworld, "The Horror at the Mountain" (1954) is also the classic tale that follows up on the famous tale that follows the protagonist's attempts to conquer the mountain until he gets to the peak. It also has a strong follow to the plot of a sequel in 2017. The sequel is in a very different style, focusing on the protagonist's journey to the mountain to get out of the shadow of Mt. Carmona (the main story).

jwk94: Been on the opposite sex. Late 20s, mid 30s, and have never been in pain. I’ve been sober for a few months now and am in a very good place.
I’ve never been on the drugs and have taken whatever the other guy I dates takes for a month or so.

~!~Stephon Clark (SNL) has a ‘I’m a broken record’ view of Trump’s America

BAD: Stephon Clark on the show “SNL” had a really good interview with “The Greatest Showman” Jeffery Tambor:
On the “I’m a broken record” quote from Trump:
“I said I was a broke man and I was a broken record to the point where I thought I was a broken record,” Trump
On the “I’m a broke man” quote from Pelosi:
“I was not, because there was no mechanism in Congress to prevent it,” she told Anderson Cooper. “It was the Republican Congress.”
On the “I have the heart of someone today, with a heart of [something], and I’m not even a Republican” quote:
“We have the heart of [something] … that is a Christian president, and I’m the one that has a big heart, and we have the heart of a Christian president.”
On the “I'm a broke man” quote:
“I don’t understand why Congress would think I’m an illegitimate president.”
[...]
[Trump] is the president we're dealing with.
And yeah, that's the deal with Trump.
-----
DrROBschiz: I love when they do things the right way and leave the room with their own thoughts

Serene: I agree with that. I grew up in the 80’s I’d have work to change anything.
-----
Super Corpse Soldier: Yes, I agree with that sentiment.

Chrno: no

Jombie: Depends on the situation, she's no fucking lawyer.

Shadowrun: It's not illegal to lie, I don't think that's how it works, and it's the law.

~!~What's the best way to watch Dragon Ball Super without having to watch the original?

MasterVampire: I've been watching Dragon Ball Super for the last two years and I've only seen the anime. I don't really watch it that well outside of youtube and GoT. I watched the original movie and I don't think I want to watch the reruns of the original series. 
What's the best way to watch Dragon Ball Super without having to watch the original?
-----
foxuzamaki: I think most anime on netflix has the anime episodes.
If someone wants to watch the original, I think it's cool to do this, even if you don't have to watch the original.
-----
VDenter: I mean the original anime is the only part of the series worth watching. The only thing it lacks is the new animated vids though.
-----
Duane: The original anime is very good in its original glory.
-----
Man God: They're not remakes. They're remasters. The original is a remake.
-----
Krejlooc: I don't think you can watch dubs of Dragon Ball movies legally anywhere near as long as anime. I think the Japanese legal market is crazy.
-----
Krejlooc: I'd say the original anime is worth watching for the remasters of the movies, the original is not far from the quality wise.
-----
Krejlooc: I think the original anime is worth watching with the remasters. It's an original adventure movie. The remake is the most detailed one I've seen.
-----
Reyes: The original anime is worth watching, it's animated and it has great animation.
-----
Krejlooc: The remaster on the Blu-ray version is really good.

Trodimus: I just know how to look at a box office. I can't believe it is being made by a bunch of people who are just bored.
-----

theres like 4 in the top 20 and im not sure how i feel about that

~!~Skynet is acquiring DSLR camera platform for $199

Mashing: Via 
Requires:
10 year old DSLR
300 USD
1000 USD minimum
1000 USD minimum in warranty
I can't tell if it's an overblown concern or not, as SKYNet will take a huge hit if you don't get the minimum.
-----
Dingens: If I were AT&T I would switch to this because DSLRs are the way to go, I don't see how you can get decent quality from them.
-----
Ginta: If you have to ask this to be considered a SKYNet buy, then it's a no brainer.
-----
Allforce: I'm pretty okay with this. DSLRs are the way to go in any scenario. I will say it's a nice deal for a quick buck.
-----
turbobrick: I'd get a second hand SKYNet if I could, but that's probably as close to an "afford" as SKI's cameras are.
-----
snacknuts: I have a DSLR, the second hand SKYNet makes zero sense to me. It's not even top tier. There's just no bellsome, minimal software.

~!~What's the best storage solution for MacOS?

signal: I'm getting a bit of a head start on this one. My Macbook Pro is going to be a little broken and I'd like a really heavy single-disk backup solution. The only one I'm open to is a microSD card reader but I'm not sure that's the best.
What's the best solution for MacOS? I'm looking at a TB stick of wireless one stick with a 2 TB HDD and a 64 TB flash drive. If anyone has suggestions, I'd like to know a little about how to best use them.
-----
Fliesen: I'd say a USB C stick that has a USB-C battery should work.
Otherwise, a USB-C cord is the way to go.
-----
Slayven: USB C hangers are the solution
-----
jcs: I've used USB Hides for a few years now, and it's been great. I use them for my USB-C mouse and keyboard, and have been delighted when they came out.
-----
signal: I guess TBs sticks are the way to go since you're talking about backup.
TBs is great for:
-Power management
-Security
-Internet access
-Era detection and reporting
-All that depends on your needs. 
My overall experience with TBs is they're fantastic, and the battery life is fantastic. I've used USB-C sticks for a few years and they've never been a problem.
-----
fluffydelusions: USB C hanger works but a USB-C cord might not work for you.
-----
signal: What's the last memory you bought from a company and put TB's flash drive/storage in? Or something along those lines.
-----
Fliesen: I've used USB Rest Drives for a few years now. USB Rest Drives suck, but they're hands down the best solution.
-----
Slayven: I mean TBs do suck, but TBs are the best way to backup a computer I've found.
-----
fluffydelusions: How is the USB Rest Drives for Macus so fast? They seem to last me a week?

~!~"Spin-Off" culture, where do you go?

obin_gam: I just got out of a five day trial on "spin on." It's not a "fun day" but I think it's a really important day in our lives. 
Do you do anything with your time? Where do you stay?
-----
Usyren: Depends. If I don't have any "fun" in it I'll just go home and relax. If I have a nice relaxing time while eating or using my phone I'll usually just stay in my room/office.
Otherwise, usually a movie or something.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I work at a movie theater.
I usually run around my room for a few minutes, sitting on my bed, and humming some tunes. Sounds normal, makes me sad, but it's usually a pretty normal feeling to wake up and look at the TV/blinking monitor.
-----
Sir Guts: Me, I cook most of the time.
-----
Morrigan: "Spin-Off" or "I'm going to have my fun day"
If I don't have anything to do in fun days, I'll do something else.
Otherwise, no.
-----
Anthony Hopkins: I watch sports.
Otherwise its fun.
-----
GitarooMan: I don't work every day.
-----
Fulminator: I play games.
Also, no.
-----
Dai101: I play videogames all the time.

Jindrax: I play videogames all the time.

~!~I'm having a hard time finding a good job in the US

Vaelic: Im having a hard time finding a good job in the US. I have a kid, and I'm working to upgrade my career. But I don't really see myself doing much if getting a job here would be a good idea. I've been working in the public sector for about 2 years now and I think I'm a solid fit and would do well for the money. I'm not sure if I'll move to another state or city or not. I know it's not all roses in Philadelphia here in Ohio or anywhere in the US, but I don't see anyone remotely good in any industry here. I'm also enrolled in a public school, and I've been told I can get a good pay grade and a B average. I'm not sure if I'm going to spend my free time in the public sector or in a private sector job here in the US. What should I look for?
-----
Aztechnology: I think it's better to just sit back and let your employer figure that out.
-----
LookAtMeGo: Find a job and let your employer figure it out.
-----
BAD: Try to find work experience that pays
Do a masters and get a C average.
Do a B average.
Do a B- or even Master’s.
Do a D.
Do a B- or nothing
Budget
The key will be
Good communication with colleagues and employers.
Being able to discuss what’s happening around you with your employer and your boss.
Getting a job first and having the other people involved in managing to get your side of things.
What kind of job do you want?
What’s your budget?
What are your expectations?
Do you have any experience working in a certain industry that would be good?
-----
Vaelic: Not to mention the fact that my kid is going to be working towards a B average.
-----
BAD: I’m working on my Master’s, but I’m not sure if I would be able to get a job in the public sector
-----
LookAtMeGo: I guess I should be thankful I have a job with a private sector. I'm in the public sector but I don't know.
-----
vatstep: Get a good grade

~!~Sony Xperia XZ1 Announced (Plus 3.4%)

ZattMurdock: For those who don't know about this phone, this is a Sony phone that's coming out this year, all the major Sony hardware manufacturers are releasing it with the EXACTLY the same specs as this phone:
Screen (Pixels as high as 16, but the display has a bigger, smoother, more chameleon looking pixel than this).
Aspect Ratio of 21:9
Number of Cameras (so 19MP, with 19 total)
Aspect Ratio of 21:10
Number of Cameras (so 12MP, with 18 total)
Aspect Ratio of 21:10
Picture size (174ppi)
Price (Unknown at the moment)
$1499 (US)
Seems like the specs are exactly the same as this phone, and this is a great phone, it looks off the top of my head and I can't believe they're releasing this "new" phone like this.
-----
Gray Matter: Live with this one, it'll be a fun day.
-----
ZattMurdock: This is what theres talking about. I'm down for it since I'm always getting excited for new stuff.
-----
NinjaScooter: The XZ2 is the real deal.
-----
GK86: Looks like a Sony with a headphone jack if that helps you get the real deal.
-----
ZattMurdock: Also, just saw that Sony's new phone doesn't support 2nd view. So...
I'll have to look into that.
-----
ZattMurdock: I believe this is the XZ2. I've been eyeing XZ1's (2.7), but it's been a while since I got tired of the S8's.
-----
ZattMurdock: It is that, but I didn't know this phone was coming out. It's also been a while since I last used it.
-----
Fright Zone: I need this phone, but I don’t want to be disappointed by it.
-----
ZattMurdock: I have been using the XZ2 for a while now, and I plan on getting one of the few new phones I can manage on my phone, the S8 would be great as I don’t want

~!~Live The Wiz - Star Wars (Netflix)

Wag: I just watched this movie for the first time in years. So good. Not digging the runtime or the humour, but the winky faces and winky faces stuff is just alright. I also really enjoyed the bit about the Princess Leia scene.
-----
Wag: It's not bad, not bad by any means.
-----
TaleSpun: Boring as ever. Couldn’t watch it in a good way, but it’s not bad. I remember I saw it in college and the movie sucked.
-----
Rinse Bassfunk: I was actually going to make a thread about it lol
-----
Rogue Blue: Huh, looks like I’m going to have to check it out.
-----
oatmeal: I watched it a couple days ago but didn’t finish the last act. The movie is way too over the top for me for it's own good.
-----
Wag: I think the Hansi/Bitter Werther stuff is fun. The way they break the Third Law is neat.
-----
ArgyleReptile: I thought it was pretty alright. I liked the Princess Leia stuff, though I found it a little too melodramatic.
-----
Wag: I watched it recently and the humour was bad. It's not as bad as it could be.
-----
Terrajig: I had the same experience with it. I thought the last act was OK, but nothing really on par with the stuff the director is making now.

~!~What are some good Amazon reviews for A24?

Fuhgeddit: I'm looking to buy some albums right now and I'm looking for:
1. The Magicians - Is this a good album?
2. The Ones We're Going Back to? - It sounds OK but is the song going to be a drill?
3. To the Lighthouse - Not my thing. I'm not into the song and I don't like the guitar on this.
4. The Blind Lucidity - What is this?
5. The Pacific - What is this?
6. The Broken Blade - It's a nice song but I don't like the vocalist's voice.
7. The Lighthouse - Not my thing. The song is not bad and I like the song but I just need to find some decent songs that are good.
8. Still Walking - It's a song that's not in the running for my spot on album of the year, but I feel like there's a lot of good music that does a little better job at creating a certain kind of feel.
9. Me, myself, I, etc.
It's a really good year for music, but I've always been a fan of current year's tracks. I can't recommend this enough. I'm still going to the gym, but I know that it'll be mostly from the current year.
What are some real good albums that are on the same level as yours? What songs do you like?

shnurgleton: no

Fuhgeddit: I'm not even sure I like any of them. I like The Monkees' stuff, though.

Tethered Penguin: In Japan there is a special section for good restaurants.

Fliesen: How do you 'ghost' in Japan, then?
-----
Fliesen: Well, looking at pictures of Biyomon, it's like he's in a movie, but a restaurant.
But, it's not like this in Japan, so I don't know if we have a 'ghost' ghost in America.
-----
signal: Oh I'd thought this was about the restaurant. But it's just a photo of Biyomon, not a photo of Biyomon.
-----
Zhukov: I used to go to this restaurant once a week. The owner died at the age of 33 and was the only person I could find to handle it for a long time.
And I don't want the word 'ghost' to devalue the event it happened.

American Eskimo: "A total of eight people are in critical condition in a hospital, according to authorities. Jeanine Bertrand, 25, a passenger on a flight from Reading, London, with her father, uncle and cousin, who has a history of mental health problems, was seized and arrested Sunday night. Bertrand is now wanted for failing to stop his truck from ridding himself of the gun. "

~!~Is Your Car The Best One-Sides Personality?

Bobo Dakes: As a new owner of a 2012 Nissan Altima, I'm constantly challenged to which personality I should get. I'm not talking about the "look like an asshole" snarling personality, I'm talking personality that's easy to admit you have a lot of good stuff to say and enjoy, but they just don't match. So, first off I'd like to say that I have to say that I'm a personality on this board. I'm more of a outspoken person overall, but I'm also fairly upfront about it. I don't care if it's not my favorite or favorite one, I'll disagree -- I do love the car.
I'm not looking for someone to argue against me about something I really don't like about it. In fact, I like it a lot more than the Altima, but I'd prefer if it was more approachable. I've never owned a car myself, but it seems like it's getting more and more popular and I'd like to keep it in the same boat.
I'm always open to suggestions and opinions and the only one that's been on here for at least a year and half has been the Altima. I'm not really into the Altima's overly formal or formal-looking cars, but I've been eyeing the Altima for months. I'm not a fan of the uninspired look of most Altima's I seem to have. It definitely looks nicer. I'm not a fan of the overly formal look of 2017 Mazda CX-5s either, mind you.
I'm interested in hearing opinions from people who own at least one of these. I'm not looking for a car to be cheap or anyone to argue me out of having to argue with me, but I do want to experience the car. I just want to know, is it worth it to me? Should I just get a 2010 Altima or should I go for a 2012 Altima? What have been your experiences with these personality types?
-----
Kraken3dfx: I'd say if you can't handle the snarkiness and insults, it's time to just buy a nicer car. It's better to sit down and gas up.
-----
Tence: 2012 Altima is gorgeous but be warned that it’s a bit late for that. I’m not sure what the

~!~Should women be able to be paid for their attractiveness?

Memento: I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately and I’m curious as to what Era thinks.
I don’t mean to derail the main question but I just want to say to Era: Women are beautiful and deserve to be paid for their beauty. Why wouldn’t they?
If you want more info what I’m looking for here:
Are men’s beauty standards higher than women’s? If so what do they have to offer?
The most common example I see is a woman’s body being more beautiful to men than the average man.
-----
JCHandsom: I think you can argue facial beauty is more of a social construct than anything else, but I don't think facial beauty is more indicative of one's physical or mental health.
-----
takriel: Pretty much this.
-----
shnurgleton: Yes, and it's been getting better for women and productivity and overall well-being in general
-----
Buzzman: As a man, I can't imagine a case where I'd be so naturally attractive to a woman.
-----
Kasai: Yeah, because I've seen more and more attractive women in the past few years. 
But I also think there's a balance between the two, and that's a really fine balance.
-----
Rackham: I think the question should be "are men and women beautiful?"
-----
Biestmann: Yes, I think that's a really fine balance.
-----
hydrophilic attack: I would love to be paid to look good, but i think that would be an unreasonable expectation
-----
i-Lo: I think that's what some would say, but I think it's far more reasonable to want to be paid for my appearance and good traits, not because those qualities are attractive to men or women, but because you can bet your ass man who wants to be paid to look good will be willing to sacrifice appearance for a good life.

His two sons were born out of wedlock. His wife was an illegal alien. His two chins were orphans. They were taken from him, murdered by his own people.
This filled all the bases. I watched it for the first time in my life.

Dishwalla: this is a big deal
-----
Coyote Starrk: Yeah Trump is the one who's the most serious and aggressive in decades. He's been cock-steamed to the point of needing to be a nuclear power plant pilot for the last 2-3 years.
-----
Mimosa97: This is the one thing everyone saying about Trump is he's so serious he's willing to get cocksteamed by the sheer number of enemies he has stoked.

Dishwalla: as a goof Im not sure how the nuke technology is in that scenario actually dealing with the US. the fact that it's not used is not surprising at all.
-----
Mimosa97: Yeah it's weird that they were so open about this.
-----
Coyote Starrk: Pretty much. Trump is willing to give up all that and go straight to doing something else. If Trump ends up being the one to give it to North Korea I think they can do that. If Trump ends up being the one to use it to do something then it'll be a big deal.

If you have read a book or played a video game, why do you not understand what "most" means?

~!~I just watched this dad explaining to me the "cool" of the MCU costumes in the last few minutes

Rivenblade: So, let's see the "cool" of the Disney MCU in the last minute or so.
I'm watching the first Avengers film at home and decided to search for "MCU" and I saw a bunch of references that I don't know if I want to use. (IE: not "Iron man costume," but it's more "Thanos Hulk" or "Black Panther.")
I ended up just being like, "yeah, I know these are cool, but how does it translate to the MCU?" And straight up "there's no need for this right now." And that was enough for me.
So, I guess it's no shock at all that a reference would be awesome, but a dad and I being baffled by MCU's costumes now is weird. What does the MCU stand out to you?
-----
PSqueak: i like the Hulk, but the "cool" ones are probably the ones i don't understand.
-----
MadLaughter: The X-Men. I mean, I can go with the "unusual" (the "unusual" is something like the Cyclops, the Angel, the Doctor), but I don't know the context for the "unusual."
I'm not sure exactly how they're used, but I always thought the "cool" ones were the ones I always see in trailers reusing the "coolness" of the comic in the first place.
-----
Sibersk Esto: The Hulk
-----
BreezyLimbo: the Spiderman
-----
LewieP: Hulk, the Greek god of heralds, warriors, and heralds.
-----
SageShinigami: The Hulk is an interesting hypothetical example. He's not really defined by the costume, but he's usually pretty defined. It's not really surprising he'd be a gruff, self-confident immortal looking thing. His main point is the symbiote is pretty useless and the only one who really cares about him.
-----

KtotheRoc: I like the Hulk. It's not exactly as edgy, but it's fun to me. The Hulk is a great, fun character to watch explain in a goofy way.

Cordy: Hulk

~!~Is it possible to get more rights from the original TV series (TNG, DS, etc)?

Liquid Plejades: I'm looking to broaden my view on TV series. I guess I'm interested in all the different rights from the original series and more.
I'm just looking for some quotes to further educate myself on the different rights that are out there.
-----
RDreamer: I think there are a couple of things you need to consider:
You could potentially get more rights from the original series.
The original series has writers that have had to do a lot of rewrites.
You could get more rights because a lot of the writers are better at using original ideas (which is something that is possible, but not a guarantee)
You need to weigh both possibilities.
-----
M.Bluth: I think you probably want to keep the original series.
The rights are a big factor, but it can also lead to an adaptation of a story that was originally broadcast in syndic and then pulled in a lot of commercial as well as cable networks want to air it.
-----
BDS: You're looking for a show that is produced by a production company? If you want to go for a spin off of a series, or a spin off of an original story, I would keep with your premise. 
If you want to make the show, sure. There are a bunch that want to do crack, so I think a good route would be to just finish the series. Not sure if that's possible as TV rights are extremely complex and there are a ton of options.
-----
Nappuccino: It depends on how much rights you're willing to give up for some stuff, and depending on how much it's going to benefit them, if that's possible you'd probably just like to see it do well. 
For example, I could see DS9 hitting Netflix at some point, I think it's possible but there's a lot of restrictions on how they can legally distribute it.
-----
Etrian Oddity: I would like to see a Trek-like show based on a Discovery-esque series, but I wouldn't want it to be a series of "I'm not interested in the Picard, let me do this anyway" shows. 
I think it could work. Couldn't imagine why a show would need to be made after the series, and

~!~A look at the history of U.S. Presidents

BossAttack: I've been making a Resetera.com account for the last several years and have been a loyal American for many years. But this last year I made an effort to learn more about the life of our current President. It was a fascinating read.
There's a lot more to the article in this thread, but here's the first part:
I haven't written a ton of articles in the past, and this kind of breaking news thread is a good place to read about our current Presidents. I think it's a good place to start if you want to get started on the life of our current President.
But here's a more fundamental question:
How is this news?
Today, a small fire burned through the entire nation and we were called upon to mobilize our counter-terrorism capabilities. This was in Illinois, an area that’s about to be majority Hispanic, blue state. The population is minuscule when it comes to being accustomed to voting, but Trump’s rhetoric and policies have caused so much destruction that community cohesion is declining.
Now, we have a Democratic House and Senate, but what happens here is that the Democrats and the people in the DSA are going to get nearly all the votes in the election, which means they lose seats that would be possible if they spent the time to map out all the votes that the people of the DSA are going to get. That is not a fair play.
So, is this the end of this? Or is it a sign of our national decline? Or are there other ways to end our decline?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Not really.
-----
Steel: The end of an era.
-----
TheFireman: It's just a lie from them and their voters, and I'm not going to say they don't have a point to make or talk about anything, but it's just an extension of that false narrative that they've fucked up multiple times before.
-----
Spaced Harrier: Let me guess, the Democrats are actually a collection of fascists and going to put up with it.

~!~LTTP: The Last Kingdom

nando: (ends at the OP)
I just finished it and holy hell it's cool. I don't know if I have seen anything like this before. I've seen the king before but that was completely different and I didn't expect it to be this good.
I adored the actual novel way back in the day but man it's over the top and garbo.
I had no idea who Arthas was until the last ten years or so but the last book basically made me wonder what the hell they were thinking when they added the word 'narrina' to the book title.
I had no idea who Arthas was before the last few years and I was like 'wtf?!?'
Here's the thing though: this is the second book I've read that has been translated from an old french paper back in 2017. This is also the official translation that has made the thread lol.
The last book has a lot of crazy shit in it. Arthas is a druggie who is basically a dogging God, he's a sex cultist and he has a son with the power of a god. This book is so fucked up that I took it in the notes that it's literally fucking disturbing.
The last book has the most insane shit I've ever seen in a story. The man in man is a whiny monster and a broken man, they're like two characters in a story and it's all projection. This book is like, everything in it is shit and the way that shit works. The way that shit works is so fucked up that it's crazy.
I was also relieved to see that lord knows that the king is a reincarnation of the son of the late king of the realm of the dead. This guy is a lord, he's the head of the realm of the dead and he's reincarnated into the last good dynasty on earth. He's a son called T'Challa and he was the head of the Valar realm. T'Challa was the son of the late king of the realm of the dead and the rightful head of the reccomendation into the good king of the realm of the dead.
Also, everything about this book is just crazy. I mean, just look at this shit:

Widdle Puppy: So basically I've been going to the grocery store to get some food to eat and I see a bagel for $2.40 and it is something I really want to buy but when I go there it's not there yet so I realized I'll be able to buy it for another $2.40. So I decide to go to grab some, but I don't think I'll get much worth eating because I don't really know what I'll get and I want something that will be good for me.
So I want to get some that have cheese and yogurt and some really sour cream and sour cream is what I'm looking for is good. But I can't seem to find a good bagel that is just $2.40 and I don't really know what to even get for my $4.
I've tried a bunch of stuff but this is the only bagel I've tried that is $2.40 and I would like to try others like sour cream, cream cheese, etc. I really want to try cream cheese but I don't know what I'm doing.
So I'd like to know if anyone here has some suggestions or anyone else has some advice on how to get food like this.
-----
Beartruck: I haven't tried out food but I'll turn my attention to the foods that don't make sense in the first place.
-----
inner-G: Sour Cream? I never had a bagel before, but this is might be the closest you can get for $2.40.
-----
Widdle Puppy: I know what you mean bruh. I did not have much to contribute other than mentioning that I'm not trying to get anything for free. Just wanted some suggestions on what I should get.
-----
A Fish Aficionado: I like to eat sour cream and cream cheese.
-----
Hjod: I like a good smoky bready, with or without milk.
-----
Pegasus Actual: Sour Cream and a sugar bagel. Or maybe some sort of eggplant and toast.
-----
Widdle Puppy: I saw a bagel cafe near me. It's a good bag, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price.
-----
SugarNoodles: I have a bagel place

~!~I'm trying to learn how to code. I can't seem to get anything out of it

o k: I'm not sure where to start. I'm always down to try new coding challenges, but I don't know how to start. I bought a cheap tablet a couple months ago and I'm trying to learn a new language, so I'm not sure where to start in trying to learn new things.
I'm not really interested in coding as a profession, but I'm sure I'll get things right. I'm not interested in doing anything illegal, so I don't know where to start.
-----
Sampson: I've never thought about it, but the first few days are brainingless. It's very easy.
-----
Lumination: First day is spent figuring out the basic programming languages you'll need for the next 10+ days. You'll make some good gains, but you'll still be limited by your time.
-----
ZOONAMI: Use the Udemy course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Then just start on CSS and build up your own portfolio and get certified to code in the future.
-----
Cantaim: I'm sorry I just got this out of my system.
You should be able to get started on coding by understanding the concepts of collections and sets and how they work. You'll also be able to get an idea of the "student side" of the business of programming. You'll need to take actual courses on the subject.
-----
Ozgiliath: When I was in highschool I started with Java and then went through C# for a while, eventually I got the basic HTML through some classes I made and then I started coding something simple.
-----
Conkersbadfurday: Maybe learn basic HTML, then learn HTML on the side. Maybe you make good websites for your web application. If you make webapps for the web, there's a good chance you can learn the basics.

====================
~!~Do you have a copy of your spouses names on file?

Squarehard: Just curious, what do you think about this?
This is definitely a thing, but I think it's a lot of fun to share this information with other people in need.
-----
Musubi: I want my copy of my spouse's name. I'm a little hesitant about sharing it because I have to gather my dust here to see them. 
I got a copy of them filed online. We'll see if we can find them.
-----
Vilix: I’ve got a copy of my wife’s name on file. I’ll see what he’s maily.
-----
Rory: Not sure if married or just registered.
Also, I’m going to see my wife on Monday, just registered to move up one street for aartment.
-----
Gifted: As far as I know, when you do this, your spouses are anonymous. I'm not happy with that, but I don't see how this needs to be done.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I'm going to see my wife on Monday. I'm not going to wait.
-----
Mahonay: I’ll see F&M on Sunday.
-----

====================
~!~Why is it so hard to enter a job interview?

Uzuki: I know I'm the only one who doesn't know what I'm looking for. Even though I've had numerous jobs already, I still want an offer. What's the most likely cause of this? My core group of skills are the most valuable, so I want to be able to get them before the interview starts.
I'd be surprised if I could get an interview with any certainty. I think there's no hidden trick to make it more of an interview, some skills are obvious, and others are hard to forego.
It's very hard to get anything at my current job, and it's partially because I've been working there my whole life, I'm very sheltered and very anxious, and I don't know how to process that.
Most of this stuff is easy to learn, and I don't know if I'll gain any skills I wouldn't be able to already learn, but I'm interested in learning more.
-----
Tremagus: Because you never know what the hell you want to do. Hell, I just want a job.
-----
Aurongel: Because most companies will never hire someone for whatever reason. There are just as many stupid reasons why you shouldn't apply if they aren't interested.
-----
Kapryov: Yeesh.
I don't want to be left out, but I do want to apply to a job that I'm sure I'll never even want to do.
-----
MrKlaw: You really think you'll gain anything by applying to a job that isn't really there and never having seen the interview process?
You're probably best off just quitting if you have the time.
-----
Kor of Memory: Because a job candidate will always be the most interesting thing in your application and will always want to apply to that job.
If you apply to jobs they won't reject but they will most likely reject your application.
-----
Brock Reiher: Because it's the only way to get into a good job
-----
Tremagus: I'm not talking about hiring a good job candidate. I'm talking about getting a good job. I'm not saying that it's impossible if you want to get into a good job, I'm saying that applying to a job that's clearly impossible would be the best way.

~!~So I'm watching Berserk season 3...

Ryo Hazuki: So I just finished Season 2 Episode 11 of Berserk and just...I...I don't know what happened. I watched three episodes and just...I don't know what happened. I watched the pilot episode of season 3 and just...I don't know what happened. I watched episode 11 and I just don't know what happened. I watched Berserk season 3 and I just don't know what happened. 
I'm wondering if anyone here on Era was role playing during season 3.

Widdle Puppy: I saw this on Reddit and I was wondering why there are so many videos of it? My Youtube history is full of videos like this but I don't think any of the ones I know of are as well known as Kattinoff's. A lot of his videos are really good and if you like street food, then definitely check that out.

====================
~!~The most annoying thing about the EU is that it doesn't have a full (official) version of the EU.

DosaDaRaja: So, as the title suggests.
The EU will not have any version of the EU after the 2021 elections.
After the 2021 elections the European Parliament has decided to postpone the elections.
The reason for this decision: 
The reason for the delay: 
Latvia is not going to be part of the E.U. unless the E.U. has its own version of the E.U.
First, we need a proper version of the European Union. That is, it needs something like 23% or higher. That is not going to happen unless the parliament (and the Council) agrees (or something) and is willing to work towards it.
Latvia is not going to be part of the E.U.-EU unless the E.U. also has its own version of the European Union, which it will need (and it will not be enough for a single currency union to work).
So, let's take a look at some ways to improve things.
1. Allow more time for latin new people to get used to the new "republic", and more time for the latin-based economy.
2. Allow more time for latin-based new people to get up to speed with the full version of the European Union.
3. Ensure that the E.U. just happens to not have a single parliamentary bill.
Wouldn't that just make the whole matter hilarious?
-----
Mivey: The EU will never let us all live without a functioning democracy. It is too important that we have an integrated democracy.
-----
Birdseye: Allow full Berlusconi in the EU
-----
DosaDaRaja: Thank you.
-----
Mivey: That's precisely what they'll need. A proper European identity.

Birdseye: Would the EU actually be good for the latin economy?

~!~I just moved and I have a new problem that I am not sure how to fix...

M52B28: I just moved back to my parents house. I'd lived at their house for ten years before I got fed up with my old apartment. Then I moved to their place in the middle of nowhere and work has been taxing for my income.
I want to move back but my parents are not paying for rent. They are paying about the same amount for electricity bills as me. My fiancee and I pay for gas and electricity. My fiancee could have saved money from her parents and we could have lived like a good person.
I'm living off savings and paying off the apartment lease to own the property for the next 10 years. I've got a good job, good credit, stable income, and I've never been in a situation to end up homeless. Now that I've moved on to higher income options, I'm having to figure out what to do.
How do I survive if I make less then what I make more now?
-----
Stouffers: Probably more money.
-----
BLEEN: Start saving for a down. That's what my younger brother did, but he's only been saving for a few years now. If you make enough to buy a house when you're done save for a down.
-----
Taco_Human: Start saving for a down. That's why I did that.
-----
Dishwalla: have a down, get a down.
if you can't afford a down, start looking for a by-demand job.
if you can, get out and save a bunch of money to get a down faster.
-----
DrewFu: I actually don't know how to survive with this new situation. My parents got a home inspection recently and they were asking for money.
-----
TronLight: Being homeless is a "new situation" and I don't understand living with roommates.
-----
M52B28: I am paying $900 a month for electricity and water, and they are paying for internet and TV internet just fine.
-----
platocplx: that's what I'm looking for, if i make more then what my parents are paying and if i can afford internet then what my parents are paying is what i'm asking for.

~!~The Art Of The Problem With The Oscars

CoolestSpot: I'm at a turning point.
I feel like we've lost the plot.
We've got the skit at the end of The Circus - the worst competition out there, and it's the worst that I've ever seen.
We've got The Artist's Travesty (ok I know, it's a thing, but I feel like it's kind of a trap).
We've got Ethan Van Sciver (he's fucking amazing), it's Jodie Foster, and she does a creepy-ass piece that's pretty bad.
We've got Kevin Spacey (though I thought he was great)
And there's some old, and I don't know, but I can't help but feel like that's the plot of a bad Comedy show.
And then there's some of the writing myself.
But my favorite piece of the problem is the ending of The Grand Budapest Hotel.

adj_noun: I think the problem is that the people involved in this have a bad opinion of the movie, but that doesn't change the fact that it's objectively bad.

~!~Why do people get so high at the gym?

brainchild: I've noticed this quite a bit in the last few weeks:
I'm doing a run today, and I'm getting high. I'm doing a brisk walk, and I'm doing a brisk walk, and I'm doing a brisk walk. And I also do a very slow press/run today, and I'm doing a very slow press/run.
I don't know what it is about the person that makes them high, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong here. It's a gradual high. It's not high, but I feel like I'm catching a cold. I'm not sure if I'm just high or if I'm simply doing something wrong here. But I'm only a little high because I'm feeling like something is catching up to me. I'm not sure if this is the cause of high, but I don't think it's because I'm tired, or if it's just me.
The good thing is that I don't have to do anything. I have to leave my apartment at 7:30 am, and since I leave around noon, I can sleep until 10:30.
I just don't want to get up and go to sleep, and I don't want to go to sleep, and I don't want to go to sleep. I'm not a bad person. I'm just really bad at accomplishing whatever I set my mind to, and sometimes I just can't stop thinking of the things I can do to get up and go.
Has anyone else got something like this?
-----
brainchild: I don't have any issues with that. The problem is that I just don't have the motivation to do as much cardio. I'm doing it for those 260 hours a week, but it's so hard. I think I'd like to keep it low, or at least, try to focus on that instead of just doing things that negatively.
I guess I have a nickname for this (brainchild) that is harder to change than my actual physical activity.

Mediking: I'm really bad at this.

~!~Panda Protection

Heromanz: This is a topic that I just feel like is necessary because most of us know that the issue is not only about the drugs but also the people using them and the potential for more side effects.
I will start with that product that does this.
This is a generic colour for a pain medication that doesn't actually contain any of the active drugs.
It's called Philips Orange.
I'll start with a few specific ones.
Chlorda Mitalle
I'll start with a picture of a description:
I don't recall the name of the product being described accurately.
Diclofo Spray
I'll end up with a picture of the actual name on the bottle:
I might be a bit sensitive on those sensitive eyes.
Morphin 20
I'll end with the description of the product in there but will try to get some perspective.
Nicotine Eucerin Ximely
According to the ingredients of the product in the packaging, the ingredients for this one and the other ones described as part of the name of the product are the active ingredients.
The actual product as described in the product information is the ingredients:
Pentazol is the active ingredient.
I'm not going to quote the actual ingredients of the product as it's hard to look them up.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I feel your pain.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I feel your pain.
-----
dennett316: I don't recall the ingredients of the product being listed in the packaging or anything, so I'd assume that you're probably right. The ingredients of the ingredients in Dulbeeth was listed as part of the name of the product, and the Dulbeeth Name is a generic name, so it's basically just listed as generic.
-----
Paraside: I don't remember the ingredients of the medication, but the Dulbeeth name is on the package itself.
I also didn't read the thread so I can comment further - but I didn't read the product description in your post.
I think you're right. I just think you're right. I don't recall the name of the product being listed in the packaging and having the Dulbeeth name in it.
