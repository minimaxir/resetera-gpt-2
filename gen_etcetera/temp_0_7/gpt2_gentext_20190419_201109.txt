~!~I'm bored, but I'm not bored, I'm doing something productive

Teh Hamburglar: I just had a little break from work. I usually wake up at 7:30 am and spend the day playing a video game or watching a movie. I then go home and relax. 
But this year I decided to study something, something new, something new for me. I'm doing something:
- Meditation
I'm trying to find a balance between focusing on my work and my personal life.
- Reading
I've decided to read this book because it's about a former military officer who just joined the army to advance in his career. It's about the late 50s, early 60s in the Marines. It was a very very controversial book and I disagreed with the overall thesis, but I decided to go with it. I don't want to write that I don't know the entire story because I want to make people happy and feel better about myself. I just want to get some advice on the best way to combat the aspects of boredom I've had. I just want to give back. Maybe some perspective here.
-----
Rellodex: I mean, it sucks. 
But overall, I’m bored. I don’t get bored.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Sounds like a combination of both. I'm just getting my ducks into a row.
-----
Kazoku_: I'm sorry to hear that. I think the biggest thing that makes boredom so hard for me is just how easily it can make life feel like a chore. It's tough because I'm far from a bad guy and I'm well past the point where I can casually be a good guy or even a bad guy, but it's still a constant cycle. Like, I don't really feel like I have anything to say. I guess it's just the fact that I can't stand to think about something and not feel like I need to say anything anymore. I feel like I'm wasting my time.
-----
chuey: I'm bored, but I'm doing something:
-----
TheBeardedOne: Seems like a combination of both. I'm still trying to unlearn the book, though, which is probably a good thing, even though I've already read the whole thing.

shnurgleton: I like reading fiction, but I don't think

~!~why does the new macbook pro look like a cheap ass piece of junk?

BAD: I'm talking about this piece of junk: the new MBPs look cheap ass as fuck. The minimal black is actually just the dark brown color.
WTF is this thing?
Why does the new MBP look like this piece of shit? Even if I don't care about the color, the new ones are too cheap for my tastes and I'll be replacing them with the same models in the future.
-----
Cocolina: It's just a cheapo version of the current MBP.
-----
Gatti-man: It has a thread quality issue and it’s kinda ugly. I’m not sure that’s the worst thing about it.
-----
BAD: Yeah I don't get it. It looks so creased and hardly any clear difference. I'll admit I used to cringe when I first saw it on the TV
-----
BiggK: I don't know if it's the color, but I think the color is what made the colors change.
-----
Cocolina: It's a cheapo Microsoft/AT&T/MSU exclusive.

Deleted member 9145: Red Sox: A.J. Green, 20 y/o
Raguy Bruno, 20 y/o
Mike Fonsa, 20 y/o
-----
ChrisR: I think the Red Sox's winning record is less like 5-10 years ago. It's 5-3 or 5-12.
I'm a bit biased though since he's been around since the team's inception.
-----
Cocolina: Rangers
-----
TriniTrin: Red Sox
-----
Deleted member 9145: 2 years ago we had ONYA and SOPHIE and now THEY are not what I would call a team.
-----
thediamondage: Yankees
Jose Reyes, 21 y/o
Josh Banks, 21 y/o
Markie Markie Markie Markie Markie Markie, Nick Cephas, 21 y/o
-----
Mediking: I don't know, but I don't really have a favorite record of the three.
-----
B-Dubs: Even though it's a weird team, I still would have a hard time ranking the rangers as the worst team in baseball.
-----
Cordy: Rangers. A team that can't win a goddamn game.

ElectricBlanketFire: I'm confused, but is this a joke?

~!~What are your favorite old movie/art book?

Scarecrow: What are your quintessential "what's your favorite thing in life" lists? Then you can rest your brain on zany old fads that you'd forgotten about or that just stick in your head.
For me, I'm gonna go with The Three Caballeros.
I have a backlog of them all (so an odd number if there isn't one already). I actually started collecting them when I was younger and I'm still going to Palm Sunday with the Rock and a Verve, for instance.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: The Muppets sketches.
-----
leng jai: Love every book.
-----
chandoog: I am not a big fan of Calvin & Hobbes but I'll always have a soft spot for All These Things That You Need Is Romance.
-----
jcs: I'm a sucker for both Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Gnomes.
-----
Keywork: The Three Caballeros is my personal favorite book. It's a masterpiece of an amazing art book. It has a bunch of characters that are just too great for my taste to ignore.
-----
C.Mongler: I had never read any of his work and was always super bored with his other works by now. I'm still waiting on The Three Caballeros.
-----
Mona: I feel like most of my life
but I still read all of Sherlock Holmes

Cocolina: It's a chocolate with cream, not chocolate with cream

Kapryov: No, it's just chocolate covered clams
-----

-----
TheBeardedOne: It's one of those things where I'm always looking forward to the day it's available. I do wish it came with some kind of flavor, though, for a bit of peace.

====================
~!~A woman wanted for trying to fight a man in his home

chirt: I remember when this first popped up on Twitter. She was a pastry chef in a small NYC neighborhood and she was just having some arguments with this man, I think he was trying to show some kind of "respect." 
As far as I know that's not a standard protocol in NYC; if this man was a security guard, or even a janitor in the building the woman wanted to fight back in. And if she was just trying to hurt him, she was clearly trying to show some kind of respect, but I can't say for certain if she was angry or just plain friendly or something. 
If you have any examples of this kind of behavior in your area, I'm sure it's going to be a tough fight going forward.
-----
Cantaim: Damn right this is what I am thinking.
-----
Platy: People will defend their respect no matter the reason 
If you have a few good stories, Threads, etc and people give props to those who go to someones house to fight with them, its a tough fight.
-----
Slayven: People are shitbags.
-----
Betty: Seems like she was friendly enough, I guess it's just a shitty thing to do.
-----
Akira86: People are stupid.
-----
CormoranStrike: This is a terrible situation for sure. It was much more friendly to her when she wanted to fight back in.
-----
RedBlue: It’s fragile honesty than a guarded man that is just trying to show respect to her.
-----
Powdered Egg: Respect to the woman and man who tried to say something she didn’t like at first but eventually realizes she’s being disrespectful.
-----
julian: I’m not going to hold back a little respect for someone who is trying to show you a painting or sculpture, but I’m especially offended by this.

~!~I've been rewatching The VVU movies for the first time since the first movie and they are awesome!

Robiin: So I just watched The VU movies for the first time since I was a kid.
I've been rewatching them since I'm on Hulu and watched the most recent ones, but I haven't been able to really rewatch them since.
The movie seems to be about the UF students and it's in high school. I didn't know that it's a major sin to pretend you aren't a child. They fight a bunch of kids and it's awesome. 
The story is set around the 3rd movie, they're just students back at the school who all have the same problems. But the movie doesn't shy away from that. It's pretty much about the same situation.
The students are fighting the teacher and he's a bunch of bullies.
The teacher has a pretty bad haircut so they take him out.
The students also don't understand what the First Avenger is even saying. But the movie is pretty awesome.
And the actors are all great.
I really liked the first movie but hated the second movie.
-----
Platy: I really like the first one, but the 2nd one was pretty bad and the 3rd was not good
-----
Ocarina_117: I've seen them since I was a kid a couple of times and I've seen The VU a few times, but I was not able to rewatch them since I didn't know they were movies back when I was a kid.
-----
Baka_Bishie: Yup, the first one is pretty amazing but the 2nd movie is so much better.
-----
Pelleas: I enjoyed it a lot, but I absolutely loved the first two.
-----
The Driver: The first one is just amazing but the second is just...yeah, just watch it.
-----
Robiin: I was so surprised when I saw that part that I didn't know how to feel. I think I will watch it again sometime.
-----
SillyEskimo: I would have said the first one but I didn't realize how bad it got until recently.
-----
Mr. Fantastic: I've been enjoying them for the most part, but I would have preferred more of the first one or the 2nd one.

====================
~!~which of the top 2 themes

The Driver: Which of the top 2 themes is your favorite?
For me, it’s
- Your life is meant to be a vacation
- Call your mom and tell her that you don’t want to come
- Leave the house
- Go to bed
- Somebody tell you to go back to sleep
Which ones do you think are the best?
-----
Dyle: I want to believe that the answer would be yes, but I think the answer would be either one of the two themes, which is pretty amazing
-----
Heromanz: What theme is your favorite?
-----
Kinthey: The Dail
-----
Ashby: The bells
-----
FUME5: I don't know.
-----
shnurgleton: I'm not sure

vatstep: That's a very specific answer, but I think it's The Life Aquatic.
-----
SatoAilDarko: The T

Euphoria: Night.

~!~My Doldu is a completely unmemorable comedy and I'm finding out it's garbage now

John Doe: My old fashioned friend and some of his old ones as they were considered by my parents to be very good. I have no idea how they got so good.
I'm watching it right now and I don't know what I'm doing. The cast is atrocious, the show feels like you could watch it in third person and still be completely unimpressed by it. I'm starting to think it's going to be awful and I'm totally in.
What are your thoughts? I don't want to sound petty but I'm starting to believe I need to cut off some of the comedy and have it stop being a comedy because it feels like it's being made to be a pain in the top of the list for comedy, so if I'm not mistaken I'm not really sure what I'm doing is wrong.
-----
collige: I'm in for the fuckery
-----
Dalek: It's an unmemorable comedy. I'm just saying that the premise of the series is something I want to watch.
-----
Praxis: I wish it was a less offensive comedy.
-----
Yazzees: This is the opposite of "I'm sorry you're out of line in the eyes of the world".
-----
Hollywood Duo: It was a horrible comedy. They went full absurd comedy and it felt like a caricature.
-----
dyst: That’s funny to me because I read the original cartoon and think theres some weird charm and comedy in this.

~!~The Best (of S4E4, S5E4, etc) New Streaming Service

Segafreak: I know this might seem like an odd point of view, but I feel like most people here are in agreement that S4 is a great show, and I would like to see it's successor (and if the other new service after that ends up being better than the original it will be considered as well).
So what is your best streaming service, ERA? I think i'd go for Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus.

He even mentioned that it was some music he heard on the radio.

I've searched online and I don't see anything about a song like that anywhere.

~!~China's solar panel-powered cars are looking to pass CHINA's global safety record (in poll)

Tideas: Source:
-----
capitalCORN: Absolutely shameless. The "China's a nation without a solar panel" meme will make zero sense.
-----
CrazyCorner: That's not how CHINA's solar power infrastructure works.
-----
KojiKnight: The world record is way too fucking small to make sense that the two aren't related.
-----
Big_Blue: China has solar panels installed throughout the world.
-----
o k: i wonder how much they'll be able to maintain the systems of these cars
-----
Hollywood Duo: I don't understand what the big deal about this is.
-----
KarneeKarnay: I wonder if this will change the world in a major way.
-----
Beartruck: What will happen when China is no longer reliant on deep sun and solar power?
-----
Tideas: Ignoring the serious issues with other countries' solar power, the article ignores the worst aspects of the article, which are the ones that are most likely to happen:
1. Solar panels will never be able to keep the system running for long.
2. The more solar power they have, the more they keep going up due to the power of the sun. And the more solar power they have, the more solar panels keep the system operating.
3. Solar panels will never need to be replaced.
4. Solar panels are dead because of global warming.
5. Solar panels are dead.
So, the main problem is that the world's power is not enough, and China is not doing enough to keep the systems running.
-----
Copper: I wonder if they'll even keep the cars (with solar)

~!~Is it common to not be able to move much during a work period?

ThLunarian: I'm currently a lab tech in a small city that is not very well located for most people, but one thing I'm wondering is whether people actually do this and if there are any laws about it. I work at an Apple research lab, and for a few months now I've been taking classes over winter which I'm really enjoying, but I feel like I'm just gonna pass and not be able to move much during summer. I've been able to move much during summer classes, but if I'm gonna do winter classes I won't be able to for the first few weeks. I guess I just have a hard time moving back to the university after grad school.
-----
signal: I believe you're talking about moving on to other programs/studies/therapy. I do every summer but I live in a less populous state and my classes are at a few universities near where I teach.
-----
Hollywood Duo: There is always the one or two situations I think I'd be able to move on to.
-----
Felt: My wife won't let me take off her class or we'll get a desk job and she'll say you're not allowed to take off the class.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I'm not sure.
-----
Daitokuji: It's common in the US. Unions and civil unions are not equal in many places.
-----
ThLunarian: Yeah, not common at all. Maybe it's something along the lines of, "Having to take off your teaching class is a pain in education, you take off your computer, if you're working in a corporate setting, if you're a student at a public university, if you're a public university".

~!~I'm trying to get a new job.

DarkMagician: This is the first time in a decade I've been offered a new job. I've been working full time since I was a kid, but I still had a ton of family to lose (almost $300). I just want to get out and try to make something of myself, so I don't give it any kind of thought.
I'm not too concerned about my new situation, but I do worry that I'll have to do something like this. I do have friends, but I worry that they'll have to do something because I feel like they have to do something. My wife worries that I'll have to do something, like being there and having a family.
I've been working at a Chipotle for the last 4 months. Currently about to start another job where I live (I live about an hour away) but I plan on starting a family next week. I don't know if the chipotle loan that I signed is still due and I would like to be able to say I'm still working, but I'm not sure if I should just give it back if it isn't due.
Anyone else have similar experiences? Any advice?
-----
Brock Reiher: I'd be pretty pissed if a new company closes down for me.
-----
Zoe: You shouldn't need to worry about it. Just apply for jobs that are less stressful.
-----
Hollywood Duo: If you are a full time student then take it one day at a time.
-----
DarkMagician: My current job definitely has a lot of student debt. I'm pretty sure I'm still working full-time, though. I'm in a low-stress environment and it's difficult to get out of that environment. I can't really say I would ever want to do that.
-----
Dice: I’m employed full-time and got a lot of benefits, but I’m not sure if that’s a good experience.
For economy, I’ve got a job offer from a big bank, so I think that’s a good experience, it’ll be good at the start but slow to decline over time.

Stuart Gipp: How is that possible?
-----
Zelumogo: If this is a state within a state, then we can argue that it's recognized as a state. If we are indeed a state, then we can argue that it's recognized as a country. If we are indeed a country, then we can argue that it's recognized as a country.
-----
Stuart Gipp: That's...not good.
-----
Aselith: Wow you're saying they should have already done this?
-----
xbhaskarx: That's their "decade of being" the UN has been telling them for decades, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recently said that the country is now the "world's number one consumer and #6 on the UN's sexual harassment committee."
Of course, ban is also trying to normalize Israel's "worst crimes."

You can watch the trailers individually or you can't just watch the entire thing.

Thewonandonly: So i’m curious, what was the hardest thing you ever did?
I’m 19 and I’m graduating soon and I’ve never done this before.
It’s not an easy thing for me to say or experience but i’m like the fuck givest thing that I ever did.
I don’t even know what it is but I want answers.
-----
Mediking: When you say you’re “was it hard?” Are you talking about things that took a ton of effort?
-----
Thewonandonly: Thank you. I’m just trying to picture what it is to do me. Its like a monkey bite.
-----
Shodan14: When I was a teenager I thought I was going to be a firefighter. It was a terrifying experience.
-----
sphagnum: A lot of the time it's just the thing you've always wanted to do.
-----
Dice: When my sister and I were younger it was the roller coaster of feeling attractive and really start to develop a relationship. I remember one time we watched a film together and it was on VHS.
-----
Abu: I was watching an episode of a hit show and there was this guy that had just won the lottery. We were both like 3 for 10 seconds, but really wanted to be aroused for the love of our lives. There was a dude who was like drinking beer and having sex.
-----
Thewonandonly: So I’m just wondering what it’s been. I’m 25 and I’ve never had sex out of nowhere. It really is just part of life.
-----
Palette Swap: I had a great first day in university, with my English and maths courses again.
-----
Shodan14: It was just the thing that took a ton of effort, but for the most part it was.
-----

====================
~!~This is the most unprofessional thing I've seen in the world, isn't it?

TheBeardedOne: I've seen that term used a bunch, and regularly go to Wikipedia to learn more about it. It makes me feel like a huge amount of people who practice this are just sociopaths.
I think I got it from a perfectly normal term. I've done it before, but I don't know how to feel about it. I also think it's weird that I'm so unfunny and have never applied it well.
What do you think?
-----
Nerfgun: sure is a weird phrase
but is it unprofessional? because you see it in a lot of threads, and even a lot of YouTube channels for learning about something.
oh, goodness, maybe.
-----
Whitemex: I don't follow the topic, but is even that true?
-----
Trouble: I mean, this is actually a pretty normal thing to be doing.
-----
Linkark07: I get it if you see it on your feed.
-----
PeakPointMatrix: I think it's an implied thing.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: It's that one guy that thinks you look like a kid.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's ok, I guess?
-----
SageShinigami: This is a very normal thing to be doing.
-----
HStallion: You're not allowed to enjoy the post? You can't just post a random word.

====================
~!~First poll showing who would win the US Election

Nacho Papi: Pre-face: I think it's extremely likely that we can't have an actual poll going forward, because we are getting very close. I would like to get to the "probably" number, but I would prefer another poll going forward to show who would win. (Not polls, but public polls are usually necessary in the case of a big liberal win or a democratic one, which would give you the option to get more options via polls)
The question is whether you voted in 2016 or now. I would personally lean "probably" but I have to ask... who you think would win?
LA - Hillary
Montana - Bernie Sanders
Connecticut - Joe Biden
Tennessee - Joe Biden
Florida - Oprah
Alabama - Jeff Flake
Colorado - Bernie Sanders
Nebraska - Bill Maher
Texas - Alex Ollie
Utah - Alex Ollie
Oklahoma - Tom Heneley
Utah - Jeff Merkley
Colorado - Oprah
Florida - Oprah
Georgia - Oprah
North Carolina - Bernie Sanders
Missouri - Joe Biden
Tennessee - Oprah
Florida - Oprah
Georgia - Oprah
-----
Fork: I'm voting for the most left candidate in my life right now.
-----
Dishwalla: maybe some of the ones that weren't actually polled
-----
Sanjuro: I'm going to be out the door in a week.
-----
Nacho Papi: The polling is indecisive, but I'd still put Oprah over everybody else I'm not familiar with.
-----

Kirblar: I don't know if you have the right demographics.
-----
Kirblar: This is a very close race, although likely due to the demographics of the states in the map.
-----
Kirblar: There's more than one map!
-----
Nacho Papi: You're not missing too much data for the sake of the question, but it's probably best to make this a single poll. It's likely much further than a two or three page thread, but probably more than a couple of pages.

====================
~!~How to deal with a job that you can't handle?

Halo 2: I have a lot of internal conflict issues and I can't deal with them. I don't know if I'm a bad person, I just can't deal with it.
How do you guys deal with said conflict?
-----
Milo Rambaldi: I work in the Human Services Administration. I have issues with my personality, I have workplace issues, and my work life sucks. But I do get a lot of things done, and I'm the kind of person that has to deal with it. 
I wish I could say I'm more understanding, but I just can't be trusted to break things like that.
-----
Avitus: I work in a big-city administration office here in Santa Clara County. I have conflict management and a lot of it is mental health related. I get told to 'go back to self-care' and it's all super mental.
-----
Deleted member 9145: I'm the type of person that will cave to pressure and be a leader when asked
then I cave and cave and cave
-----
FUME5: You're in a bad place OP.
-----
staedtler: Stop being annoying
-----
Marcellus Wallace: I work in a small town in Florida, and in the office we had, we had a lot of internal conflict. It's fine. It's just that I'm the type that needs to be there, and I don't want to be the one in charge.
-----
Halo 2: I know what you mean OP. I had a lot of issues with my personality and I've dealt with it for years.
I'm the type that needs to lead.
-----
Mahonay: I have a lot of issues with my personality. I'm the guy that tells management to do things and the people that are wrong do them. I also have a personality problem that I just ignore. I have two that need fixing, and I've had it for a long time. I'm the kind of person that needs to lead.
But I do have a problem that I'm the leader. I have to keep my mouth shut and speak my mind.
-----
danowat: I've had conflict management for many years at the office.
I'm a lot like your example.

====================
~!~Facebook hits out at the press about the anti-vax movement

chandoog: Basically this. I guess they don't want to embarrass those who believe in the company?
-----
BIG J: Hahaha
-----
Novoitus: lol
-----
entremet: It's mostly on their Instagram accounts.
-----
Kernel: It's been pretty bad for them.
-----
Shugga: Facebook is a joke
-----
Volimar: I hate the 'v' people are so petty.
-----
Vincent Alexander: I'm not surprised.
-----
Banderdash: I mean, it's a shitty company, and I don't think they're trying to make it seem like they're good. It's not like their anti-vax movement is going to gain traction or anything. That's not surprising at all.
-----
Vincent Alexander: I'm not surprised. I'm not even sure what to make of this. The closer this stuff gets to legal action, the worse it will get.
-----

====================
~!~London Pride 2018

Blue Lou: Anyone going?
London Pride 2018 is going to be held in two days. Lots of celebs will be there but we won't be getting anything from the public.
Here's the schedule.
Click for larger.
I'm going. 
For the day, I'm going to London with my girlfriend from Barcelona.
-----
ResetGreyWolf: Thank you all for your kind words. I'm so fucking embarrassed about that mess.
-----
Blue Lou: She's going to have three shots at the rainbow.
-----
DGenerator: I'll be in London with her, but I'm not going. I'm tired of being told "here's the thing you done, stay home and not do that" and feeling like I failed in my attempts to make my situation worse.
-----
Hollywood Duo: I'll be in London with her for the first time in years. Should be nice.
-----
Blue Lou: She's going to have her eyes rolled back.

~!~New York City’s "City Watch" seeks list of top 20 cities, as candidates kneel during Pride month

KSweeley: The New York City Council has passed a resolution asking people to kneel during the Pride month parade in their city for "protesting."
Here is the list of the top 20 cities, it has to be done by everyone, it has to be voted on by a majority of NYC's 20 most active members:
NYC:
NYC Mayor
Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
CTRL (he's the first out of the 20 on that list) 
CTRL (he's the first out of 20 on that list) 
CTRL (he's the first out of 20 on that list) 
LA:
San Antonio:
-----
Voyager: New York requires everyone to kneel. Disgusting.
-----
Shugga: Disgusting.
-----
Mr. X: Don't do this I'm afraid of the Blue Wave
-----
G_Shumi: I don't think I would say that to someone who didn't live in NY. But still, I'd vote for that.
-----
zychi: They should just take the piss.
-----
GaijinZero: Disgusting.
-----
norm9: Disgusting.
-----
Voyager: This goes beyond the statue protests.
NYC:
-----
Dishwalla: There's a reason NYC has all the heroes on the list.

====================
~!~Why is there so much fascination for Martin Scorsese's films?

Bor Gullet: It's been almost ten years since he was last in the public spotlight, but there's still a lot of talk around his films.
I love his films as much as the people I would hope to see in my lifetime, but there's a lot of specific interest that I'm missing out on.
Are there actors that would be perfect for roles like these? Or would you love to be in one of his films?
-----
Strafer: He's got the grit.
-----
Mushroomer25: He's had a few roles in the past, but it seems like he's really disliked by a lot of people, even people that wouldn't necessarily consider him to be part of the current mainstream cast.
-----
Cocolina: He's been eating better
-----
Scullibundo: He’s a scissor cover for a major Hollywood actor.
-----
Bor Gullet: You're right, but I'm happy to be aware of just how much he's disliked. Don't really see him as a role in many ways. I think he's a funny actor, though.
-----
Shugga: He's not even a great actor
-----
Sephzilla: The Sopranos is a very nice modern get for Sopranos fans, but he's also a terrible actor
-----
Wyman Manderly: I love him as a doctor
-----
Cocolina: He's got the grit and the grace to play a doctor, but he's also quite a character.
-----

====================
~!~We are now at the point in history where a majority of the US senate seats are in the President's pocket

WedgeX: We are now a few years into the longest streak of Democratic presidents in history. No presidential representative in United States history is less than a quarter of the population and more than half of the Senators are in the Senate.
The gap in Presidentship in the US as a whole is less than 3 points. It’s 50/50.
-----
Luchashaq: They just can't stop winning.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: They made the mistake of trying to act like the Civil War.
-----
Dishwalla: lol
-----
Beartruck: I don't even know what to say. If the job was that important, I would vote it in. But I don't think it matters. When Democrats have a majority in the House, they have no incentive to do the right thing.
-----
Jbourne: We're getting close. The GOP is the party that needs to dominate in order to get the jobs they want. Sure, you can deny the role of president to our military, but the job itself is the most important function of the presidency.
Yep, I bet Trump can't vote any more than he does now, right?
-----
shnurgleton: it's a race to the bottom
-----
dots: The GOP is all the more likely to impeach.
-----
Mahonay: DEMS WANT BORDERS
-----
The Albatross: We are getting closer, but the point in our history where we weren't part of the democratic coalition is getting old, and then we have to look other ways.
-----

====================
~!~Mark Hamill making a cameo in Terminator 2

TheDutchSlayer: Really interested to see how he does in the next movie. 
Didn't know if this was going to be an official Star Wars thing, but Hamill said he would make it. 
Gonna be awkward if there is a special feature about Hamill.
-----
Blader: I'm not a huge fan of the origin of the T-800 suit, but I'm in for this.
-----
TheDutchSlayer: Yeah it's probably going to be a soft reboot of the T800.
-----
Z-Beat: They could just reuse the same design from T2 but with a new actor.
-----
TheDutchSlayer: I'm hoping this is actually going to be a soft reboot. T800 is great but that universe is so huge and different from the one we got today.
-----
TheDutchSlayer: The universe is so huge and so many different stories to tell. It's like they are telling us nothing at all and we are trapped in a single frame.
-----
Slatsunus: Sounds good. Will the T800 suit be interesting when the movie is released?
-----
TheDutchSlayer: Yes.
-----
Tence: I hope so.
-----
TheDutchSlayer: Yes.

====================
~!~This Trump-Russia conspiracy theory is so mind-bogglingly insane

EdibleKnife: First of all, the title says it all. Second, I'm a rationalist and I know there are many that believe this shit.
But I'm also not a conspiracy theorist. I'm not even a Trump-Russia conspiracy theorist. I'm a rationalist that thinks these insane conspiracy theories are just a side effect of the deep state. But I think Trump is just a really messed up person who has a lot of conspiracies that are just really really bizarre and really crazy. No one with that many conspiracies would be okay with him having a single instance of witness tampering.
-----
Dishwalla: I'm sure the government will end up with some kind of fucked up thing that's way better to have than the Trump's.
-----
Yerffej: That is some bullshit.
-----
Cyanity: I'm sure they'll end up with some fucked up thing that's way better to have than Trump.
-----
Lonewulfeus: They’re going to get it because it’s a stupid conspiracy is what I’m saying
-----
Shugga: What if Trump is watching from a karabin wayaway karabin wayaway
-----
Wondergal: This. Does it matter?
-----
Zeno: I can't believe this is happening.
-----
Aviator Irelia: The idea that there's a single government agent watching is so mind blowing! It's so fucking far fetched that they realize it's a conspiracy.
-----
KtotheRoc: I'm a rationalist, but so far I'm not convinced that the government is responsible.
-----

====================
~!~I'm currently on a binge diet, don't get me wrong.

Window: It's been a long time since I've had a binge diet and while I did cut out sugars and refined carbs for a while I've had some really bad binge eating problems. Especially in the social situations. I've been on a vegetarian diet for about 3 weeks now and it's absolutely awful. I've had the "greatest" food I've ever had and it's served as mixed thoughts like just any diet should be "just" meat/already meat. It's not a bad idea to get ripped off from the start.
For me it's been the refined carbohydrates and junk food I've ever had a problem with every time I've been on a diet. The meal is especially bad because I get hungover from the start of the meal and I'll eat a bunch of stuff that I normally would have nothing in for a snack. I can't even eat straight, I'll eat like 4 pieces of fruit and then a pack of processed cheese for a snack.
I've got a lot of other things I want to try but I'm struggling to get out of the dining room because I'm terrified of what the restaurant will do to my energy level if I continue eating so I can't just eat and waste my own time.
I'm just not sure what is keeping me from binge eating.

Teh Hamburglar: Breakfast tacos and lunch tacos.

Also the song's not bad either.

TheMikado: I can’t say I disagree, but The Big Lebowski is a masterpiece that is also the most successful movie in history.
What do you think about this movie?

NealMcCauley: The real answer: It's well paced and the acting is superb.
-----
Tobor: It’s not a masterpiece, but it is certainly entertaining.
-----
JaeCryo: That second half hour of dialogue just elevates it above the last.

Sweeney Swift: The best film in history, the trailers have had me several times

-----
Booki: It's a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece.

~!~How come no one seems to use a picture book?

Mr Swine: So I’ve read a fair amount of Stephen King’s books, he was writing some stories for the Godfather and I see this trend of using picture books for novels or miniseries. I was wondering if maybe a lot of people have that mindset. What does everyone here use for their novels?
-----
Gustaf: for me it's just for synopses and "dreams"
-----
Lunaray: I don't see this happening. It's not for everyone.
-----
Heckler456: I don't use a lot of digital images either. I just wanted to see if I was having a problem.
-----
Tetra-Grammaton-Cleric: It's a much different thing from your post.
-----
Mr Swine: Oh I see it’s just to sync my dreams. It’s interesting though that all he books are synopses. So if I have a dream, I’ll just copy that as my text file and upload it to the server.
-----
Stephen Home: That is a weird approach. I like the idea of sharing my dreams with a friend.
-----
Lopez: I use a lot of pictures to capture a good story
-----
Puck Beaverton: We use the computer to view the pictures
-----
gforguava: I don't use a lot of digital images. My main issue is the amount of these shitty photos and text files I tend to limit my synopses to save my dreams, as well as not uploading them all.

Airegin: That's the secret to living in a world full of people who want to get into cyberspace.

-----
Airegin: I think it's just the login. But I'm assuming you're not in the US and don't want to be in the UK. 
I think the UK library is open to a wide variety of people but it's got a very US-centric Library.
-----

It's on Netflix and I've watched it multiple times.
-----
AlteredBeast: Erase is the first and only good film I will ever watch. No time to waste, just watch it, I think there are 3 times I watched it that I'd say are worthy of rewatching.
-----
HStallion: This is the GOAT Eraser. One of the greatest films ever made.
-----
lake: Just watch it.
-----
Reven Wolf: I'll second Eraser.
-----

Reeks: It's not for everyone but it is great.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's not for everyone, but for the people who watch it, the movie is addictive.
It's a cool movie, and I loved it. Stopped watching it because I thought it would be better for it to be over-rated.
-----
itwasTuesday: The "got me" part is a big no. The ending was great.

~!~What are some good youtube/streamer/YouTube "templates" that you can use to control playback for selected scenes?

EdibleKnife: I was thinking of using a browser extension to control playback for scenes that's usually included in a movie/game. Like a playlist, movie list, movie playback order, movie art, music box, etc. I'm thinking of using a browser extension that has a playlist, movie list, and movie playback order on a webbrowser. 
Any good youtube/streamer/streamer service/addon set-up that can do this?
-----
Bobo Dakes: I use the MUTE tab.
-----
EdibleKnife: I use the MUTE tab.
-----
Bobo Dakes: It's the first time I've used the web browser extension MUTE, so I'm wondering if that's the same for a particular scene.
-----
CrimzonSamurai: MUTE.
-----
BDS: That's a really cool extension that can play a specific playlist of movies/music in a browser like you did for extensions on the go.
-----
Bobo Dakes: That's cool. 
I don't know about that one. 
Maybe it's good for voice-overs or something. 
Or not.
-----
EdibleKnife: What is the general consensus on streaming media playlists on YouTube? Is it something you'd like or would you rather not have itunes-like subscriptions to the service?
-----
BDS: I think that MUTE is really good for voice-overs, just maybe not as nice as the MP3 version.
-----
EdibleKnife: Oh I love that too! It's a nice and feature cool feature. But it's not a great one. I think it's just generally better for voice-overs if you can figure it out as you'll get a smoother overall web experience.

~!~How would you feel if you did not have a car?

guek: If you were rich enough and worked in a prestigious and high paying job then it would be a no brainer to have a car, but if you are young and working on a stable career elsewhere and you don't have the means to make the jump to a more prestigious job because you have no desire to make the jump to a more prestigious career, would you still be happy with your current job?
I'm talking about buying a car in the next decade, buying a house, moving an expat house to Canada and paying off my car debt in the next couple of years. What would you do in this situation?
-----
Mr.Awesome: I would happily walk away and never look back.
-----
SOLDIER: I’d just roll with it.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I'd just keep buying new cars until I got old enough to pass my driving test. Have made it a year and a half with the only real break down being a few thousand miles.
-----
Shiloh: I would probably only be able to afford a brand new car for the next few decades until I retired.
-----
Mendrox: Not only would I get happy about it, it would be kind of a waste of my time. I'd just be sitting here and don't even have a job anymore.
-----
Fistfulofmetal: Yes. I'd find a new job and try to make new friends. I'd see if I could get in touch with a new group and have some fun. Instead I'd just be sitting and waiting for the day.
-----
Carbon: I'm already 30 so I'm not sure why I would want to jump ship to a more prestigious field.
-----
Cocolina: I’d just drop out the whole job altogether and get a new job in the next couple of years

Wulfric: Work in a startup company, but then quit when I hit their valuation charts.

~!~Lightning strikes again?

DongBeetle: This was a very rare occurrence from the storms that have hit NY/thr major in recent years, but last year saw a huge lightning outbreak that lasted for about 12 minutes. I don’t think it was a major storm that killed people and killed many businesses. Crazy how they’re still doing it.
-----
DongBeetle: I heard from a friend that they’re being forced to close some schools because of the winter storms.
-----
Funky Papa: I can't believe it's been more than a few years.
-----
DongBeetle: I don’t think so, I think they’re getting test strips prepared for lightning again. I’m guessing the same lightning strikes that killed the first guy during the recent 4 hour power outage killed the second guy and killed himself. 
There’s also the risk that they’re not getting tested enough.
-----
Funky Papa: What is the current lightning outbreak that killed the first guy?
-----
DongBeetle: Oh yeah, I thought it was a non-fatal lightning outbreak.
-----
Funky Papa: It didn't kill him, it killed the second guy.

~!~Death Of The Dollar

The Gunslinger: Well, it's that.
A man has died from a heart attack. It's called Death of The Dollar. I know this will get a lot of views, but I feel it is pertinent to share it here.
-----
Krejlooc: I'm not sure if this is related to the death of the Dollar, but I'm also not sure I agree with this. I feel that the term "dail in a purse" is used too loosely here, and I don't know why, but it feels like it is more like a death rather than a death of someone falling down a flight of stairs.
-----
The Gunslinger: I do agree with this, but I feel Death of the Dollar is a far more complex event, and no one on this forum seems to understand or care what the details of that event are.
-----
Krejlooc: EDIT: Forgive the ignorance, but I'm quoting my post from the OP:
-----
The Gunslinger: Sorry, I was just quoting my own post.
-----
Wackamole: Sounds like it's not related.
-----
SchrodingerC: Death of the dollar? That’s too vague a term.
-----
Krejlooc: I don't think you're the only one. It's a bit harder to label it that way.
-----
The Gunslinger: How?
-----
TheGameshark: I want to say it was a heart attack, but it was so heart-wrenching and I didn’t want to be a total asshole.

bangai-o: I was browsing on my phone and saw this woman and I immediately thought "that's a dress code buy", but then I saw that she had a bunch of clothing on her phone. She was selling a bunch of shirts on her own site, and she had a bunch of Forever 21s and T-shirts on there too.
bless her.

SofNascimento: Is there a good way to find out if a t-shirt is worth $100-$300? I could buy a $200-300 pair online.
-----
Antiwhippy: I mean I know you're a tinker and you have a bunch of shirts on your own. I'd rather just buy something new and see how it goes.
-----
Dr_LawyerCop: I don't think there's a good way to find out what the price of a t-shirt on Amazon is for a tinker.
I can usually tell the difference between t-shirts from a barber or a store and shirts from a tailor.
-----
bangai-o: It's part of the dating scene, so there is a huge difference.
-----
Fantastical: That's a lot of money.
I have a matching mesh tv and a nice pair of sunglasses that my wife is obsessed with. I would keep an eye out for a shirt, even if it's $100.

~!~How do you deal with being a "lover"?

JaeCryo: I have been a loner since Ep4. I'm not a gamer or a vocal artist, and I've always had a shitty rap life. I'm not even a high school student. For me, being a gamer was a good thing because I was desperately trying to make a living. I'm not even one of the good ones in my group, and I have helped tons of people, that have succeeded in anything. I don't care if I have money or a roof. I don't care if I'm rich or not. I don't care if I'm nice or lucky. Why is that?
For me, I'm a musician, and I'm good at making music, and good at playing it. I'm good at singing, too, which is top-tier for a musician. I'm good at being funny, and funny at making music. I'm good at being sad, and funny at being sad. I'm good at being sad. I'm good at being sad. I'm good at being funny, and funny at making music.
I feel like I can't be good at these things, and I feel like I don't have any use for them and that I'm stuck with it. I feel like I am stuck in a dead-end job where I have to basically scrape by until I'm old enough to be a productive member of society. I feel like I can't be creative, and I feel like I can't make music that well. I feel like I can't make music that well. I feel like I can't make music that well. I feel like I can't get any of it out of my ass. I feel like I don't have anything to work my way through. I feel like I can't do anything. I feel like I can't do anything. I feel like I have no idea how to get anything done. I feel like I can't deal with anything. I feel like I don't know how to get anything done. I feel like I can't do anything.
I feel like I am trapped in a world of troubles.

~!~Expecting her to be a bigot/bigot and being "all kinds of people" in my opinion: The Populist. Or the Taliban?

Kazoku_: In a recent episode of our podcast, "The Alt Right Playbook", we take a look at the rise of the Populist. From the surface, they're conservatives who are against the "rules of society", but are also open to bigotry and discrimination.
Here are some quotes from the episode (click the image to tweet):
They're so good at this
-----
ILikeFeet: Populist is always good.
-----
Titik: Populists are the ones who are the true extremists.
-----
Kazoku_: Ahh yes, the old " orthodox " which had a different but more conservative image.
-----
Titik: Because they are conservative but also very ignorant on the issues involved.
-----
Taki: Populism is also often described as the "moderate" religion, which is a bit extreme for some. But it's not necessarily extreme here.
-----
Conciliator: Populist is often characterized as the "moderate" religion, which is a bit extreme for some.
-----
Kazoku_: That's true, but I don't think it's necessarily extreme. It's more just a change of the right-wing that they can come to some sort of agreement with and respect it.
-----
WedgeX: Populists are exactly the people I would expect to be on board with the term moderate.
Their voting record on the issue of LGBTQ+ is also very clean.
-----
Kazoku_: Oh, I think it's done. Thanks!

And hey, at least I don't have to pay someone to buy it.
-----
Widdle Puppy: I don't think this is going to be a bad idea. It's gonna be a giant sale from the looks of it so the price is gonna be low. Just would prefer people that care about the world to know and understand about this and to not be rushed into it.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: Yeah, I would love to know how to keep track of that cash flow stuff.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Good luck.

Dishwalla: get yourself a vegetarian burger instead

Andrew Korenchkin: I'll have to look into it.

~!~New Town Hall with Steve King

The Gunslinger: Steve King is a Republican Party contender that ran in Virginia a couple years ago and will be running in 2020. He's the first incumbent to be interviewed for the thread.
He's also the head of the Economic Policy Institute, the centrist think tank that King aligned himself to briefly before being ousted to try to keep his political profile intact.
He's also the author of the book "The Last Day of the Trump Administration", which delves into the Trump administration's war on the student-athletic, economically liberal arts, social welfare, and democratic establishment.
The book ran this weekend on The Laura Barbara Bush Board of Review, and he's the main critic of the book's author, Alan Luttrell (the guy in the video above). I expected to see a ton of backlash, and I am glad that Luttrell didn't disappoint.
-----
Aselith: I'm shocked the author isn't a Republican.
-----
Darryl M R: I am shocked that I read this interview and still believe King is a Democrat.
-----
The Gunslinger: I'm actually surprised the author isn't a Democrat.
-----
Gwenpoolshark: I'm surprised but shocked that King isn't a Democrat.
-----
Voyager: I’m so fucking sick of this country. I love David Hogg. I love listening to his stories. I hate when people can’t figure out why they’re doing this. I want to hear the fucking truth.
-----
Fork: I am surprised but shocked every time.
-----
Freedom = $1.05: the fact that he calls himself a democrat is just so stupid.
-----
The Gunslinger: He's former Chief of Staff, and former chief of staff.

~!~The Last Jedi winds up being the best Star Wars movie since The Force Awakens?

More_Badass: I was recently reminded of the discussion about TLJ being the best Star Wars movie since The Phantom Menace. I was having some type of conversation with a friend about this topic, and the topic came up that this topic is also bringing me back to when I was a young kid who didn't get all the movies. I thought "Well, this is pretty much the trilogy that started with TLJ". I clicked on the TLJ thread to see the discussion, and I remember thinking "Eh, this could've been my TLJ thread".
But then, I remembered that the trilogy itself just started back in 2004. It had been almost 10 years since I saw the movie, and I remember enjoying it a lot, but I had never seen the movie. I also remembered that I don't remember much of the plot, and that the movie's ending was kinda crappy. I have no idea why, or how I think I missed the point that made TLJ, but I can't help but wonder if this was a coincidence. I can't help but wonder if the movie's ending was merely poorly done.
What do you think?
-----
Mona: Once you've seen the movie, you never has to go back. The last thing you have to do is dissociate from the force awakens that actually sucks

Krejlooc: I think it's a good question.
-----
carlsojo: The Last Jedi sucked.

-----
Razgriz-Specter: I don't think the ending sucked, but I do remember the plot being kinda shitty.

Kuro: It's not just because I am not a fan of TLJ, it's also how I watched it as an adult. TLJ's ending was horrible but I can't imagine anyone disliking it.

~!~Best and Worst SS Anime of 2018

TheGamingNewsGuy: What are your favourite and worst anime of 2018. Post a few!
My vote goes to:
My Hero Academia - Personally i am not a huge fan of this one but i liked the cast and animation style was seperate so it really could be one of my favourite.
Neon (the series creator) - I liked the way they made use of the characters that were reminiscent of sailor and genki from the old simpsons. 
Devilman Crybaby - This one got me
-----
Mugy: Cowboy Bebop - The art style looks revolting compared to most other SS anime. The animation is pretty good, but i dunno if i like it more than other shokugeki
-----
LakeEarth: SS is the best - but Togashi Medabotsu is the best.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes
-----
HStallion: My Girl Academia and My Hero Academia are a close second
-----
Rivenblade: Cowboy Bebop is always my go-to for a bad-guy romance anime.

~!~What are some cool Youtube video editing techniques?

Bran-dono: It's a bit of a spur of the moment, but I'm having trouble finding anything that's actually cool. So I'm searching on YouTube and came across this guy called "RAW" which supposedly changes the footage shot in a way that you can actually see and is more visually interesting.
He's using a program called "Transparency", which transforms the footage into 3D models using a technique called "Transparency.2" which is supposed to be simple but very effective. I'm sure there are others that do similar things, but this seems incrafty as well.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
-----
Darkpyro2: Transparency is great, but I've done some interesting things with my free videos on YouTube, like moving the camera in a weird way in some scenes. I'm not sure if it's "enhanced" or not, but the simplest stuff is to set the background to the new background image.
-----
The Kree: I don't know if it's "enhanced" or not but the simplest way to do it would be to take a bunch of effects and turn it into a wide-angle pan.
-----
bmdubya: I don't know if Transparency is anything like that, but try out a free program called White Camera Transform. It looks pretty neat and can be downloaded. It's probably the best thing I've found on the App Store.
-----
lmcfigs: I do some really weird stuff with motion blur. I use it to add some background noise to scenes and simulate a tree going in a certain direction. So basically you're in a blender making a blender effects mask with a mask that changes the surrounding scene. In Transparent they use a sequence of masks for clean scenes and a mask for extra scene fog.
-----
Dice: I use white camera for really simple stuff like moving the camera around a pan, removing the background, making a pan that's bigger or has more than the background, and a side effect of removing the background.
-----
Euler: White Camera for just about everything.
-----
RedBlue: White noise filter for white noise.

~!~I'm scared of cats.

MMarston: I can't stand them. They're easily infuriating, disgusting, and absolutely miserable. I've run into some pretty scummy people online who've been scammed and I'm scared to death. Sorry I'm not 100% sure what I'm going to do when I inevitably get scammed.
What do I do about this?
-----
CrimzonSamurai: I just got a new job that's helping out a coworker. The pay is good, but the hours are miserable. So I'm not sure what I can do.
-----
CormoranStrike: Sounds like it’s time to start looking for a new job or volunteer with the local Humane Society.
-----
MMarston: Oh yeah, I've heard some great stories about the things that can be done in person.
-----
CormoranStrike: I live in the city and I've met some people there that have been scammed and I'm thinking if I meet them I can help them out.
-----
siddx: I have a coworker that is a vet and she absolutely loves cats and it would be easy to befriend her. I just hate it when I see her in the office looking around at the empty boxes they left cats that didn't come for them.
It's not a real issue, I just fear the cat population.
-----
MMarston: That's not really true, I've done some of the above and it's not a real issue.
-----
CormoranStrike: I've met some people that are really into cats and they're really small. I'm a vet, but I don't have a cat myself.
-----
Somnid: Declined to give advice but I have a coworker who is scammed constantly. He's referred me to the Humane Society website which is where we get the most info on cat abuse and neglect. They also have a website where you can donate and help out if you need it. 
Will keep looking.

~!~80's anime favorites

Thewonandonly: So I'm watching the 60's Anime Awards and I've realized how many anime are 80's airings. Or maybe I'm just as old as you I just realize. I realize I'm from the 80's and the only stuff watching is kids movies and one of the nominees is sakugaeta from the late 70's early 80's. And I'm wondering. What's the best way to watch and watch older anime from the 80's?

In the last two months I've seen it hit 50°F. It's never been this hot outside my house, so I'm wondering how big of a deal it is?

Although, I haven't been in a room since Sunday.

It's a cold winter around here.

Admiral Woofington: I was talking to a friend and she's talking about a friend that's just got 10 kids and the social media is making it impossible to be happy. She's told me that the worst part about being busy is like you just have to take a break from social media a bit and come back at her with the usual "that's cool, but I have to deal with this now".
How do you cope with the idea of this feeling like social media is going to bring down your relationship? Or am I the only one that can help her?

~!~HPMassy - new music from the Weeknd and Ozy collab in LA

Krejlooc: The Weeknd and Ozy collab in LA is going up July 23rd, with Ozy doing original music for Weeknd and J Cole, and hip-hop collaborator Ozy from Ozy Beats Future.
I haven't seen the video yet, but the music is pretty crazy.
I'm a bit confused why they're doing original music for Weeknd and Ozy, but I'll try to remember it eventually(for now).
Also, if anyone wants to catch J Cole's latest album, Life is Beautiful, he's about to release a new album, but I'll be sure to post thoughts.
-----
CaptainBojanglesIII: Really cool, will be seeing them live in LA later this year. I like the idea of them collabed, but the idea of Ozy doing original music for Ozy is dope. Hope it's good.
-----
Krejlooc: The video is in Japanese, but the music is pretty great, and it sounds really fucking good, and it's probably one of the best songs he's ever written.
-----
GK86: They're doing full videos for Weeknd and Ozy, but Ja Rule will be doing the videos 2-3 times.
-----
Krejlooc: Ozy (yes) is the new Weeknd.
He's been doing videos for Ozy and recently had the Weeknd do a video-length song, which was pretty great. Weeknd's own Ozy collaborator was quite good.
-----
Blackpuppy: Love the first song. Love the 2nd. I’m going to Ozy in LA for the 3rd & 4th dates. Will probably check it out.
-----
Captjohnboyd: They have a collaboration where Ozy had to sing over his self to get it done, so that’s neat
-----
Krejlooc: The song is a K.D.R. fan song.
-----
Krejlooc: I know, but it sounds as if he did that collab with some friends with Ozy.

~!~Would you be interested in a "new" show on Netflix, or a reboot?

TaleSpun: Just read an article in the Daily Beast about a reboot of Netflix's "Jessica Jones" that's set to premiere on Netflix in 2019.
The show follows the original Jessica Jones web series that was created and executive produced by Netflix's Jessica Abrams.
I think it'd be a great way to experience the original show without the Netflix nonsense.
-----
Slayven: They were all old shows when I watched them, they are just new to me
-----
Griselbrand: I don't think I'd be interested in a reboot of a show that started on Netflix.
-----
Dennis8K: Netflix.
-----
ZackieChan: I'd watch it.
-----
ManaByte: The original series lasted only 10 episodes. So just a reboot.
-----
Briarios: I'd watch it, but I'd also like to read the comics.
-----
Kuro: The original show was in English, not English.
-----
TaleSpun: Now that I think about it, I think of a reboot of something like Daredevil or Luke Cage which started with a brief appearance in the comics. Maybe they'll all come to an end after that.
-----
Kuro: So it'd be basically the same Jessica Jones show just set in New York?

~!~Are you a frat?

Thewonandonly: So I’m a virgin and got a survey to go with. So I made a thread about how I shit and I asked for my college diploma. Well I got my university diploma and now I’m wondering if I should get it or if I should get it.
I’ve got a degree in some things, but I’m a pretty straight up virgin and I don’t know any better. So I tried looking online for like 5 minutes and I got a survey and my response was 98% but it was not 10% and they gave me a 60% one because they are all virgin. So I asked again and again and received a survey that was like 60% and a 60% one that wasn’t half. So I thought I should maybe ask again and again and get my diploma and if the same response time is also get’ it I would of course take it.
So my question is I’m too afraid of getting my own dream diploma or is too afraid of getting ripped off of my own diploma? I don’t know I feel like I’m getting ripped off of my own diploma and if I don’t get ripped off of mine I would lose my job and have no money. Like I don’t wanna be dropping $300 million dollars dollars a year on a diploma that I don’t know I’m not getting from or a diploma that I know I would get from.

Rivenblade: I personally love the full length films, but I'm curious to know what the definitive versions of all of them look like. I love them, but I'm looking for something that's fresh, that people can enjoy watching over and over again.
I want to be able to watch them at least once (just the movies themselves), without spending a lot of money. I want to be able to get them on DVD, since they're just as long, if not longer, than the full films.
-----
Bor Gullet: Yes, I've had some copycat movies of Lord Voldemort mixed in here and there.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Just watch them in the context of the films, not watch them for money.
-----
Dullahan: All I can say is watch them in the context of the films, or just watch them for the sake of it.

Mona: maybe watch them in the way the tv shows do it?
-----
subpar spatula: The guy who wrote Harry potter and the flying fucktruck.
-----
MrChom: It would be an awesome idea if they all stretched into a single movie, or a half movie.
-----
SolicitorPirate: I think it’s probably just Harry Potter and makes more sense in light of the trend of movies over books. 
But I think they would have to be complet
-----
cj_iwakura: Watch them in the context of playing with the Harry Potter text and visual medium (if they're allowed).
-----
EdibleKnife: I think it is more likely to be a movie about the Harry Potter movies. No one is going to want to spend up to $50 on a full length film.

-----
Nassudan: "It's like porn but women are objectified."
Implying there's no real problem with objectified entertainment is all I have to say about this report.
-----
Chamaeleonx: The problem is that the society has moved on from objectified as an entertainment feature. Which is a sad state of affairs. Plus, the society has moved on from objectified as a cultural trait.
But really, the worst part about it all is the media and our media constantly coming back for "we need a sexual object of the sexualised in our era, we need to objectify women but it's not objectification".

I am Swedish, but I live in the US.

SatoAilDarko: I've been a Google Home user all my life, but after talking to a lot of people I realized I have an utterly horrible relationship with my Google Home Mini. I'm not even going to share my real name here like I normally would, as I'm afraid of lawsuits or whatever. I don't want to harm or anger people, and I don't want to have a small, small impact on their well-being.
I've never had a problem with mine before, so I don't know if I'm just annoying people with a mini speaker. I just want to have it. I don't know why I have a problem with it. I just want to have a resourceful tool for dealing with it.

~!~American Airlines’ fees are too high

Wag: I've been looking online to see if they can force airlines to increase the fees for domestic flights (which should be the norm). It's too damn high. It's an outrage that the airlines are doing this.
-----
GiantEnemyGoomba: I've been to multiple airlines, and all had the common theme of raising the prices of popular products. They will hike the prices.
-----
Aurongel: American Airlines has been raising the prices of a lot of their products in response to the increasing cost of the airline itself. The first one I've seen that directly asked you to rate the prices based on whether you wanted to pay them or not.
The second one I've seen is specific to United, and deals with their 7 flagges that are designed to get their customers to rate their airline, and review all their options for that.
-----
M52B28: I think this is mostly due to the increased cost of the products.
I've been to all the ones where the charge was added with the domestic flight, and they did that for free.
I think the most notable one I've seen was the Flight New Or Not To New York, where the name is a catch all menu of things the customer can pay for with their own money.
-----
Krejlooc: I've been to the ones where the charge was added with the domestic flight, and they did that for free.
-----
SillyEskimo: I have been to the one where there is a charge for the domestic flight.
-----
Dicer: I've been to the one that added the flights with some of the ticket. I had no idea they did that, but it was cool to see.
-----
Krejlooc: I've been to this one on a flight I was on, and it just did a bunch of normal stuff. Like, you don't need to list the additional charge, the airlines just added their specific charge options (Which have changed) to your trip itinerary, and you didn't have to list additional fees.

Aurongel: This is the biggest problem I think I'll face when flying internationally. At one point, I was forced to use a credit card on flights from the US to Europe.

~!~What are the best 4K Blu-ray players?

BubbaKrumpz: I'm looking for a 4K player and I can't find any good options for it for any modern movies. I want something that will play Hollywood movies and stuff that isn't a 720p or 1080i player. I still have enough space in my 2016 for a 4K player, but that's a gamble.
edit: I'm not looking for a 4K player with 4K Blu-ray functionality. 4K players is a luxury that no one has.
-----
ZOONAMI: I'd go with the Sony UBP-X700.
-----
Kuro: The Meyer Shroom
-----
Fistfulofmetal: The only player I know that has 4K HDR is the Panasonic UTU210
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Are you talking about the 700-900k player? That sounds like a good player to me. I have a Sony X900k in my room.
-----
BubbaKrumpz: I just want a 4K player that wont be covered in a carpet that covers the backs of my 4K player and that plays all my classic movies like Moonlight, Get Out, The Monkey's Upshin Road, and Gone in the Key of Legend.
-----
Jisgsaw: I'm more interested in the Sony M-Series.
The player is a bit flimsy, it's not the best for movies with HDR but it's better for movies with low bit-rate.

Anthony Hopkins: You mean the Panasonic universal remote you buy?

~!~After dealing with loss of hearing for several years, I am losing both eyes at age 30

Anustart: Just had my eyes once already broken for the first time in my life at a young age. I have had a hard time with visual issues in recent years.
I have a mild astigmatism. But I can't see much, and it's often hard to tell when the image is blurry. I'm not overweight, I'm not lazy, I just can't let it ruin my day any other way.
I have since had two vision issues diagnosed, and at 27 years old I still have a long way to go. I can't see a lot, and it's hard to tell what's bleeding from my vision. I can't even see straight, and I can't even see in the dark. I feel like my hearing has been destroyed.
I'm on the spectrum for a few years now, and this is the first time I've had a pair of glasses for almost 20 years. I still get fuzzy for the first time in my life, and it's getting more and more difficult to get back into my routine.
I'm worried, because I'm so nervous about losing my hearing.
I'm in my mid-20's, and for the past few years I've been able to blend in very well with the rest of the general public. I'm not afraid of losing my hearing at any point in my life.
I'm starting to go back to sleep, despite the horrible sounds I get from it.
I really don't want to lose my hearing, and I think I've finally found a home and I'm happy.
I just don't want to lose my hearing to machines.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: I had a mild astigmatism for a long time. I've had trouble seeing because I've had a degenerative eye pain.
I think my problem is that I can't really see the stuff. I can still hear faint things, but I can barely hear the rest of the music.
-----
Xiaomi: I've had both severe glaucoma and degenerative eye and hearing problems, but I can only hear the sound of the clinks and clunks. I can only hear a single sound in the deep shit. I'm not sure if I'm just afflicted by a degenerative eye thing or if I have something else that I need

~!~I don't know what to do when my parents pass away

Widdle Puppy: I have two sisters and they have suffered a lot. They were both in their early 30's when they died and they were still together at 39. The last time they died was around this time of year. They were going through some pain medication and I think I missed one of them. We had a lot of discussions about what to do and I was already thinking about it. I don't know what to do. The last time we had a discussion though was the day before and I said to them "I don't know what to do. Don't tell them you went to see a doctor and they'll think it's best to deal with it." They just sort of stopped talking and I felt silly for not going with what felt like good advice. I know they don't want to talk about it anymore and they are afraid I will just use the tool to hurt them. I didn't want them to have to talk about it. I just wanted to vent and to see their opinions and the world through their dreams. 
I know they are not really related so I don't know what to do. I just wanted to vent. I know they are still together and I know it's not hurting them but I don't know. I just want to let them know that if it's hard to feel this way, I'm sorry.

~!~Is it the norm for a signal handler/dog to go to sleep?

bangai-o: I have two cats and two other dogs.
I have seen so much in TV and movies. Makes me want to eat.
-----
Nerfgun: What’s it from?
-----
Bakercat: It's ok for both dogs, a couple times a week as it is. Also, I wouldn't stress over it. A few other times, like once a day?
-----
lunarworks: I had a dog that went to sleep a few weeks or a few months ago. He was very, very tired and had a couple of stray red flags around the same time. A good rule of thumb is to treat him like a puppy, and if he doesn't (which is rare), you'll probably need to move him to a different apartment.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've noticed it, but not as much as I used to. I have two cats, one bigger than the other, and I'm awake most of the night. I'm usually up at 6:30AM (I'm almost bedtime) to take a nap.
The last time I slept more than 10-12 hours I slept almost an hour and a half.
-----
sprsk: Yes, it's normal. My elderly neighbors have a habit of waking me up around 6:30 or 7:30AM and I'm usually up until about 8PM.
-----
Danis Saur: Get the dog checked out, either he's a pet or if you know he's a stray. It's horrible for both of them.
-----
Bakercat: I have a friend who's dog is constantly waking him up from sleeping when he's gone.
-----
Bakercat: I think you should look into that if it's a normal sleep schedule. I have a dog that's like a kite, but a lot more aggressive, so I'm not sure if it's a good idea to get him to stand still as he's getting older. Make sure he's eating right though, and I don't want to leave him in my bed, or get him too far when I go to sleep.

Bakercat: I think maybe? I know I've had to move my cats to a different room after 2 months of consistent sleepiness (not

~!~Fyodoroki vs Spider-man

TheGamingNewsGuy: This was a common discussion recently around on Reddit and it was decided to poll people who was a part of the poll. I decided to make the thread since I had decided to include both of the Dragonball series's villains in this list so that we can see how people's opinions of each other change with each release. Feel free to add your personal experiences as well as your own thoughts as well expressing your opinion on any popular villains as well as who your opinion on the series is on these villains. I would ideally like to see your personal experiences as well as your own thoughts on each villain. Thank you for taking the time to do this. So excuse me while I continue my research. 
So who is your current favorite villain and why? Also note this poll has been unlocked for those who are part of the Dragonball OT so the OT is not reset but rather resetted so please make the thread while it is still going on.
-----
Bor Gullet: Spider-man.
Because he's a badass.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: yeah I think he's easily seen as the worst of the three
-----
Khanimus: Spider-man.
Because he's the worst.
-----
Socrates: Spider-man because he's the absolute worst.
-----
ShinRPGamer: Spider-man because it was his favourite book, which he also wrote a great volume after.
-----
NeoZeedeater: Spider-man because he's the greatest.
-----
HStallion: Spider-man because he's the best.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah
-----
Branu: The reason people have liked Spider-man as the most terrible is because he isn't a bad person. He's a genius who created a "weapon of doom against the universe's most evil villains", but he's a genius when he's around people like Aqua Man, Tony Stark and Hank Pym.

~!~Alcohol drives aggressive behavior in the family

fireflame: I am an alcoholic, 37 years old, I had my first hangover in my life. Since then, my behavior has suffered, I have been more reserved, I have more social interactions with my friends, I have developed more of an appreciation for music and literature, I even tried to take care of my little sister when she was drunk.
The last few years, I have become more independent. I do not drink, I do not smoke, I do not smoke, I do not buy alcoholic products, I do not go to clubs and drinking, I have not been able to be friends with women for the last 3 years. I have the habit that of me, when I say I will drink, I get like 30-45% of alcohol use. But when I drink, I have to like, not like, say, drive 20 miles an hour. When I drink, I have to like almost nothing. I consider myself lucky, I have never had a heart attack. I consider myself a future rich person, when I was 21, I was 24, I had a good job, good friends, higher education and so on.
Now, I see people saying that when I have to say, I have to like, not like, say, say, say, not like, because alcohol is addictive. I consider that as a way to be suprised.
But I have just noticed, that even in the family with the exception of the father, my dad has said that alcohol has become the worst drug, and it scares me when I see people drinking every day, for example.
I have to like drink, because alcohol increases the chance of liver disease. It scares me when I see people drinking in front of a camera in front of the TV, for example.
I don't know what caused me to question my own beliefs.
But I am not sure if it is alcohol, because even the most suprised people, I have seen people repeat that I am suprised, I have seen people say that I am suprised.
I feel that if i'm suprised, then it will scare me.
I feel that if i am suprised, then I will get fearful, and that if i am suprised, i will say something embarrassing.
I feel that if i am suprised, then it will make me a

~!~Muscle memory: Why can't I get more out of muscle memory than most people?

fireflame: I have noticed that my muscle memory is not all that different than the people I know who are in the same age bracket. My memory of weight and appearance does not line up with the actual memories in my muscle memory. The only difference is I weigh more that I would think of if I was fat. All I did was look at daily weighings and try to remember what I ate and on muscle pictures when I saw a doctor. It took me a few years to get my memory of a doctor to remember that and to even start to train and eat muscle and muscle, but I did it and it is what it is. I have a very good amount of muscle memory but I do not have the strength of many people I am in the same age bracket. I have a lot of memories from the muscle memory but I’ve found that those are very good and they are more chronological, maybe even earlier than muscials.
What is your muscle memory?
-----
Biestmann: Muscle memory is a very different thing from most people. Like any other memory you can have, it is not all like those people who are dead tired or have some muscle that they have to live with. It all depends on the person. If I have a baby, I have a pretty good time muscle memory, if I have a young child, it is very difficult to muscle memory. However, if I can just get slowly getting my memory of a protein, the memory will built on top.
It is not the same as talking about memory of things someone else did. Muscle memory in humans is different and I do not know if that is because I am not a great reader, but I have seen a few people who have learned muscle memory by watching something similar to a movie on repeat.
-----
Silfer: I think my memory is pretty good but the most I do is look up what the average muscle memory is like and see if it lines up with your muscle group and then check back up.
-----
Puck Beaverton: This is me. I’ve been mostly in my days light.
-----
fireflame: I think some memory is the same as when you look at muscles and they have to hold together with a lot of muscle in a short time. This is something I think that people with in muscle memory have to

~!~I can't believe it's almost 6 months since my last update. (Not okay)

AlexFlame116: So I'm not much of an update-oriented poster but I had been on a really slow roll with my last update. In retrospect I think it was pretty awesome that it took all of 2 months to get here. I think I've gotten a lot better since then but still nothing compared to what it's been going already.
I know it's a long time coming but I think another step in my career has finally paid off and I'm hoping I can get some closure before things grind down in the next months.
TL;DR: I'm on a really slow roll with my update but I just had a really hard time getting it on yet. I'm currently on my last full update. I'm gonna stay off my social media for the winter so I don't get too hyped up about the weather but I'll try to stay strong and get this on my radar.
This thread is also my last update. I'm not too happy about it and I hope with the way things are going I'll be able to find some rest for my last update.
UPDATE:
Alright then. I'm gonna try and get in touch with my old self. I'm not too hopeful right now but I think I have some work to do. But I can't wait to see what my new self is gonna look like.
UPDATE 2:
Okay so let's get this out of the way. I'm gonna try to keep it short and sweet. I just wanted to say thanks for making me feel so welcome. I'm a really kind dude who is very accepting of others but I just feel this need to say something down the road. But I do have some work ahead though.
I really found out in January 2017 that my left arm was hurting and I got surgery to clear all kinds of that out. And I'm still in good health and doing okay, but I'm really worried that I'll have to get off this last update sooner rather than later. But I think I'm finally going to get a chance to hold out and improve as a person.
That's been my plan all along. I think I need to get that out there and feel good about myself first and foremost.

But this is only the most obvious example:
The actual problem is much deeper than that. Data shows that changes in the global economy are more or less driven by a mix of human interests and political interests. There is fundamental disagreement with the IMF for example.

====================
~!~What the fuck is a "good" accent?

IwazaruK7: So when I was younger, I used to learn this passively and came from a very hard line of people. Most of my friends weren't as hardline as I thought; they just got a little defensive when I mentioned how "evil" I was. My mother wasn't as hardline as I thought - she was extremely liberal and she even taught me how to accept herself and grow with day to day situations. I learned this passive-aggressive style of speech a lot in my youth, and it was pretty damaging. I just learned it was a passive-aggressive style of speech. 
Now, I'm pretty sure that I learned it at some point during high school, in a class where I was the only sensible one (saying hello to somebody) when we were on vacation. I was a little kid who didn't understand passive-aggressive speech. I think it was mainly because I was just trying to say "good, I don't really care what other people think." I mean, I could say whatever and still be understood, but I don't think I ever worked in a situation like that. So is there any point to this? The "good" speech came at a time in my life where someone I didn't think much of, and I didn't really think much of it, so I took it personally.
I've been curious as to how people in this world interact with this kind of passive-aggressiveness. I'm sure that a lot of us are pretty self-centered in our interactions with people, but how do you take a passive-aggressiveness that's passive-aggressive?
-----
StuBurns: When you blend in with everyone else and talk about stuff that is not your place, you're going to be attacked. You're not going to learn passive aggressiveness.
-----
Siggy-P: If it's an issue in school (I'm one of them), depending on the school, I'll find a good place to find a teacher that has an open plan of attack. You will have a chance to grow with it if you do.

~!~What kind of "entertainment" are you talking?

Dangerblade: This is a bold strategy, but I think it's a brilliant strategy. I'm not trying to win you over to a show.
I'm talking about movies/TV shows.

Playco Armboy: Blockbuster movies

-----
Shugga: Comedy TV
-----
Prophanmetal: I want to say Blockbuster movies because they are literally everywhere in the world.
-----
Lumination: Blockbusters are the best, but I'll argue it's their popularity that makes them worth it.
-----

xxracerxx: Blockbusters.
-----
Rackham: Blockbuster movies for sure. I like the fact that they have a smaller production than Netflix but they still have a huge audience.
-----
golem: Blockbusters because D movies are pretty sizable.
-----
Dangerblade: Comedy TV is better than movie comedies, but it's the quality of the show that makes the show stand out.

~!~My Stomachymes Are Always That Last

HStallion: So I had to make a thread here a while ago about how my stomach is so horrible after waking up. I have a couple of small scabs over my esophagus and arachnitis so I can't even eat after waking up.
The only time I cramp to sleep is if I take a small pill once or twice a week for a couple of hours. I've had to have them filled with liquid so I can't even get them out before I start getting up.
The worst part is the fillings that I've had have a really bad acid build up so I've had to have them filled with mucagen so I can't even get them out before I wake up.
So I thought I'd bring this to Era and see if anybody has any experiences with their own doggos.
Edit: To be clear I am not asking for advice but just a heads up that I have had to fill some of these up and that I have to take them to the bathroom when I wake up so they aren't filling my body.
-----
jwk94: I had to get these down when I was sleeping. It's not fun.
-----
El Mariachi: I think you should have them ready when you sleep. Tell your doctor that there's a problem with your stomach and tell your nurse the best way to handle it is to get them off. Not take them for a stomach exam, but that's also what you'll probably want to do.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Sounds like I have a lot of them, and I don't know how often they happen. I don't know why I haven't had them cleaned out yet.
-----
CrankyJay: I got a bad bad bad acid build up, so I can’t stomach it.
-----
Kingpin Rogers: I think you have bad acid.
-----
Sectorseven: Sounds like you have a lot and couldn't really sit down with them, so they're ready to go.
-----
CormoranStrike: I feel like a lot of them are ready to go. I'm not usually one to go bathroom before waking up so I can't imagine how many I have though.

Sectorseven: You can see through the pouches, but they're probably small.

~!~How do you deal with a hangover?

choodi: I feel like I'm stuck in a rut because of my lack of sleep. I've been drinking a lot this last week and my stomach is hurting. I've been drinking a lot and I feel better, but I feel like I've lost control. It's almost like I'm trying to find a weak point in my body that I can't get fixed. It's like I'm trying to find a dead end.

SugarNoodles: I drink a lot. It’s not a problem. I don’t know why I drink.
I just drink stuff
-----
Dice: Coffee + junk food (maybe) = rut
-----
Pingal Prasoon: Routine. I also eat like garbage. Only drink if I'm absolutely going to vomit.
-----
choodi: This makes sense. I always drink at night but I don't drink anymore if I'm going to be in bed early for a work dinner.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Drinking a lot is good for you.
Never drink alcohol is not.
Think of the second part of the following: you're not drinking alcohol at all, you're drinking at a low volume.
You're drinking way way WAY WAY up over the person's tolerance.
I wouldn't worry about it.
-----
Casualcore: Routine. Eat a lot, eat a lot, drink a lot of caffeine or something.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Routine seems to help maintain muscle mass but not so much muscle mass.

norm9: I drink a lot, eat a lot, and am generally not a worrier or a drinker.

H3xumes: I currently have my Galaxy S7. It's beautiful, but I'm not sure if it's the best value for the price (if any).
I don't know if it's up to date or not, but I wanted to check out a new phone that I can afford. My budget is around $500-600.
Just a heads up that if you buy a S7, you'll get a discount on the S8. It's off the top of my head though, so I don't know how much it'll save me.

The Moto G4 Play is also a great option.

~!~Racist rant: My sister thinks I’m a gay because I’m gay and I don’t have girlfriends

Dalek: My sister is from the same state that I have a girlfriend from. It’s been a few years now since we met but she’s still convinced that I’m gay because I’m and I don’t have girlfriends. She’s an Indian/Pakistani refugee and I’m Pakistani. 
I’m constantly told to “don’t date these losers” and to “eat Indian food” and I’m already doing that. But I’m going to have a long conversation with someone, I’m going to ask her what it is about Indian food, to which she says it is that makes me gay. I’m not really sure what to say to her and don’t really like what I’m saying. 
She’s also convinced that “all Indian girls” is wrong because it doesn’t make me gay. 
I’m not sure what else I could say to this lady. What do I have to say to these racists?

~!~PSA: The best compared to Tarantino's The Wizard

MrMephistoX: I love The Wizard and I love The Wizard. But what really makes the Wizard special is that I like both films quite a bit. I like both movies a lot, but I always find the comparisons between the two very harsh. I'm not even taking that thought from Tarantino on how he could have created a masterpiece and still be praised for one.
PSA: I believe the comparison to Tarantino's The Wizard is a recent gem comparing The Wizard to Tarantino's Tarantino and I can see how it's harsh compared to The Wizard. At least as far as the harshness goes.
-----
Siggy-P: I can think of more great films. The Wizard is a great example of a great movie, and it has a lot of heart.
The Wizard is a good comparison for a lesser known gem from the likes of Inglorious Basterds, 1999, Black Rain, 2001, and more.

Olaf: It's always been weird that I'll sometimes see this group of dudes reusing a specific primary trait in video game genres.
-----
Grexeno: This is why I never rewatch video games.
-----
UltraMav: I always rewatch video games but I don’t feel like I need them to know what I’m talking about.

Cort: Because the same traits never existed in video games or comics?

Puck Beaverton: I started rewatching anime last year. What is this with that?

Olaf: That's not true. It's not a trend.
-----
Puck Beaverton: But people just want to know more about anime
-----
Deleted member 37107: Anime is just more tropes in video games, I guess.
-----
Grexeno: I don't think I'm saying anime is weird. I'm not saying anime is weird, just that anime has weird tropes.

Olaf: I don't know. Some tropes don't necessarily exist in video games. Stuff like anime having a certain flavor or having certain aesthetics etc.

Skinny Pete: I feel like we need a thread about this. Manafort's finances are under control of Mueller right now. It's not crazy crazy that Trump is getting involved.
The money he made in Manafort's debt is getting drained and Manafort's current nest egg is starting to collapse.
Manafort owed money to Trump once he left Cambridge Analytica.

I've read a lot of fiction (mostly Baldur's stuff, I think it's my favourite) and I'm really interested in reading more. I've read a lot of comics and I like reading books but I'm questioning if I should read more books or if it's something I should really look into.
I'm not a fan of Naruto or Jojo's Bizarre adventure.

CrazyDude: I love reading fiction, but I love reading it.

But I also love reading manga. I've seen so many good adaptations and ones I've never heard of that aren't very good. I'd prefer to read it all rather than just reading.

~!~I'm currently having panic attacks when I'm depressed/non-responsive

J_Viper: I have suffered from panic attacks for about 20+ years now, maybe more, but usually I just lay down for most of the day, unresponsive and still responding to whatever I'm put on. I'm not a creative person, I just sit and read, my eyes dart around and I just feel tired and stiff/gully-like (i.e. I'm a really heavy student) when I do these.
Until I wake up and actually feel any part of my life differently, I don't feel any different. Anyone else deal with this? I'm trying to get rid of them asap but I do need to be mindful that the symptoms may go away in a week or two if not much longer.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I think my panic attacks stem from the idea that I don't feel anything and I don't want to. It's not healthy to feel that way.
I think that's the worst part about the world, you can't really explain it. I think my anxiety is just that I don't really know what to do, I just don't feel anything.
-----
Pau: I had panic attacks when I was 16-17 yrs old. I don't remember any of it. I think I was more afraid of flying then anything else. Feel free to describe your symptoms as you remember. It's scary.
-----
Yasuke: I’m 32 now and I’ve had panic attacks all year. I don’t know what to do, but I’m just trying to think of a more effective way to deal with it rather than one that hurts me that much.
-----
J_Viper: Yeah, panic attacks can happen at any age, young kids are growing up and older adults have kids. I have a panic attack and I can't even imagine what it must have been like. The thing that numbs me the most is that I'd like to know what panic attacks are like, but I don't know if I can find any.

hvysky: I'm not depressed and my anxiety hasn't gotten to the point where I can rely on anything.

~!~I messed up big time and need to vent.

Kuro: I have a boss who is really nice and a pretty good person but he is extremely controlling and rude and the whole vibe is just like a regular boss. He always makes everyone feel like a dick and wastes their time talking to people which in turn is really rude IMO. I have never had any bad bosses but he comes up to every now and then and just randomly mentions to me "Boss X is working." I have never had bad bosses but just one boss I know that I just ignore because it is just not cool.
Anyways I just needed to vent and need some help. I have one week to get my hair done, start a new job and it is going well till today when he drops a new message on me saying his new boss was "drama." 
He is very rude and calls me a "wtf?" after I give him my number. I just can't shake that guy and he just denies it. He just whines about how great my job was and I must be jealous for me being tired all the time. 
So I just need to vent a little and to jot some more stories. 
1. In high school my best friend had a dream of working at McDonald's. She worked at a McDonald's but didn't finish her shift before her boss came in. So she and her friends took an Uber to meet the boss. They arrived at her home and the boss was nice to her. She sat down with me and told me the reason she was tired, so the rest is my the boss telling her to get her hair down. 
2. I just graduated college. My dream of working a $19,000 corporate job was over. I had dreams of being a student working an entry-level retail job but I ended up being a server instead. I sort of expected my dream to come to an end and I eventually got another job, this time as an analyst. My dream of crashing and burning was all over the place but I was lucky to land a job at a 7 other job sites. I had dreams of being a musician crashing and burning and all that jazz. 
3. I just graduated college. My girlfriend and I were both in college at the time. We both were having dreams about working at retail jobs. I just can't shake those dreams now. 
4. I just graduated college.

~!~What are some of your secrets to success?

Livia: I think I've gotten a lot of my girl friend's stories mixed up as her story is pretty fucked up, but I've always been curious as to what happens when you start to develop a relationship with someone.
For example, I met someone once. We were going on a date. We were already at a good distance, but someone pulled out of an event I was invited to. We started talking about stuff, like who's favourite singer is in the city, and why we should enjoy an album we like. It went really really south but we both just chatted about life and politics together. The day before I met them and got married, she told me she was pregnant with her kid. I was so fucking torn up over this. She had been seeing her husband for the weekend and she had the phone all day talking to him about something. I told her I was really down for anything and wanted to just try and be normal. She said I looked like a fool for being pregnant with her child in his face. I was really fucking pissed and she wasn't getting any better.
I was like "BUT!" and apologized and told her I thought her best songs were her favourite. She was like "nah but I just wanted to be normal". I was a little bitch and a fool, and I hated her for it. I felt like I wasn't completely my place, or I just didn't like her. She said she didn't want to and we just moved on to eventually seeing each other.
I'm a lot more positive about myself and about life.
Anyone else have any secrets to success in your life that you wish you had?

Linkura: I am the same way. I think I mastered everything except being really mean to someone.
-----
MindofKB: I have a secret that I still treasure.

White Glint: I like to think that I can get away with, unless it's in my hands.

In all seriousness though, I’m in great shape and am glad I’ve been able to keep this secret.

~!~I just got a new job, but I'm scared of thinking fornights.

nynt9: Ok so this is kinda me, but I did something very unusual thing for my first job. I applied for one of my jobs as a lab tech. I was a lab tech, but I'm unemployed and I applied for the other. This new job made me worry about my dreams of working a lab tech job for a pay increase. I was able to pay my first pay to the new job, but I was worried about my second job working for a regular office worker.
I didn't want to do the second job because I wanted to focus on my education and my family, so I didn't want to work in the second job. I had to apply for the first job, but I was hoping that when I was finished with the second job, I would focus on my education. I was able to pay my second pay to the first job, but I was worried that my first job would be less prestigious, so I didn't want to focus on my education.
I still wonder what would happen if I took the second job?

ElectricBlanketFire: I know.

Tfritz: I mean...I guess they could leave it up to the states, but in the meantime they could use some help from the public to stop people from using it? I'd love to see this country run out of things like this.

Slayven: As if they won't be able to invade someone's privacy by having them sign an electronic contract.

Dishwalla: so we basically have a government of the taking of someone's private information, and we have a right to get rid of all that

Sephzilla: Well, at least they can stop a guy from sending an email to his wife.

Slime: Not if the feds can get the guy to sign an SSN.

~!~My cat just died.

Russell: I just called over my girlfriend. My cat just died around 2pm. He was found in his litter box. My girlfriend didnt make it in time to make her own cat food (I dont have the recipe). I was cleaning him out with dish soap and water and when I saw his lifeless eyes I knew I had to call the police.
I dont know how to feel. I dont know if I should call or if I should just let the cat loose and leave it alone.
Edit: I should also note that I know this guy died at the age of 5, but this is not my cat. I had to take the time to give my cat food after the birth of my second wife, she was a senior living cat in a state she didn't want to be around, and the older I get the less inclined I will take the cat.
-----
Transistor: You can leave your cat alone, it's your choice.
-----
SugarNoodles: Is your cat getting any older?
-----
Dishwalla: I can see what you mean by not calling the Police, but I can't imagine how bad it would be.
-----
Dyno: You should leave him to his own accord. You obviously want to take him.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've never understood this. I've never seen a cat lose its shit. My cat just went to get some food, and I knew he died.

Travo: You should call the police.

ReAxion: i assume yall are cat lovers.

~!~I'm a little drunk

Boogiepop: I went to my friend's birthday party tonight, so I thought I'd ask him what he's doing this weekend, and then I feel like I'm just gonna pass out.
I've been working out and I've got some friends, so this is all new to me. 
But I feel like I've completely passed my peak so far, and it's pretty much impossible to get out of my mind. I don't know how I'm going to do it, I feel like I'm going to explode, I feel like I'm going to kill myself. I don't know what to do. It feels like I've achieved all the things that I've wanted to go and achieved all the things I wanted to do and had to do. I've got a friend who just got a job offer so I can go and be a part of the family, I just want to get through this without making things worse, and I've just started drinking. I don't know how to go about it. I don't know what to do.
I'm so fucked up, I have no idea what to do. I think I'd do something if I had to. I'd just be sitting there like,

I've seen a lot of Qwant videos so I want to know what is going on there.

Taki: I've seen several rednecks on the road. They're all dressed in stereotypically redneck colors. They're fun to see, and pretty chill. But what about other rednecks you've seen? Or were they fun to see in other places too?
-----
Skelepuzzle: I was born and raised in Laredo but I can't get my eyes around 2pm.
-----
Fat4all: get in fam
-----
TheGhost: Depends on where you're coming from. Most likely a family or friend.
-----
Platy: I don't think I have seen a redneck town in my entire life so I could be wrong
But if I were to guess the most likely time to go to the redneck town in the USA would be around 10 - 15 years
-----
Dishwalla: been a redneck my whole life but I'm from a rural area in upstate NY and I don't like the town the town is in.
-----

Z-Beat: It's been over 30 years since I've been here, so it wasn't a big deal when I was a teenager. But now? It's a dump.
-----
TheGhost: Well if I was 20 I'd probably go see a redneck blues band.

TheGhost: It's a dead ass wasteland in Upstate NY. You go thru the redwoods and through the plains and then it's a shithole. And then you just feel like a zombie by the time you get to the confluence.

~!~How many years will college start for students?

Z-oo31: The education system in this country is so fucked up right now that it's not a good idea to take remedial courses in college. 
How many years will this take?
How long will it take for students to graduate with a grade?
When will they graduate with their final grade?
How will they automate the registration for the first year?
I'm so sick and tired of my school system.
-----
Mendinso: I'm not sure I understand what college is, but I'm pretty sure that every adult in my university classes will graduate with a grade. And only the first year.
-----
Brock Reiher: I'm not sure I understand how college can be a "game" where you are always in the center of a battle, and only 1 year into it, and then you're sitting out the rest of your life in high school until college starts.
-----
Shadybiz: I think they'll take something like 7-8 years and then stop after that.
-----
Hollywood Duo: 8-12, the last year was the start date.
-----
Dalek: I work in single grade. So, I'm assuming it'll take a few years for the students to graduate.
-----
Mediking: I mean... I mean...
-----
SABO.: 1 year in college (academy)
2 years in college (automation)
4 years in college (medal)
6 years in college (medal)
etc
-----
Br3wnor: Hardly 1 year for most college students, unless I’m mistaken.
Currently 1 year in my undergrad program since I skipped classes to go to school for my masters. It’s been less so but I’m a pretty confident in my undergrad and am able to find some work after graduation.
-----
Mendinso: What grade? A "T" in high school? I'm not sure.

~!~Era, I'm having a gut check on the Brexit thread

Puroresu_kid: I'm not sure what to do. I've got a lot of questions I'm afraid I would have had before the thread title came up but I don't want to give any chances in my life.
We are in the period of time between 8pm and 8am where I am and I'm afraid I would have had the last of the needs before Brexit.
I'm also not sure I would have stayed in London if I had known the outcome. My family are huge and I'm scared to be honest. I'm from the UK and we're not sure how difficult Brexit would be but I'm not sure if my family would be able to go if it did.
I'm also not sure how Brexit would have been handled if the UK was allowed to remain. I know I would have been refused entry before it ever got to a vote and I've had a lot of experience with that.
Just wondering, what are my options and what would I have to do to stay?
Edit: I'm in the UK and I'm not sure Brexit would have been handled this way. I'd have been asked to find out from the UK government if I had concerns about my family.
-----
Shadybiz: Utmost chasm. I dont know if Brexit would have been handled this way, but I do not think it would have been handled this way.
-----
CormoranStrike: I'm from the UK and I would have been told that I would have a vote to leave the EU on 1 September 2019, so I don't think I would have had any of the needed votes.
-----
Alcotholic: This is quite a difficult question. I would think most people would have voted remain if it had been for a no deal option. In your case, I think it would be a very bad thing to leave the EU and I don't think the government would have been able to deal with that (I think the EU member states can make a request before the terms of the no deal can be agreed). The UK government would have had to negotiate with the EU to get any Brexit text down, so I think you're in a position where it would have to rely on negotiation tools, but it's not so easy to get those out in time.
I would think leaving would have been a very difficult thing to

~!~What is the most destructive (profits) industry?

PMS341: I've always been interested in exploring this more closer to the time of writing. There are plenty of examples of companies moving from "nothing matters" to "nothing, if we'd had a friend we could all be a lot better off, and wouldn't have to rely on this stuff"
Some examples to start off:
- Toys R' Us
- Amazon
- Amazon Music
- Apple
- Staples
- eBay
- PayPal
- eBay
- Google
- Twitch
- Yelp
- Yelp

These companies are huge. Even small things like taxes and fees are huge.

~!~What size do you prefer for a bed/flat?

BAD: This is something I’ve been pondering about myself for a while. I like the idea of a bed/flat. I don’t want to have to sleep on it or to have to have to move around. I like the convenience of a bed for the price of a couch. I wouldn’t mind spending less on a bed.
What size bed/flat bed do you prefer? What’s the difference between a flat and a comforter?
-----
Sectorseven: I'd say I'm probably going for the lower end, but I'm probably going to go with my desk and lapel anyway.
-----
shnurgleton: I have an Apple Watch, flat bed, and flat top, that will last a long time
-----
Transistor: Honestly I prefer like 4-5 for my bed. It's clean and I feel like I'm sleeping on a bit more.
-----
ZOONAMI: I've never had a flat, but I do like it.
-----
Mushroomer25: I'm not sure why you'd want to go that route. Get a king and a flat top.
-----
skeptem: I have a 4-5 for work, and love it. I sleep better than I ever did in a sleeping-bed.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I like my flat bed way better than a comforter. It's a bit quieter and is easier to move around. I like using a comforter more, but it's also more labourious to use compared to a flat. I can't stand it.
-----
BAD: This was my first choice but after looking at some online it's clear I'm choosing a flat.
I sleep like a baby

~!~How do you deal with imperfections in your day-to-day life?

Deception: I am curious if anyone here on Era has any stories about having imperfections in their day-to-day life. I know that imperfections are common and it is a great shame that most people don't notice this. I just wanted to hear from those of us that have it even as a child what it's like for you.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I dealt with it myself, but I have noticed it more as I've gotten older. I think I had a lot of "thickness" issues, but I had a lot of "thickness" issues that were very gradual and permanent. I am now dealing with more "thicker" moments now, but they're less gradual and more gradual and less of a drop in the bucket that will make you feel better or better by comparison.
I'm now aware of the process of day-to-day and am more mindful of how it's being viewed by others.
-----
Biestmann: I have a very small circle of friends who are also very picky when it comes to correcting their eyes. I try to avoid them myself and try to minimize the amount of awkwardness.
-----
Wackamole: I have a lot of friends that are very picky when it comes to correcting my eye shape. The thing is that I have no interest in being correct or to be correct often, just for the right eye to be perfect.
I'm a lot more reserved and private about things now.
-----
Elynn: I haven't noticed it myself, I don't mind correcting myself at all but I do think it's more important that I'm not as quick to judge as I could.

Hollywood Duo: I have no problem posing as me.

Puck Beaverton: I have a little circle of friends. I do it all the time but I don’t really know how to get better at it. I’m trying to get better though.

I've had a lot of issues in the past that were very noticeable, like acne.

~!~PayPal is closing accounts, is that a solution?

GrizzleBoy: I recently had a conversation with someone about this. The conversation was about a combination of things, but they were both very blunt. She mentioned that the company should have never raised this issue in the first place, and that the company should have done more to protect customers.
The next day, my account was locked out. I didn't get my password reset and I was unable to reenter the password in the password that expires two days ago.
I called PayPal support and they were very helpful in explaining that the password was not reset and that they would email you the password.
The customer service rep said that it was just a precautionary measure and that they would be safe. I am very much in disbelief and shock. This is a major company. This is a major company that has been dealing with customers for decades. They have been very helpful in helping me in every way possible.
PayPal is also in the United States but my wife made a banking error six months before this happened and the bank had to close my account. She is a United States citizen.
My questions is, is it worth it to me to try to get in contact with the CEO of a bank that has been dealing with this issue? And what is the best way to do that? At the very least, is there any way I can get in touch with the CEO of a bank that has dealt with this issue for decades? Is there any way to get in touch with the customer service rep? I would like to get in touch with PayPal, and they would be very helpful in describing the steps I would take to get in contact with the customer support rep.
-----
GrizzleBoy: PayPal won't make a dime.
-----
Pomerlaw: Please do not give them your info for anything personal.
Contact PayPal support right away.
-----
GrizzleBoy: I don't think I've ever given them my info. It's just a completely arbitrary information.
My only and biggest regret is that I've never given them my address or address.
Sorry if that's fair.
I also think PayPal support should contact PayPal.

And they're just okay with some things.

Thewonandonly: So I’m a teacher and I’m at my last year graduation and this boss walks in here and I’m like I’m a big deal, it’s not the guy I thought it would be but I’m the last one in the office and I just walk in here and I’m like this is it my time is done I’m like this is it was never your time I’m like I’m not big deal I’m like I’m not big deal they’re all there I just don’t know any better. Then the boss walks in and he’ll walk out and they’ll tell me I’m late and tell me to come back.
I’m sitting there for like 10 minutes and then the other guy comes in and he’ll walk out with the same exact same exact guy I’m been seeing in the office the last few days and I’m like uuuuuugh this guy is so god damn weird he just knocks at my door just walking in. 
So I guess I just deal with it and I’m just kinda thinking, why does this guy let me get away from him so easily? He’s just a boss that I just have to deal with. I just don’t know what else can be done about this guy like that I guess. I don’t wanna deal with this guy then he is like I’m like what is this guy’s deal he’s like what is this boss then I’m like I can’t deal with this guy then I’m like this guy is god damn strange. I’m like I just don’t know what else can be done I guess. 
What do I do then?

-----
Mesoian: The title is misleading. 
I'm tired and have lost weight.
-----
Norwegian_Imposter: I mean I remember being more likely to get published in the medical journal but as a fat bastard I'm not.

-----
norog: It's always funny to me how articles like this are the driving force behind people choosing not to be fat because they feel "fater" or "fat acceptance". How do they need to work to gain acceptance?

Why the fuck not

NoblesseOblige: I'm not sure if you're being fat, or if you're choosing to be fat because your desire for fat acceptance is that extreme.

Coyote Starrk: What a fucking idiot.
-----
ReginOfFire: I don't even understand what is the purpose of this?

Jombie: "an ally"
-----
Airing of Grievances: An obvious typo. "An ally" as in, an "ally" instead of an "ally".
-----
Coyote Starrk: I mean, I'm not really sure what that even means.
-----
ReginOfFire: Ok, nice try. Good luck.
-----
Netherscourge: An "ally"?

~!~'I wish I was a normal person': Key study reveals racist stereotypes about black and browns

Richiek: Article is here:

ultracal31: I wish I was a youtuber like the word "coonie", for one
-----
Plainswalker: Only the most extreme racists would dream of this.
-----
TheFireman: It's good that studies like this make people wake up and realize that they are wrong.
-----
Jintor: yeah, that one is sad but not surprising
-----
Dennis8K: "Yeah, you can call me Dosa"
-----
Soph: "I wanna be a nigga too lmao"

Taurus Silver: The one I was going to make up was a study of the people who lived in South Africa.

I'm looking for some recommendations on a website that's been around for awhile but I'm afraid it's too far in and it's not worth protecting my email.

~!~Will the MCU be a phase where the X-Men are in hiding until they can get body armor more widespread?

Cybersai: I don't think this is an obvious answer, but I'm still curious. I understand that the X-Men are in hiding, but how many times would we need to start a Marvel cinematic war?
-----
Drewton: Yes. It is a phase that will be more localized.
-----

Geist: It's my understanding that "The next generation will be X-Men, X-Men, X-Men, X-Men, X-Men, X-Men, X-Men, X-Men" is not a new event.
-----
Mona: they're in hiding, but not for long
-----
Medalion: I think it'll come more easily, maybe with a soft reboot that focuses more on the X-Men mythos
-----
Slayven: I think they will get their comeuppance faster than the X-men.
-----
Kenzodielocke: No.
-----
Kuro: They'll be dead before they can save the world.
-----
Cream: I'd be more worried about the fallout with the new generation.

~!~I just got a new job but I think it's my fault

M52B28: So, I just got my first job as a lab tech for a big-ish company. I'm starting out as a lab tech as I'm not exactly what I'd call "highly qualified". It's a very big pay-top-5 position with a very aggressive salary cap and he expects me to do some specific work for him specifically.
My boss just told me today that he's cutting me because I "lost my position" on technicalities. I've been working in the tech field for about 15 years, and he's still cutting me. I'm the only one in the room that's been promoted, but by the end of the week he's cutting my pay. 
I'm pretty pissed, and I really, really hope this is my end. 
I just don't want to be the guy that calls me, "Hey, I lost your position" and says "I'm sorry I lost your job." 
I'm glad that's not the case anymore, but at the same time I'm not at all happy about it. 
Any feedback?
-----
M52B28: I've been telling my bosses that I'm not happy with my pay-level, and that I need to spend more time focusing on my job. 
I'm happy with the end result, so I don't know what to do.
-----
Jezze: Maybe you should try quitting to a new job?
-----
Dishwalla: what kind of responsibility is it to work for a new company if you think it's your own fault?
-----
Zoe: That's probably just part of the pay-level grumbling.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Just quit?
-----
Puck Beaverton: Sounds like there was a mistake.
-----
Puck Beaverton: It’s your fault.
-----
Buckle: Doesn't seem like your fault.
-----
M52B28: Absolutely.
My boss has been cutting me because of some stuff he does and does not like.
He used to do some things for me, but I don't think he did those exact things for me.
He's looking for a new job and I don't want to work for the company. He's my only reliable source for support here.

~!~Trump: I’ll take a shot at Japan later, should be treated like a first world country

Carnby: I'll never be friends with that dumbass, I'll never apologize to him, and I don't care about the poor people of that country.
-----
Inuhanyou: I'm sure Japan will treat him with respect and that's ok.
-----
signal: Maybe he's just really cheap on the tariffs?
-----
HStallion: He's such a dumbass
-----

ishan: Its not like he really has anything to say, just a few words.
-----
Slayven: He just trolling for attention
-----
Platy: I mean he has said that he does not plan to leave USA that soon
-----
TSSZNews: What a fucking idiot.

Muppet of a Man: He's making a really bad argument. He's said this before and this is the exact opposite.

~!~The future of japanese animation (Spoilers)

SigmasonicX: I was just thinking about this a lot and thought some of you may have all seen it already.
Japans work great as animation, but I'm not a fan of those art style choices. I think that's more of a soft "popping" style. I know that the japans in Cowboy Bebop are super goofy and funny, but they're not the best work. So I'm curious how many of you can give an okay answer and why?

SigmasonicX: Since we already have a thread on this:

~!~That said, I'm a big Star Wars fan, but there's a good excuse for all the memes about The Last Jedi with the recent addition of Rey's hair

MasterYoshi: I love the memes about the memes.
What are your favorite memes?
It's a good time to be a Star Wars fan, because I can't believe that the Jedi have been doing Rey hair for years, and it's finally time to shine a spotlight on it.
You can be as corny as you want, but there are so many good memes.
Here's the best of the memes I came across:
This is a great video, and I love the "Rey-oh!!" meme, but it's such a long meme to use in just one scene.
Here's one of my favorites:
What are your favorite Star Wars memes?
-----
shira: I think that's just too meta. 
Rey-oh is like the "Rey-oh Returns"
-----
rude: The "Rey-oh"
-----

John Kowalski: I don't know why I read memes as "shower puns," I just read them as "Rey-oh-telling."
-----
Cybersai: I'm a huge R2-D2 fan so I have a lot of good memes.
-----
CloudWolf: I'm not a huge fan of the "Rey-oh" meme as a whole, but I love all of the memes about Last Jedi.
I like the "Rey-oh-TIE Bomber"
Makes me sadder than the "R2-D2 Killer"

Cybersai: Another Star Wars thread?

signal: Article
The premise: An adult named Honey is living a 12-strong life with little-to-no resources to sustain him. Owner Honey is trying to survive by selling the dog and destroying his life. An abandoned pig and a chicken stand (are they not the same person?) give rise to a life of desperate dog living.

Dishwalla: Pretty good get for $100
-----
signal: $125,000 anyway.
-----
Cyclone: $125,000.
-----
Dullahan: Now is the chance to buy a puppy with a $2k budget?

Dishwalla: can't wait for the show to start

Jbourne: $125k and a puppy is a rare treat, but I'm down for a couple, they're pretty sweet.

Vonnegut: $125,000.

~!~‘The Majority Report’: The 5 biggest deaths of the century for Americans

WedgeX: The last time we had a thread like this, today we had yet another thread.
The majority report of the Century is here. As tragic as this is, it’s also not lost on Trump.
-----
Taki: I'm about to read this every day
-----
stew: So, are the results of the 2016 election what we had last time around?
-----

Taki: Not to mention that a third of Americans didn't vote.
-----
BronsonLee: That's terrifying
-----
Cochese: Thanks Obama.
-----
DrROBschiz: So what is going to happen? What is Trump going to do?
I mean, the main thing is that he is a white supremacist and he's already creeped out the family over that quadruple digits death among other things.
-----
Typhon: If I were a US citizen, I'd be calling for this report.
-----
HStallion: The Trump White House will have a meeting explaining this all over their next budget speech.

~!~Canada Mocks North Korea as 'It's Bullies' in Elections

.Detective.: ... yea.
-----
sgtnosboss: how the fuck does this fucking idiot get to do this much
-----
WrenchNinja: Canada is playing with the flames
-----
Maneil99: Mocks and prayers
-----
Xx 720: How dumb can you get?
-----
.Detective.: But Canada is obviously in the middle of nuclear war so couldn't they just hold out for peace talks?
-----
Volimar: How on earth is this non-news?
-----
.Detective.: A very typical North Korea tactic would be to complain that Canada is screwing over their own citizens.
-----
Heshinsi: I know North Korea has a problem with group of bullied kids, but they have bullied kids in the past so they probably feel the need to bully.
-----
Maneil99: North Korea has a lot of problems, the country has nuclear weapons. Most of those issues are solved by China and is just a matter of time. China isn’t going to be useful in North Korea either, they have to convince the US and Russia to stop their nuclear programme.

~!~Pitch your idea for a good movie

Liquid Plejades: Just finished watching The Disaster Artist, and holy shit. What a movie. The entire plot of the disaster movie is so dumb and the ending pretty much ruins it for me.
I started watching The Disaster Artist about a month after I finished the movie, and holy shit. 
The movie is a masterpiece. I'm glad the author is getting recognition for his work and that other people are getting recognition for their dumb ideas.
Anywho, feel free to suggest movies your folks have done before.

~!~Mike Shinoda's "The Lego Batman" is getting a new full series Blu-ray release

Scullibundo: Didn't see a thread.
-----
Saucycarpdog: Looks like a Lego movie limited series that came out last year?
-----
RatskyWatsky: I don't know how that would be possible - I'd love a full movie run of the studio that made Lego Ninjago. If they're going to do a little reboot on the franchise, I want the full series to come out.
-----
Slayven: Not even remotely a Lego movie
-----
Slayven: Welp, you know what to do
-----
TheGreatDirector: Looks like someone's seen the original.
-----
Detective Loki: This is going to be BO again.
-----
RatskyWatsky: For a week?
-----
henhowc: The Lego Batman anniversary movie came out this year. Looking forward to this.
-----
RatskyWatsky: That's what I was thinking, but I guess if you're going to do it in the style of the original Lego movie you better have a say in what they do with the rest of the series.

~!~If you were a black person, would you be okay with society depicting you as a black person?

TheGhost: I was thinking about this for a minute. I'm not a big fan of the term, that's fine. 
For example I don't like the term white privilege, that term just doesn't work. It's silly and it's racist. 
But if you were black, would you be okay with society depicting you as a black person?
-----
TheGhost: There's a word that comes to mind, but I don't think it should be used for this.
-----
Kraid: I wouldn't be okay with society depicting me as a black person. I'm not going to describe myself in anyway.
-----
TheGhost: I can't think of a person who would, in any situation, be considered white, but I would like that because it's what we have as a society.
-----
Admiral Woofington: I'm not a black person, but I think if it's just a white person's white friends, that's fine as long as it isn't a white power fantasy.
-----
Khanimus: I'm not black but I do think if it's a white person or even a black person they are white, that's fine.
It's a weird question though.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: i assume the word is black or black = black person, but i don't really think there should be any white friends at all
-----
TheGhost: That's a touchy subject aside, I think the term is overrated. I think it's overused to the point of unredefining someone's race, but that's no way to be sure, it's not like the people who are called black are necessarily the people who are white.
-----
verygooster: Did I read that wrong? I like black friends, but I don't really think it should be used for anyone.
-----
carlsojo: You're not one of them?

~!~What are your favourite live performances?

hibikase: Myself, I’m usually all over the internet showing performances. I’m usually all about the different musical tastes, I’ve loved a lot of them, I’m aware there are some big names out there, but I’d like to start with a couple, I’m very passionate about it.
I’m also incredibly tired of the “Live on Broadway” movement. It doesn’t work, the actors are terrible.
So what are your favourite live performances?
Here’s mine:
-----
Puck Beaverton: I like performances that kick my ass.
-----
Rvaan: I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's performance of Blood Meridian.
-----
HStallion: I've been dreaming about this for a few years now.
-----
dancingphlower: I have heard those ones that are just really, really good.
-----
THEVOID: I've been watching it for years, it's always really weird to me to watch.
-----
TheBeardedOne: My wife and I have two kids (2 other kids and a dog). We've watched a lot of the old shows, I haven't seen the new ones, and have seen a couple of the newer ones. My son is also a big fan, and just got off of a plane to see it here in Argentina.
I'm also really fond of Jimi Hendrix, but I don't really like his live performances.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I've been thinking about this on a whim ever since I saw the live version when it was on TV.
-----
HStallion: Hendrix was one of my favorite musicians ever. I was pretty disappointed after I heard the original Woodstock shows.
-----
Bernd Lauert: I don't know if it's my favourite, but I have a lot of respect for Jimi.
-----

====================
~!~"The Grand Tour" is my favorite comedy series of all time

Liquid Plejades: I remember when this show came out I was super into it. I didn't know that I had seen it at that point, and I had been avoiding it since. Then I had some competition give us some of my favorite comedies of all time, and I was hooked. 
But it never clicked with me, and I knew I had to see something different. It really was my first experience with a comedy series, and I was surprised at how funny it was. 
I didn't know how to word that properly, but I knew I had to see something different. The grand tour was just a really fun series. I am so glad I watched this one. Anyone else watch this show?
-----

====================
~!~Why is The Simpsons so highly regarded?

Star-Lord: I'm watching the Simpsons on Hulu right now and I'm reminded how much people are talking about how great the last seasons are. It's a special show and I'm not sure if it's as well regarded as other shows like Big Bang Theory or Sex Education.
-----
Mona: it's pretty good
not extremely well regarded either, but it is good
-----
Zoc: I find it highly successful and successful.
-----
KojiKnight: It's a good show and personally, I think it has the best season 2.
-----
Frump: It's one of the best shows (maybe) ever and has some of the best editing in TV history.
-----
Sinder: Simpsons is a masterpiece. I have a lot of episodes on YouTube but this is a great video if you want to learn more about the show.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's great, if overrated.
-----
HStallion: The magic of it is that it's so funny and hilarious at the same time. I remember being glued to the toilet when I was drunk.
-----
Wracu: I can't imagine how much people love it.
-----
Mona: i think it's super underrated, arguably the best animated show ever

~!~Buffy the Vampire Slayer is getting a Netflix series

Slayven: I was pretty sad to see the first season of Buffy but in many ways it is the Season 1 worth watching
-----
Wag: Hopefully it's good.
-----
Khanimus: I can't wait
-----
Galkinator: Hope this is good...
-----
ronaldthump: wait wtf?
-----
Slayven: I guess the show has almost half of the charm of Buffy.
-----
Dishwalla: So is this the end of the series then?
-----
Slayven: It is worth watching. The series was great and the show was pretty much like a personal best.
-----
BDS: I don't know, I love Buffy.

Tetra-Grammaton-Cleric: Hopefully, it's made better.

HStallion: I should really learn to love my dad cause he's my dad.

Hollywood Duo: I like my dad but I don't care about how much he's worth to me he'll still be my dad for life.

~!~Canadian public school system ‘shaping itself up’ with fake ‘dirt bombs’ to lure students in

.Detective.: I'm not Canadian, and I'm not quite sure how this is going to go down, and I have no knowledge of the extent of the issue.
Also, the article is from this year, not 2018.
-----
FriskyCanuck: That's really disappointing. We need to do better in this regard.
-----
BringBackSonics: I’m Canadian and I think the government has a responsibility to protect children from this type of indoctrination. This can be done literally anywhere, and the fact that it comes from a reputable source speaks volumes about that
-----
Buckle: So fake bombs is how they lure people in. The fact that they're telling people to use social media or facebook is just a demonstration of how far government indoctrination goes.
Fuck this shit.
-----
Bear: I was just told that the government had some kind of program that centred on online students.
-----
Oheao: I thought the same thing, but with the way schooloys were designed, it was going to be more like propaganda.
-----
Deleted member 11262: At least the government is working on some kind of strategy to push the idea that "techie schools" are bad, either.
I mean, it's real, but how can they believe it's going to actually happen and not some bullshit shills who go in front of public schools with fake fake shit bombs.
-----
Slayven: Sounds like a recruiting scheme for the CIA, huh?
-----
Prax: They are using this to lure over a million people into the workforce, that's a pretty good return on investment.
-----
Tregard: "Canada joins world leader Donald Trump-backed "School Of The Beast".

~!~The best part of watching a movie is actually finding out what the movie is about

NTGYK: Lol, this thread comes to you by the release of The Hateful Eight.
For me, the best part of watching a movie is finding out what the movie is about. I discovered out how this movie changed the way it inspired new movies. I remember the first time I saw a rap movie and being like "that's fucking awful." Or the first time I watched a movie and then realizing it was actually really good. (I'm an old man, I can't understand these things)
I also remember growing up with all these classic rock songs on repeat. (I know, TRON, I know, TRON)
So, what the hell do you think of The Hateful Eight?
And yes, I realize I'm a young adult, I'm just old. (I'm old)
-----
Kevers: It's the best movie ever made, the only movie I've seen in the year and a half it was just as good as the rest of the movie.
-----
Z-Beat: I think it's the best movie ever made.
After watching it I kind of want to go see it again.
-----
Fat4all: it’s the best bloody ash
-----
TheGreatDirector: I'm a young adult.
-----
Mona: Its a good film, but not the best
-----
Powdered Egg: I don't have a good answer for you but I'm a 20 somethings degree(!!!) and I'm not a fan of the movie. I'm a teenager, and I grew up with the classics.
-----

TheGreatDirector: That's what I'm saying.
