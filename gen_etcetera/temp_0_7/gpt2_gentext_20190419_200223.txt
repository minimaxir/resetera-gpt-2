~!~Can we talk about how awesome and/or awesomely catchy Death Grips' song is

AuthenticM: I can't think of any catchy Death Grips song that is without Death Grips' "I'm Still Here With It" single.
I'm not really a Death Grips fan, but I find the song pretty catchy.
What are your favorite "jokes" that are linked together? That's a good one.

Pop-O-Matic: The best one.

Cyanity: That's not Death Cab for Cutie, that's just the jist of that song.

~!~The Last Jedi is the greatest Star Wars movie of all time

MasterYoshi: That's an amazing statement by a director without ever directly directly scripting what's in the movie. He's a genius when it comes to directing great films, but he has no idea what he's writing when he makes a movie that actually understands the plot and world structure.
-----
Pelleas: I'm really surprised Lucasfilm has managed to land on that cliff-hanger so close to the premiere.
-----
Pilgrimzero: I’m going to guess it’ll be some old stormtrooper.
-----
Praxis: A++ is not the "best" SW movie, even amongst the OT.
-----
RustyNails: Will this be the best Star Wars movie?
-----
MasterYoshi: I would say it's the most recent Star Wars movie on the planet of Endor.
-----
Khanimus: No, it's not "the best" SW movie.
Just... not a good movie.
-----
Geist: It's a fantastic movie.

Mona: it's a lot of fun

~!~A day in the life of a young black woman

fireflame: As someone who was born in America, I find this story troubling and sad. I was born in America and watched her grow up and learn some things.
She was the youngest child of white immigrants in her family, her parents were immigrants. They were good people, but black. Her mom was of Mexican descent and their two daughters were born and raised in Florida.
Her younger sisters were born in the USA. Her mom was a college graduate and had a good job and a kid. Her own parents were immigrants who fled the USA at the same time, she work was from Califorile. Her younger sisters were born elsewhere in the world, they were immigrants who came to the USA as adults.
I have a friend who grew up in such a life story, she was still a teen and would go to many clubs and dances, she remember being a little girl when she was there and seeing her parents with her.
Somehow she grew up feeling like she was one of those poor white kids who couldn't even afford a good meal.
Her parents were immigrants, they came to the USA as adults. They didn't create food for her, she was born in the USA.
I believe this story is important to understand, I have seen this story on TV but I am afraid that it might help people to come to terms with their own internal struggles.

====================
~!~The Death of Stalin: The True Story of the Death of Stalin

MilesQ: Full Story - 
There is a lot to unpack here, so I won't ram in a TL;DR.
There's more in the link, but I'll just post my thoughts. I've got a lot of stuff to unpack, so if that's a good place to start.
I won't go into detail about the whole story so I'll just say that the basic gist of it is that a small group of folks have been trying to get info from Rodchenkov to take down the Communist Party of Russia.
Well, this is where I stand. Rodchenkov has a personal life. He's a lawyer in the Russian city who's parents are Russian, and Rodchenkov's parents are Russian. And his parents are all Russian, but Rodchenkov's mother is also Russian. And he's a Russian citizen.
His mother is also Russian. And if you visit a website in Russia, you will find that many of the people living on Rodchenkov's personal Facebook page are Russian.
This is very similar to the situation in the US, except the people who are on his FB account are also Russian. And they're friends with one another.
And, by the way, I'm not talking about political views. I'm not talking about political advertising, like it was in the US where I'm from and I'm not even related to Russia, but about the people who are on Rodchenkov's Facebook account are friends with one another.
I'm not talking about the fact that he's a Russian citizen, but about the fact that he is able to get info from his mother, his father, and from his entire social circle.
And (I'm not making this up) that he was able to get information from his father because he was both a Russian citizen and a Russian citizen living in Russia.
It's a pretty neat example of how close Russia is to the US/UK/AU/EU/whatever politically, but I'm not going to focus on all the details.
-----
Lonely1: I remember this making the rounds recently.
-----
Buddy: I remember when information was always prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively prohibitively tough.

~!~So... how do I get better at my job?

Cybersai: When I was in school I had a job title that was a job I was applying for. I worked as a lab tech for a company and I had a nice paying job. My boss was very happy with it so I accepted it. I was able to get a job offer in the 5 - 10 months. I just work as a lab tech and was able to get a lot of benefits. I'm 26 and I can't lose my benefits. How do I prepare for this job offer?
-----
Alcotholic: Apply to jobs like any other artist.
-----
How About No: Show your hustle
-----
Cybersai: There's really no excuse. My mom was a lab tech for a very good company. She was a very good person in her prime.
-----
Aselith: This is exactly what it looks like.
-----
jb1234: It's a part-time job. The pay isn't great and the work is generally pleasant, but I have a good paying job.
-----
MrChom: Pay is good, it's a "job". 
But don't try to "train" in any capacity. That's just bullshit.
-----
Alcotholic: Yeah. You know, this is the plot point in the movie Three Billboards Obamas...
-----
Borgnine: What is your field op?

Fat4all: no, they are buying loud
-----
Liquor: I live next to a neighbor that has the loudest fucking thing I've ever heard.
-----
Burt: Yes!
I've had to say that the best part of living next on the block is the few neighbors that come along. They're usually happy to hear the loudest shit around, and they're not going to turn the lights off for some reason.

Ingueferroque: Yes.

~!~So it’s about time for ResetEra to come clean about how their people are shills

Trojita: I can’t believe the man in the white shirt is part of a cult.

TheLostBigBoss: they are probably doing a fine job
-----
Fat4all: that looks like a terrible scene
-----
Coyote Starrk: Where the fuck is the fucker in this?
-----
Novoitus: so, in the other thread, some guy was talking about how the people that did this shit in the past were... "shills," and how a bunch of people who are all the same people, so to speak, are shills.
I'm just waiting to see what the response is so I can not be a shill until we know who these people are.
-----
porkproduct: Gotta understand your thread title is maybe not a title, but it's a title.
I don't think it's a good title, but I figure most people know who these people are.
-----
Imperfected: ResetEra is a shakedown of sorts.
Don't really care what the story is supposed to be, so don't put much stock in it.
-----
Mendinso: I thought you meant that they're shills, and not the movie being a part of it. I can see you make a thread, but I'm not sure if you'd get the proper title.
-----
Fat4all: they are not shills

Kongroo: You're shilling the cult?

-----
Toxi: That's fucked up.

Kraid: I don't understand why this is a major enough issue to have a press conference. You've got to be a goddamn moron to want this sent to every faculty, let alone the faculties and staff of a large majority of institutions.
-----
jacob.armitage: Don't like the fact that this is a major issue?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: No, I don't.
-----
Medalion: Yeah, i've been very frustrated by the lack of focus on racism in this forum for years, its a very small slice of society. Its hard to root against the people that want this shit sent to every institution of every university.

Phrozenflame500: this seems like a terrible PR stunt... i mean the leftovers of this university will be sent to every dean, senior, and staff of the college.

sph3re: I was recently reminded of the Walking Dead threads by my friend who is one of the hosts. He was able to point me in the right direction when he said "I just watched this episode of The Simpsons and it was so bad it looked like a sitcom. Like the whole episode was just bad. Like it wasn't even funny."

~!~People who use Oranges instead of butter don't sound great

Zen: I've used Oranges a long time and have had the mildest experience ever. I know butter used to be a godsend but that butter is too buttery for me to handle. I can't even eat butter with my mouth in my mouth. I'll take butter Macadamia but I'll take butter or whatever anyway. It's such a weird pairing. If butter was buttery, then butter is buttery. But if you took an oranges slice and just ate it, then you're just eating / drinking butter. Delicious.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Not a fan
-----
xxracerxx: That's just a prank.
-----
porkproduct: I love butter.

Wackamole: Not a good substitute for butter.

Just eat whatever butter is on the menu.

They've been pushing back a lot lately on the Snyder/Perle film, and I guess that's changing with this one.
-----
Pachimari: This looks really good.

ReginOfFire: The movie is a bit ahead of schedule from the book and Snyder's other stuff, he will do a more faithful version. I hope they make the adaptation they want to make.

What exactly does the Florida shooting "show" to be wrong with the gun reform?

-----
DeltaRed: Frieza is the only one to defeat him.
-----

Slayven: If you think about it, Frieza was from the planet of death
-----
Funyarinpa: This is not the final answer. I'd say that Frieza is the only one to defeat him, but he has to train and win every fight to be considered truly strong.

TheMadTitan: Frieza won the fight because he's a master martial artist.
You're right.

~!~MacOS 10.14.3 or 10.13.3?

RoadHazard: What do you think, will it be in 10.13.3 or 10.14.3?
I've been on a Mac since the early 2000's, and I have a mac since the moment I wanted a PC. I was a child when I first heard about the iPod, and I am now more than an adult. I am a PC gamer now, and I don't know how to get any better.
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, since the previous 10.14.3 I was used to was significantly better than the current 10.14.3 I had for the longest time. 10.13.3 was also the one I upgraded from from to the Mac, so I guess I'm glad I'm not switching to a phone.
-----
RoadHazard: I'm not actually sure how it works for 10.14.3, but it's probably going to come with a lot of programs that are going to piss off everyone.
-----
WickedCobra03: I'm MacOS 10.14.3 and I don't really want to leave. I'm currently on the 10.13.3 transition that I was on before I got my Macbook, and I don't see myself switching back to an old OS. I just wish I didn't have to use the OS to install the programs.
-----
RoadHazard: That's fair, I just recently got a mac since I am still using a macbook for work and I can probably do with it what I want, but I'll give it a try.
-----
Nokterian: OS X 10.13.3 or 10.14.3 will be the one to ever come to my mind.
-----
RoadHazard: This is fair. I don't really want to leave. I just wish I didn't have to be so bothered with the programs.
-----
Nokterian: OS X 10.13.3 or 10.14.3 is what I will be waiting for.
-----
RoadHazard: I'm not sure that OS will do that, but if I install the programs I guess I could just reinstall them after they come out.

Raein: I'm not sure I've ever seen anything as terrible as this as a Korean restaurant. I'd have to give it a pass from some of my friends.
-----
Dr.Phibes: As someone who has visited South Korea, this is not surprising. My brother went to go to SK1 as well, and it's not too surprising how shitty and horrible it is.
-----
Wackamole: I'm not from the US, but I've been to SK. Usually it's a nice country, but as I've lived here, I never got along with everyone.
Do you have a breakdown of what's happening down there?
-----
Jtwo187: I've had good experiences with Koreans, this is more of a "good experience so far" and a "getting a good job".
Doesn't help that my wife is Korean and I have no friends to call on.
-----
Krejlooc: So... is Korean hermit crab, or something?
-----
AuthenticM: I don't think it's a factor of "how terrible it is"
I just think "Kore" is too broad a term.
-----
Krejlooc: I wasn't aware, but I think it's because we've been to SK a few times already, and we've never gotten along well. I'm not sure how bad it gets, but the fact that we're not friends in Korea makes it super hard to be friendly to Koreans.
-----
AuthenticM: That's what the article is about. How bad it gets and how good of a job does it get.
-----
Krejlooc: I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone as bad as these people as I've seen people from Japan and South Korea deal with Koreans in their everyday lives.

Wasn't a huge fan of the Kamehameha stuff but the animation was like a nightmare I'm afraid.

Lotus: I don't think I remember the show getting dubbed

~!~What is the best 5K HDR TV out there?

Slightconfuse: So I'm looking for a 4K HDR TV that I can watch movies and TV shows on, I've found the Sony UP970HK which is like $180 USD more and the LG UP970HK comes with a lot nicer picture and tv quality too. So what is your go to? Any recommendations I should look at for a 5K HDR TV?
Edit: I've read this is a better 4K TV than the UP970HK which I think is worth mentioning.
Edit2: Got some opinions from reviews which are really good.
Edit 3: Size thread
Edit 4: Thanks a bunch everyone who gave me feedback.
-----
CloseTalker: I'll have to look into this, but there's a lot of 4K HDR content on Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Vudu, so I'd love to see that trend continue.
-----
vulva: It's the HDR 4K TV. The 4K DV Netflix stuff is amazing, especially for the price.
-----
CloseTalker: Same. Same.
-----
StrangeLuke: The HDR TV vs OLED is a good comparison. Those both offer the same benefits, but the HDR offers the advantage of having a really good picture and a very good display. 
A 4K SVR would have to offer the same problems to gain the 5K HDR standard.
-----
vulva: No, I don't have a 4K TV but I do have an OLED so I'm sure I'm just getting a good picture but I don't think I can notice the difference.
-----
Chojin: It only has HDR for a few hours.
4K is going to be more expensive.
-----
signal: It's a neat idea but HDR is the future and it's only a few feet away from 4K.
-----
vulva: That's what I'm debating. I'm considering the LG UP970 which is like the best 4K tv available but I'm planning on buying the UP970X which is about the same but TV is cheaper and it's cheaper than either the UP970 or the UP970X at 4K.
-----
Chojin: Well I'm not buying from a brand like LG. Maybe I should look into the 4K Blu-ray spec.

~!~This is the worst half of the year, Logan Paul

Daffy Duck: So I've just watched Logan Paul, a comedy show on Netflix that was just announced for being out on Netflix in a few weeks.
I'm a huge fan of the show but didn't get to see it in theaters. Did I overlook something? Or am I just a sucker for bad movies that don't need to be made for me?
Anyways, I'm maybe halfway through watching this, and it just feels...off? I've never seen a show like this in my life. The characters are just enough to be on the same level as when it was released, but now it's so different that I can't fully process it. I mean, I figured I'd be getting a pass from this, but I've never seen anything like it.
Anyone else just feel like something is missing?
-----
shira: I saw this trailer on Netflix. Wasn't a terrible trailer but I didn't expect to see this at the fucking latest.
-----
DECK’ARD: I've never seen this. It's the worst half of the year.
-----
Powdered Egg: This year? It's so bad that I'm not sure I want to watch it.
-----
Whitemex: I watched this last year. It sucked but the comedic acting was pretty great. I need to see it again
-----
shaneo632: Pretty much. That trailer was really bad.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I'm not feeling it, but I've never seen this kind of show. I watched it a few years back and the cinematography was pretty much the only improvement.
-----
Daffy Duck: Yeah I was just going to post that. I'll have to give it another go though for it to not be as bad as the first half.

UnpopularBlargh: I'm not feeling it, but I've seen a few episodes of the show. Not what you're looking for.

~!~Aquaman is a cultural milestone

BreezyLimbo: I've been waiting years for this. I know the first 2 movies were pretty good, but this is the first movie I watched in over a decade, and even though they're not the same movie, I feel like I've seen bigger fish than these movies. 
I'm not a big movie buff, but I can't help but to feel a lot of love for this film.
I'm a HUGE fan of the Aquaman films, and this is the first film I watched in an theatrical format, so I'm a pretty huge fan too. 
I'm looking forward to the 2nd film, but I wonder what other media they'll do it with. Aquaman will be the best live action film of all time, so probably it's the second Aquaman film. 
What are your thoughts on Aquaman?
-----
Emobacca: I think it is a great movie
-----
Mendinso: The first two movies are amazing. I don't know why anyone even cared about the second.
-----
Tace: Aquaman is the best live action Marvel film! One of the best, if not the best.
-----
BreezyLimbo: I know it's a little early to call it a masterpiece, but it is a very good film
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I think it's the best DC film, one of the best or has had one, easily.
-----
BreezyLimbo: It's all a bit of a mess and it's probably due to the terrible DCEU. But I don't think it's a mess and that I'm just one of those people who is still waiting for the studio to get their shit together.
-----
Slime: I don't know why audiences even cared enough to see the first two films.
-----
Emobacca: I don’t think so. The first two are amazing
-----
LookAtMeGo: The first movie is all I remember.

~!~Is it possible to get burned out on movies/TV shows/movies but still enjoy it?

King of Dreamland: I'm in my mid 30's, the end of May or the beginning of June. I don't really watch a lot of tv/movies or movies, but I've just started to go to a Walmart and there's a new show on the CRTC for the dollar and I'm looking for it. I do like the series, I guess. I do still have to catch up on stuff I haven't seen yet.
I'm looking for something new (I guess it has to be the new show on Mystery Science Theater 3000). I like it, I don't really hate it, but I really like it. I think I'll watch it from the start with a friend.
I'm a big Star Wars fan, I think it's one of the most impressive films I've seen, and I've seen it in the theater myself (starting with the prequel trilogy). It's not something that I could watch in theaters again in the next five or ten years, but I'm open to whatever new show comes out I want to try.
I've heard good things about the movie you're interested in? I'm not trying to be a snob, just really wanting something new. I've seen the first 3 movies in the last year and I'm not really a fan of the 3rd one.
-----
Fulminator: I doubt that, especially compared to what was released before it. I think it's a decent TV movie, but it's not a high art masterpiece.
-----
SieteBlanco: I'm willing to give money to Netflix if it's something right. It's a good film with a great cast and amazing visuals.
-----
King of Dreamland: I have no doubt that it will be better than the prequel trilogy alone.
I had to watch the original Star Wars trilogy way too many times to count them all as high art.
-----
Tobor: I can’t help but think it’s a quality movie. It’s not a masterpiece. I’m not a fan of the original trilogy or the visuals.
-----
Zeyphersan: It’s a good movie and (for a while) a must watch for fans of the franchise.

~!~Do You Know The Bizarre Clues You've Discovered?

RedMercury: This is my thread right now, but I'm just mentioning what I know to be certain because it's been something I've been thinking about a lot lately. I've been listening to a lot of weird stuff lately and I'm curious about the weird things that are just a few of them. I have a good list of things I know, but I'm kind of burnt out on them.
Let's say I'm feeling a bit of everything, is there something that's more universal? (I'm not saying I'm asking for explanations or anything like that)
-----
Birdseye: Not really, I don't get it
-----
EchoChamber: People saying the same thing to me.
-----
Plywood: I just checked the same thing. I don't remember the exact mechanism as I remember it, but all the same parts, like the way the air in the house does the sound, the way the ambient air plays music, and the time period.
-----
Red XIII: when i was a kid, i always thought it was a thing but now i'm convinced it's a really common thing.
-----
Redhead On Moped: I once discovered a completely unknown piano I owned. I was in my bedroom scratching it as it swayed, and I happened to be scratching at some of it. It was a piece of classical music and it was in some random order at the same time, so I was scratching it back. I found a tiny piece of it next to my room in a random room. I thought, OH GOD I KNOW THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING. 
Yeah, one day I decided to get a piano instrument and I decided I was going to get it at some point, but I ended up taking it to a local antique and the whole thing blew my mind, lol
-----
Yossarian: I’ve got a blank piano in my garage. I know it's a thing, but I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or not. I’ve bought a few, but I googled, but I remember finding some very interesting.

~!~What Are The Best First Time You Have Been To A Gala?

Andrew Korenchkin: I've been thinking about it lately. I've been meaning to go to an asparagus festival in a while. Been there a lot, but I've only been to 2 last year. I've been to 2 festivals I haven't seen in forever. 
The second one I was going to was in December, but I've been pretty much in the mid-late 90's for years, so it was a little after my 20's. I haven't seen anything by the 2nd one, but I'm wondering if it's even worth going.
-----
dietpepsi: I go once a month.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I haven't been to a proper one, but I love the ones I've been to. I'll eat a bunch of them.
-----
Fat4all: i go once every month
thanks for the reminder, i just recently got into Gala last weekend
-----
Fat4all: i usually go twice a month
the first time was in october, though i can’t remember exactly
-----
Dice: I go once a week for a year. I go for anything non-traditional, for a gala. Gala is a little more intimate than a festival, but it's fun, and the food is great. I've been to a few more, but not in the same kind of place or the same style.
-----
Fat4all: i went once a month
-----
Titik: I'm from Portugal, I've been to 3 festivals in Spain. The Gala is much more romantic than a festival, but there are some great food. If you want to go to some good eats, go to some bars.
-----
Titik: I've been to a few in the past, but those sucked. I would like to go to some more but OP is so good at Gala, it's only 9 days and I can't think of anything more.

~!~I just watched the first 15 minutes of The Last Jedi and I'm more speechless than I have ever been.

Deleted member 1258: This has been bugging me lately. I've never seen anything like this in the Star Wars saga. It reticates my heart that I'm writing this thread, but I don't know if it's worth sharing. 
I watched TLJ last night and I can't stop. I don't want to say this to anyone, but I'm also ten minutes into this. It's so much better than anything I've seen in the past. It's more coherent, it feels like I'm following a story, and the pacing and sound design is so much better than it has any right to be. It doesn't overstay its welcome, but it's still very much fresh and engaging. 
I know it's cliche, but I can't help but think that this is the first time I've truly experienced what a Star Wars fan can become. It's obviously not for everybody, but I'm still very excited for what this is once everything is over. 
Share your thoughts, what are your favorite moments from the film, and please no inflammatory remarks.

Hobbesian Thudercat: I've always wanted to get into Marvel Movies. The new Avengers, the new Captain America, the new Avengers 2 and I've got a whole bunch of other movies that I want to watch. But the problem is, I don't have a connection to the internet, and it's not very good.
And I can't seem to find a streaming option that's both correct and free.
How do I get one?
-----
Yerba_Sutra: I dunno, I think I'd just try Hulu (not due to how big they are)

console lover: Netflix I think? I have a pretty decent connection to the internet, but I'd struggle to watch the stuff on there if I could only watch the first couple of movies on there
I'm currently on a 50/50/100/whatever guide to cinema that's been turning ppl off for years, so I'd love to rectify that, but I don't know how much I'd be able to do without a dedicated player

Hobbesian Thudercat: I wouldn't mind, but that's what I'm doing. I'm going to watch them on a loop, and I'm curious to see what the best way is. I guess I have more than enough free time to watch them, but I'm really just looking for something that's relatively fresh in my mind.

~!~Any ideas?

Wag: I've always dreamed of becoming an actor or a director and I'm going in my first ever Q&A at a film festival. I'll post some excerpts later.
I am 5'7" (room average between 200-210 lbs) and started working on my acting chops at age 17. I was excellent in older movies and had a few good roles in the last decade. Long hair and beard is not my bag
I know it's "cool" to be a director or actor, but I'm not desensitised to it. And I'm not complaining.
I've tried to figure out a way to show off my acting chops that might appeal to the general public. I've asked people on ERA before. I've read some of the clues for clues. I've been doing this for years and have found the scene where I get my hair looks like this:
It's a long shot so I wanted to try to be as relatable as I can with it.
And I'm not complaining. There's a lot of ways to look and film for movies. I'm not black. I'm mostly familiar with actors and their various styles (from actors that have never appeared on screen to actors that have appeared on screen and have a bae). You can find actors that will look like a rock or a hard 70's football game.
I'm not complaining about you getting your hair done. This is just trying to be relatable to society and what it does to people. I'm just curious on what other people are trying to do.
-----
ManaByte: You're looking for a movie with a very accessible story telling mechanism.
-----
AlteredBeast: It's definitely the way to go, but it'll be harder to find actors that are good for it.
-----
Seductivpancakes: I have a hairline that I know nothing about and have been honing my ottoman skills for the past few years. I used to make a game but I'm only a game now, so I don't know the best way to get it down.

~!~My Issue with the "Romans, Christians, and the American Education System"

StuBurns: I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I've come to the conclusion that the "argument" or "consequences" argument is lazy, useless, and often harmful. As a Christian, I don't believe in absolution or the power of the gospel to bring about salvation, but I do believe in faith, forgiveness, and forgiveness. 
I've been forced into taking that position because of my own personal experiences, family and friends, and general conservative ideas about American culture and education. I'm not even talking about the Christian defense of the father or authority of Jesus, which is something that is not really a thing anymore. I believe the gospel is more applicable to today, because it is more accessible, and allows people to practice their faith better. 
But I've also been hearing about the "arguem" or "argvats" argument, and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. I think it diminishes the seriousness of the issue, and I think the "argument" is really lazy, useless, and often harmful. I think the "arguem" is really just that, that if you think "God doesn't give a shit about what I do and don't happen to do", you are unworthy and a failure for being in the position.
I think the "arguem" is much more important in the context of my own personal experience. I grew up in a conservative household, and I know that it is often hard for me, and my parents, to approach the issue. 
My issue with the "arguem" is that I don't believe in any of the concepts of grace and separation. The idea that there is no grace is often brought up by people who have no concept of it. The idea that there is no grace is often brought up by people who have no concept of it. Grace and separation are brought up by people who have no concept of it.
-----
Rektash: The idea that God doesn't give a shit about what you do and that He loves you, also, isn't really helpful. I think this is where the "debate" might begin, and it is pretty clear that we (if your parents ever spoke about this, and it was just your parents) don't really understand the concept either. I think

~!~What is the best way to watch the Walking Dead?

Oheao: So, I've recently started watching the show. Since the last season, I've watched:
- all the episodes of season 6
- several seasons of the show, plus all the last season of season 7
- most of the season 7 episodes (which I have not seen)
- the first season of the show
I've got to say that I'm quite happy with how the show seems to be going these days. I'm rather happy with the season 7 episodes:
- "The Death of Julius Caesar"
- "The Rise of Alphonzo"
- "The Siege of Jerusalem"
So, in short, I love the show, it is one of the best shows ever made, but I'm curious what Era thinks is the best way to watch it? I'm personally not a fan of any of the standard "grey" filming styles: high resolution, high resolution with lots of colors and looks, like the Walking Dead remasters themselves. I'm also not a fan of the constant melodrama, the show is too melodramatic for grown adults to understand.
-----
CrazyDude: Odd show.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I mean, the fact that it is a Grey is like, the fucking norm.
-----
cj_iwakura: I was just watching the whole season for the last time I saw it. This is the first time I've seen it since I was a kid and it was not at all what I remember.
-----
MisterHero: I'd say the best way to watch it is to go to a store and pick up a random box. I think the tapes are what have you.
-----
Oheao: I don't think I've seen the series since the first season, but I can't think of any show I'd say is "so" out there.
-----
Travo: I don’t know if you’re a fan of Grey or not.
-----
Powdered Egg: Grey
-----
GiantEnemyCrab: The fact they ran out of "Blood" is what broke me. It's not a show about zombies, it's a show about a 14th century battle a battle for survival and the survival of a people.

~!~New York's Central Park has the weirdest "friends only" boardgame

Dodongo: This is the weirdest "friends only" game I've ever seen. It's pretty fucking weird. I'm not an expert in any of it, but I can assure you that it's fucking awesome. It's a board game where you have a group of 4 to 6 girls and one of them starts with a big die or whatever and then has the whole group die and come back from the dead. I've never seen anything like it before, but it's funny because the game is so played that you have to learn to play it well beforehand. It's also a fun way to get more inexperienced players who want to learn the rules, but are intimidated by group dynamics because they're afraid to do it right away. I've never played it myself, but I don't remember it being so...eh...old.

Nexus: I mean, I'm sure the most cynical generation of the last century is gonna be Gen Z, but... let's do a little research and see if Millenials are the worst generation of the 2000s.
Millennials are a kids generation. They don't grow up in a bubble economy, they grow by using the stock market, and they represent a massive chunk of the kids of today.
They're also a generation of social assholes who don't get their shit sorted till their 20s.
What do you think is the worst generation of the decade?

hjort: Very likely this is a problem with the material. Teflon wool, which is woven through dense mesh, is known to have antiseason properties.
I'd recommend wearing regular socks. Teflon will stick out where it belongs. The wool will cling to a very small area if pressed up against a hard surface. (I wear velvety underwear, for example).

~!~Post-apocalyptic series starring the likes of John Carpenter, *RED volume 1

JehutyRunner: I've been thinking of making the thread for a while but eventually I came across the concept behind this comic called 'The West Wing' starring Carpenter and Tom Cruise as a post apocalyptic Los Angeles. It's basically something to H.P Lovecraft themed sci-fi but with a lot of the tropes from the Old West being brought over since the 70s.
I've never heard of this book until now, but looking it's really good looking so far. It's not out on any platform yet so whatever you do, burn it. I'd love some suggestions for other ideas.

Ok I'll try that out
-----
Megalosaro: I play piano and guitar, my wife is a teacher, and I just want to try it. That being said, I've never been able to do it because I've never bought the piano myself.
-----
Elynn: I play piano, guitar and guitar.
I'm not really a good pianist. I can play fairly well enough on my own, but I'm not a super great player in general.
I can't play anything well enough to exhaustively prove that you can play some decent beginner songs clean.
Learn non-sport shit like gunna and the like

~!~Alien movies are a whole other story

Deleted member 1258: So I watched Alien Home Movies and as soon as I watched Alien, I saw it as a whole sequel.
I'm getting mixed feelings from reviews. I think it looks way better than the original, that it's great, and that it's dumb fun.
Obviously, I've seen these movies numerous times since and have never had a problem with it. I've gotten burned out by the whole "original" feel. I prefer the Alien franchise to the Aliens sequels, and I've never seen the original, but I thought the first one was a lot better than the Alien itself.
Have I been burned out by the original, or have any of the movies been bad?
-----
Rhaknar: go watch Alien w/ the first one, it's great!
-----
Dook's Revenge: Maybe you have the wrong impression of it?
-----
Aurelius: I watched the original. It's just different.
-----
Doggg: It's kinda the same, isn't it?
-----
ShadowSwordmaster: The Alien franchise is where it's at.
-----
Bramblebutt: The first one is great. The sequel is dumb, but it's got some good concepts, and some excellent visuals.
-----
RDreamer: The first one is meh. The second one is brilliant. I’m hoping the third one is as good.
-----
TheFurizzlyBear: The first one is awesome and I thought it was very similar to the Aliens first movie, which I never saw. 
It was good. But it didn't come close to Alien I think. 
But yeah, it's more like the original than the Alien film.
-----
Dusktildawn48: It was the best one I watched. It was a good movie.

~!~Netflix's The Christmas Chronicles Announced for Season 5

BrokenFiction: Title: Written by Craig McCracken, co-written by Sean Bean, directed by Taissa Manley, starring Amy Ryan, Amy Adams, Molly Jett and Carey Mulligan.
The last of the original 12 season series will be done up this year.
I hope this means it'll be at least a little lighter in tone, rather than a cartoony melodrama.
-----
Einchy: And now it's a Christmas movie.
-----
Tagg: I am so fucking down for this.
-----
Eidan: That's actually not a Christmas movie, that's some straight-up-christmas-movie-esque type of bullshit.
-----
chefbags: I thought this was about a Christian movie.. lol
-----
BWoog: Yessssss, I'd rather see Christmas movies do light things.
-----
BDS: Not a Christmas movie, that's just some lighthearted christmas movies.
-----
LionPride: I'm soooooo glad the series is getting lighthearted again so it can be a little darker
-----
Tagg: I mean, it's a Christmas movie. It's probably a little more "joke" in places than a real Christmas movie, which I'd imagine would be a fair way to go.
-----
cervanky: I’m very excited for this.

~!~The Verge: UK-based burger chain Impossible to debut "Half Pint" burger

chadskin: Via The Verge:
-----
Dennis8K: Will this be available at supermarkets in the UK soon?
-----
mrtl: I want half pint but I don't know how much it will cost.
-----
Fliesen: The taste may vary, but there's no harm in trying another brand if you're not at least half-way decent at their food.
-----
DorkLord54: The taste may have been a bit less noticeable recently, but I'd still take a double double and a half out of a double burger.
-----
FeenixRisen: I don’t care if it tastes like shit.
-----
Yerba_Sutra: Damn that's a really good deal
-----
Jbourne: I'm still not over processed food, but I'll be sure to give it a try.
-----
Dook's Revenge: There's a half-pint burger?
-----
MochaKoffee: I can't imagine eating half a pint of half-pint is going to be a bad experience.

~!~Jared Leto on 'The Man Who Killed Don Johnson'

WrenchNinja: 
-----
Dook's Revenge: He's a good actor, but the whole 'Hitler is a racist' thing was racist.
-----
LionPride: Plot twist ...Hitler's son is a murderer
-----
Grizzel Greedigut: This guy is a real piece of shit.
-----
Aselith: lol we're getting a movie
-----
Slayven: I thought the two biggest reasons not to have the Hitler in the Batman films was racism?
-----
Grizzel Greedigut: Killing of a Sacred Deer was the number one reason not to have the Hitler in the Batman films.
-----
HStallion: Wasn't there a joke that Hitler's son was Russian and it turning out to be a story he was hallucinating?
-----
MisterHero: I thought the son was Hitler
Hitler was a murderer? Who?
-----
cj_iwakura: Also, I really enjoyed the movie, but I can't think of a single reason it was racist.
-----

====================
~!~Is there any character in Dragon Ball who has remained fairly bland throughout the whole ordeal?

PSqueak: The movie that i remember the most are the Frieza saga, but then again the rest of the movie isnt great either.
The movies that i remember are
Leader of Frieza's team
Team Madrin
Team Blue
Team Rocket
Team Ultra
Team Yamcha
Not sure if these are canon, but a lot of these characters are really bland in comparison to their earlier movies.
-----
Kyougar: Goku.
-----

PSqueak: I think Yamcha in particular is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine, because he had a lot of themes that i felt resonated with me.
He's been covered in that orange soup look, like a lot of people, but he was a character you had to think about.
-----
Dale Copper: Goku's first Frieza was very early on a bad note, so it's not quite as bad as it should have been.
Team Madrin and Frieza's first fight was entertaining but not as good as it should have been.
-----
Silfer: Goku's first fight. I actually really like the first fight and I’m sure it was the worst fight in all of Dragon Ball.
Team Madrin is second to none in my memory and I’m sure it was just a shitshow.
Team Yamcha is all we have so far.
-----
Kakurai: Yamcha. He's just too good for this world.
-----
Kongroo: Team Rocket
-----
Powdered Egg: Goku, actually.
-----
Chivalry: Team Madrin (Korean Goku).

~!~The Best Episode of a TV Show

mrtastee: As I'm watching my first season of a new show I'm looking to watch again, What the Flop? I'm not a huge fan of the first two episodes, but I've been enjoying the first few seasons. Just finished Season 1 and absolutely loved every second episode.
Easily my favorite. It was a fun ride, and I'll definitely remember going in knowing exactly who my character was.
What the Flop?
-----

MrChom: It's pretty solid, but it's definitely not the best.
-----
jsnepo: I like the episode where he goes "AHHH, PUMPED!"
-----
sph3re: It's definitely the best :D
-----
Mortemis: It’s different but the two episodes that build up to it are definitely the best. 
“Powdered Marge” is one of my favorite writing scenes in TV.
-----

Mushroomer25: I always thought the same thing.
-----

mrtastee: Yeah the episode where they decide to give him a haircut is one of my favorite scenes in TV.
-----

~!~Amsterdam is amazing - looks like a beautiful city full of life....

thepenguin11: I love me some vibrant colours and a great night life.
There is also a whole other awesome touristy part of the city called the 'Amsterdam Cafe', there is a bar called the porter with a huge projection screen on it.
It's also an amazing area with a lot of flowers and nature. There is also a park called the eees in the centre of the city so you can get a lot of views.
The city itself is cool. It's a beautiful city, have fun in Amsterdam or visit another city.
-----
Grimminski: I like to laugh.
-----
Tence: Yeah, this is true. I like meh.
-----
Banzai: I'm a London person, but I love Amsterdam.
You can wander around the city on foot and see all the major tourist attractions, such as Eindhoven.
Good times for finding other fun things to do? Yes, but not in the sense that it's not completely crazy crazy. It's more fun than living in a city full of crazy people, though.
-----
johan: I definitely understand why this is so popular in the Netherlands, but I think I could go to Amsterdam for a week and see a lot more than that.
-----
VeePs: The Dutch are not as great as the English. Amsterdam is like a different kind of English. The English are also not as talented and fun. Just a few words about the English
-----
Blue Sky Noise: I'd like some Amsterdam
-----
EasyRoad: I think the city is great. It's the most funable city in the Netherlands with the best places to go in the world for a tourist, and overall it's a beautiful city in general. 
It's a little expensive to go to Amsterdam, but it's definitely worth it if you're interested in finding things. There are a lot of 'cave cities' around Amsterdam though, there's nothing like them.
-----
Hollywood Duo: I’m going to Amsterdam for 9 days with my friend. I’ll be there for 2 days but I’ll definitely be entertained.
-----
nib95: I'm gonna be impressed, I suppose. I need to plan somewhere to rest before going.

====================
~!~The Bill of Rights (Preceded by Rev’s In Sacred Traces)

Piecake: So, if you’ve never read the Bill of Rights, this is exactly what it is: a timeless text that depicts Western philosophy as an illusory and illusifiable world. As such, it shares the same core themes of Western philosophy as Coursera's Foundations of Geometry, and it is thus the earliest authoritative work on the subject.
It is a treatise on natural numbers and the free market, and is largely indebted to Pre-World economy. It is also a valuable collection of essays on the efficacy of the U.S. method of measurement (e.g. Foundations of Geometry).
-----
Piecake: Also, I don't know if this is actually a thing yet, but I'm going to guess that the British economist Henry Jackson, a co-founder of that university, wrote an essay on the relation of central points to the development of Western economy in the late 19th century.
-----

====================
~!~Is there a good way to watch the Honey Badger?

Hollywood Duo: Just started watching the Honey Badger a few days ago and holy shit this thing is amazing. Just watched the first and second, it's just so bizarre. It's a classic and just completely nuts. It's a classic film.
-----
RatskyWatsky: What was the last movie you watched?
-----

Mona: yeah right now im in the mood for a good Honey Badger watch
-----
Ozzy Onya A2Z: That is a really good one.
-----
Dennis8K: I love this one.
-----
Mona: yes
-----
Hollywood Duo: I watched it two days ago.
-----
Fancy Clown: Yes, it’s kind of a necessity. Toni Collette just goes at it hard enough. I’d also love to rewatch it again in 4K HDR.
-----
RatskyWatsky: It's a good one, but it may not last as well as the last two.

~!~NYT: Facebook’s data breach: Big data not only exposed employee, we warned Facebook’s board members

BAD: 
-----
Kernel: What was the breakdown of what’s normal in this hyper passive aggressive society?
-----
Kthulhu: Pretty shitty of a company to put up with this bullshit.
-----
Kthulhu: I feel like this is something like a Ulysses S Grant situation where the company is being shown the way.
-----
Daitokuji: And here I was under the belief that it's that you've got to be a terrible person to do this kind of stuff.
-----
dietpepsi: I mean, I say it's like the John Oliver case where the company is so malicious and knows exactly the kind of terrorist that will be using your information for their own purposes.
-----
Kthulhu: That is what I was afraid of.
I mean, it's not like it was malicious intentions. It's just a collection of numbers.
-----
Radiophonic: I’m a lawyer in the US and I’ve been saying for years that this is exactly what the government wants you to think. But Facebook is a very large company with a very big following around the world. Its users are very large, and their data is very private. And they’re going to use it to make decisions that affect millions of users in the end.
-----
tuxfool: You have to be a terrible person to do this. You can't trust a company that is admitting to having thousands of staff members doing this sort of work for free and to make it free for the users.
-----
Kthulhu: I mean, it's a collection of numbers. You can't just say that.
I'm not sure they are admitting that. "It's not just a collection of numbers." They're admitting that they have thousands of people working on this work while millions of people working on this work also work on facebook.

BWoog: Man I, I could totally see Spider-Man being in a year line this year.

-----
Slayven: That was a bad pun.
-----
BWoog: It's the first time I've ever heard that joke in comics.
-----
TheGreatDirector: I can understand where the jokes are coming from, but he did a good job translating them.
-----
Slayven: Maybe not the first time
-----
BWoog: The jokes are making it real.
-----
ZattMurdock: I'm going to be having a good year.

Slayven: And he said he was going to make a new one.

Marcellus Wallace: I should've elaborated a bit more. I believe I'm an idiot and the whole "I am not a child" thing is a bizarre, strange yet effective satirical moment.
-----
hydrophilic attack: this is exactly what I was thinking
I have no idea what the reaction would be to I am not a child being used as an insult
-----
Coyote Starrk: These are some really funny memes. 
That song that plays when a kid does the most dumb thing in the silliest way possible is my shit.
-----
Beartruck: I don't know what the reaction would be, but that song is fucking hilarious.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: That cartoon is so dumb.

fireflame: I want to know what are the trends in people posting in the porn thread. I tried googling but it seems there are many people who post in the OT and I don't know what to tell you. I saw a thread about people going on a walk around their town to "get high", this thread has 60+ posters, I have to wonder what are the usual patterns and trends.
-----
RoadHazard: That's bizarre.
-----
Shao Kahn: Just admit there's a lot of trolls on that forum, OP.
-----
Mona: its really not that weird
songs are really played to get high
-----
Puck Beaverton: It’s the same
-----
Goldenroad: I'm not sure what the OP is talking about. I mean, I've seen high-key prostitutes, and I've seen prostitutes in porn for a while.
-----
Dishwalla: the poster for pornhub recently said there's a massive surge in people that post in the porn thread.
-----
Sectorseven: Porn is terrible, but the OP is pretty well organized.
-----
mrtastee: People want to get high, not to get high, just like any movement of people going on about how we should all be happy to masturbate.
-----
Douche McBaggins The 4th: Sex is a hobby. Its just gross and wrong to post sexily.

Thewonandonly: We all know that beer and food is one of the top go to things nowadays. But what about those other popular beers that taste bitter and nasty but still edible or ones that taste good on their own? Also I am curious to hear what you think the best beer and cheese are.
-----
Kongroo: Probably Stouts.
-----
Lonewulfeus: Belgian Blonde?
-----
hombremalo: Guinness
-----
Thewonandonly: I don’t know that I’d say Stouts but I’d say the lassiest beer is lambickel hue
-----
SJRB: Keystone Cider
-----
Cochese: Belgian Wit, or White & Black.
-----
Cocolina: Guinness
-----
Torpedo Vegas: I can't decide what beer taste the best they are ever known for, but I'm not gonna lie I'm surprised when I'm told by friends and family that Coors makes some great beer.

Dennis8K: French Lazer.

~!~"The New Jim Crow" is a great movie

Daffy Duck: So I saw this movie a couple of hours ago, from my friends, and I couldn't believe it. It's not good at all, but it is very different from the old Jim crow. It's depressing, racist and entirely takes itself, it's a lesson in how to run your own fucking company. I can't believe I've never seen this in my life. It's not that I want to out myself in a movie, I've seen it a few times, it's that I've seen it in real life and I think it's a great movie.
Where is this movie going to get a widespread discussion of this? I've seen a couple of threads on this, but I'm not sure what to think. I've seen a couple of other threads, but I would have to make the most of this. I want the discussion to start about this movie, not in an attempt to make people upset about it, but just to have it not be offensive. I know we have a lot of Jim crow videos, but this one was so good it's amazing.
-----
Aselith: I think it has some really negative aspects to Jim crow, but it is just a movie, and you don't really see it in any other form.
-----
Daffy Duck: I mean, I think it's a great movie, but it's very different from the old Jim crow.
-----
Wackamole: I thought it was really good, but I loved it.
I have watched it a bunch since then and it feels a lot like old Jim crow.
-----
Aselith: Does it take you like the idea of writing a movie to make you angry?
-----
Aselith: I guess that makes it ok but I wouldn't want it to offend you.
-----
Poppy: jim cokes is a sex offender
-----
Aselith: It's okay if you don't want to offend you, you can just pretend as if it's not a movie and assume it's not directed at you.
-----
Mahonay: I love it. 
It's a good movie.
-----
Lidl: It's a great movie, and it's not a movie you are going to see as a criticism of the movie.
Also, don't get angry

~!~Best (and/or worst) anime visual for a tablet?

Deleted member 1258: This is a thread about the best and/or the worst anime visual for tablets and their apps, whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or the built in podcast reader.
What are the best and/or least worst visual effects for tablets? I'm curious to see what Era's opinion is.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: The openings for the background music are pretty bad.
-----
shenden: For TV, do not use anything except the TV app.
-----
Kino: Personally, I'd prefer a video. But the backgrounds for the background music are pretty good.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: Also, try not to use anything. That's not how tablet/mobile apps work, so it's not a recommendation, but a very specific thing.
-----
Somnid: The backgrounds for the right-angle shot in the Twitter thumbnail are pretty terrible in tablet mode.
-----

GrimGrinningGuy: The backgrounds for the side-by-side screenshots I’ve seen in the comments are perfect in tablet mode

~!~How do I implement this in my online video?

Mr. RPG: Hi everyone, I've seen a lot of people complain about how it's not exactly the same as what we're used to. It's also a bit different in how it works. 
I'm looking for a general online guide to this, so I'll ask some people who have done some quick googling to help. 
So, how do I implement this? I don't really know much about the site itself or how it works.
I'm looking for a general online guide to this. 
Thanks

xxracerxx: Do you have any kind of search feature? If you search for something like “video games” you can find a lot of good video guides. 
I’m just curious.

Mr. RPG: I'm looking for something that covers the basics of the three. Thanks!

~!~Neil Gaiman (Norse Mythology) adapting the Greek tragedies for real, and who else?

Masoyama: This is amazing. Gaiman himself has done real with a retelling of the myths, and the original Greek works in general, but this is really cool, and a lot more real than what we got before.
I think this is really awesome timing since his most recent book, The Wind, A Dream, and nothing else, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, came out last year.
-----
Dennis8K: I love Neil Gaiman.
-----
shnurgleton: I am not a huge fan of Gaiman himself, but I guess I need to read more of his stuff, especially his work on the Lord of the Rings.
-----
Masoyama: I have, in the past few years heard that the stories were adapted into live action by a German company, and that in some cases, they ended up actually making real things. I wonder if that is true for the books, as Gaiman himself is very popular.
-----
ClivePwned: Hope it's real.
-----
Nachos: I'll have to check it out. I've read the Greek stuff as well, and I'm interested in the stories and the historical background.
-----
Masoyama: I don't read much else. I love Greek and all, but I have read a fair amount of Greek Mythology.
-----
The Last Wizard: I want to read the Cumheads and the Sun's Children books but I need to read more Greek Mythology.
I've heard the mythos is a bit complicated to explain so I'm hoping some of you can help me out.

Dennis8K: I've read some of the other Greek Mythology books but not all.

~!~Zack Snyder's Plead Deal With Warner Bros. to Write/Perform DC's Flash Issue

Pachimari: A friend of mine sent me this article and I thought I might do a thread about it, as it's a really good one, and I'm not sure how it would apply to the situation at hand. I understand that DC and Marvel have contractual with each other, but with Flash, Zack Snyder's deal has to be up for a while, so it's up to the artist if they want to do the script.
What does this mean for Flash?
-----
Detective Loki: This is the perfect place to talk about Batman The Animated Series The Animated Show.
-----
Pachimari: So is it really "just" one issue?
-----
PaddingtonDidntDoIt: This is a dumb move.
There are better ways to do Batman..
-----
Pachimari: Yes, but it gives another creative team a more creative freedom, and hopefully gives them something to work with.
-----
Raguel: Wonder Woman will be better than the Dark Knight
-----
Pachimari: To be fair, that's the issue that the writer/artist intended. Hilarious.
-----
Lopez: I like Wonder Woman
-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: Huh? We're talking about a flash issue. Flashpoint could be a stand-alone issues or a sequel to a book.
That's just for stuff that isn't the show. Anything else, it's just a panel-heavy issue? Not that this is going to have any kind of meaningful impact on the series, but I like it.

~!~Movie and TV Scenes

Squarehard: What are some of the movies and TV scenes that are just simply simply "action" in the most convenient and least disturbing ways?
What are some memorable scenes from your favourite movies and shows?
Here are some of mine,
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'll admit, I enjoy watching movies as they are fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh. Action films are fun too, though I do enjoy sitting through a ridiculous amount of TV.
-----
Z-Beat: For whatever reason, I like to watch movies as they are fresh and fresh, not as good as the sequels that came before them.
-----
Kasai: I like to watch movies that I just want to enjoy, and not as bad as the sequels. 
My favorite thing in a movie, however, is James Cameron's The Abyss.
-----
Cocolina: Lot of porn
-----
Ryuelli: Going to give this one a look, I guess.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I like watching movies that have been around for a while.
-----
Squarehard: I noticed that there were some in the thread that were out for some time and were added later on.
My favorite one is probably The Bourne Identity, but I'm not sure if it's as good as other ones.
-----
Bramblebutt: I like watching movies in the theater.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I really like watching movies at home, but I don't trust myself to watch them properly.

DrROBschiz: I'm going to quote some examples since if I can get a thread running, lets start with the one that is currently running
-----
Razgriz417: I'm not Canadian and I'm not quite sure what that is but I think I remember when we had a thread going about how we had to explain our relationship with Canada in the past.
We probably shouldn't have let that go.
-----
Mest08: It's not just us, it's the whole population of America and the British Empire.
-----
John Dunbar: america has the right to keep and bear as well.
-----
_ifigured: Sounds like a good thing for the USA to me. Americans have a right to keep and bear as well as the right to life in America. There is no doubt in my mind who my family are and what my family would be like if they could be kept and carried out their responsibilities.
-----
Heshinsi: If you two want to know who exactly are Americans and British Empire?
-----
The Culture Vulture: I don't think we have a thread for that.
-----
DOT_mjo: Well I like this one.

Bramblebutt: I'm not Canadian and I don't know what that is either, but I'm also not American and I don't know if I'd consider that right as an American citizen.

~!~So this is the best trailer I've seen in a while.

Deleted member 1258: I'm sitting here watching this trailer, and a lady starts talking to me about how much she hates the movie and how we shouldn't talk about it.
And I love how the trailer is just as good as the real thing.
I thought I'd start laughing but this is the best I've seen.

xxracerxx: That's not the sleeping bag.

Paperboywriter: this is not far from the truth

Galkinator: I don't know why, but this is great.

Hollywood Duo: Looks like a movie that's getting a lot of play. I can't wait to see it

Mr.F: Loved it when it first came out, but I don't think I'll watch it now that I've seen it.
-----
Dalek: That’s not a movie I enjoyed when I was a young kid.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: That's not a movie I enjoyed when I was a teenager.
-----
Scullibundo: That’s not a movie you enjoy.
-----
NoblesseOblige: I was not a kid, I watched this movie on the plane and sat next to my parents in my 20s. I did not like it when I was a teenager. I think I still like it when I'm a young adult.

The perfect Dark: I don't have a definitive answer for this question, so let me try to keep it to film commentary..
He plays the lead on this ballad:
What's your favorite from his films?
-----

see5harp: The Killers. Right up there with The Presidents.
-----
Kapten: The best Kings of Leon.
-----
thekonamicode: He's the best King of Mice.

Kenzodielocke: He's also the guy who wrote some really good puns.

Wulfric: I'm looking for an Android/Sprint device for the AppleTV/iPad/iPhone X playlists.
I'm also interested in finding the music for the tracks that appear in the podcasts/streams we have on that platform. Please help me decide.
-----
Fat4all: i have a big selection of mumblecore, mumblecore 5, mumblecore 12, mumblecore 12 mini, and some of the bigger tracks like the mumblecore 200, mumblecore 500, and the really good mumblecore 11
-----
Wulfric: I know what you mean.

Fat4all: mumblecore 250
mumblecore 250

Souzetsu: mumblecore 500

Wulfric: Here you go.

Cantaim: Thanks for the suggestion. Got to search for mumblecore and this works for me too!

TheBeardedOne: I've been looking for something to watch lately, but I'm not sure I have the right music to go with it. I tried Spotify, Apple Music, Stitcher and my recommendations didn't seem to work.
I know there's a Thundercloud account that works for free, but I'm not sure if it's really worth the subscription cost.

Fat4all: you can do a DD playlist, but it's not actually super music wise

Sami: Theres a chance this will backfire. I feel like its not even worth trying anymore.

Rover: Expecting a Russia-fucked Manafort the Mueller investigation would implicate the entire world's government in one slip of the tongue.

~!~The Death of Empire by Seth Dickinson

SigmasonicX: Released November 11th, 2016, the final piece in the Complete Dead Avengers trilogy.
It's a really long video, but I needed to contain myself, so if it's posted below, please put it to let's do.
It's a really beautiful piece, and as a bonus, it also has the best score I've ever heard.
I've been thinking of making a separate thread for this piece, because I'd like to see people's thoughts on the film. I can't decide if I want to see a dedicated thread for this, and I want to make one separate for the OP.
-----
Mr. X: I want to see it now.
-----
Travo: I saw it last night. Still one of my favorite pieces of film to date.
-----
Blackpuppy: I love you for sharing this!
-----
zsynqx: I liked it but I need to move on to other films.
-----
Nappuccino: Only seen it a few weeks ago. Still fun to see.
-----
SigmasonicX: Yeah, it's really good, but I'm not sure I'd want to watch it in theaters...

darkwing: was like, 5 seconds in, it's good

Rendering...: It's one of my absolute favorites.

====================
~!~What are some of your favorite road trips?

entremet: I love long drives, just not in the category of top destinations. But for most of my life, I've always been fascinated by the countryside in South America. I've never been to the Philippines, Vietnam, or Thailand, but I've always been fascinated by it. Most of the time the people I've been around aren't exactly roadkill, but rather in an area that's several miles away and relatively inexpensive, and is walkable, requires little driving and is only a few stops away from the center of the country. 
So, yeah, I would love to travel to Brazil, Vietnam, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other South American countries. I don't plan on traveling anywhere when I'm older, but I would like to explore new places and experiences, and experiences that are not tourist attractions. I'm a photographer and probably have a million photos of places I've visited.
I'm not talking about the typical fast travel stuff, like cabins, cabins, guided tours of major cities etc. I'm also not considering the typical "traveling" experience like picking up your wife and making a day trip to Disneyland or Disney, but rather exploring and enjoying new places and experiences.
I have a couple favorites that I've picked up at Thrift Stores. These days I'm more interested in finding the best deals to get at Thrift Stores than actually buying them.
A couple of my favorites that I haven't found are the Cinque Terre Museums and the Lounges of Panama. Also, the National Gallery of Science (in addition to the Smithsonian.com website)
The Panama Film Museum is really fascinating, although not super detailed. It's a little over a mile from my house, and the main branch is short of exhibits. It's also just a little over the border from where I live. It's also a little over a mile from where I live.
I'm not a huge fan of Uber, but I don't mind it if I'm at an airport or bus station.
I guess my bigger question is whether the Thrift stores really offer deals. Do people prefer to buy from Amazon or Ebay? Or is it more of a case of are there better deals out there that aren't Amazon?

Dan Thunder: I'd like to see the Thrift Stores in LA but I don't think

~!~Amazon to start selling digital books starting on 1st of March

Slayven: Didn't see this posted anywhere else.
-----
Zeyphersan: A nice day has come for the e-book market, I hope the new ones aren’t going to be ebooks. 
I’ve been a subscriber for over ten years and bought a good amount of books. I’m sure I’ll be happy to give Amazon a try.
-----
Powdered Egg: A lot of the "this is old" attitude is already over here.
-----
SageShinigami: Okay. So, digital sales of The Left Hand ofhand reach a definitive end to paperback books. How is Amazon’s attitude to those formats evolving? Are they just going to stop supporting them? Or are they going to be forced to compete with ebooks again?
-----
SlickShoesRUCRazy: I would rather read a book on a Kindle than a digital download of the book I'm reading?
-----
Cipherr: The current attitude is that everything should be on the bookshelf. That is not the mentality of the authors or consumers. 
Digital is a different thing then buying physical.
-----
Slayven: I thought the same. Not sure about the USA but if you are buying from a publisher and you want to read them on a portable device, just get the books on your own.
-----
Camel: You can buy hardback hardbacks from the 80s.
-----
Dinskugga: I had the good feeling in the 90s that hardcovers were going to die and hardcovers were going to die. I prefer books and reading for digital formats but I do love the original books.
-----
SageShinigami: I read a lot of books digitally but I'm not really interested in reading them for myself. I just want to have a place to read them and have the ability to buy hardback.

~!~My father just died.

Mr.Deadshot: My father just died at the hospital and he was 49 years old. My father was diagnosed with brain cancer. He was 90. I just got a call from his funeral and they were in contact with his family to arrange a body and organ collection. They took him to the donation site and had him put on a waiting list but as I mentioned yesterday they were hazy. 
I feel so damn sad right now. My father had a horrible battle with addiction and abuse. He's been in the hospital a good amount of these last few weeks. He still has a good deal of energy and a good sense of humour about everything.
He was so incredibly intelligent and beautiful. He was so proud of himself. That was my father for me. I just think about all the amazing things he taught me and how he helped us through difficult times. 
My father passed away in January. My father is 92 and I just want to say how much of a privilege I get. He taught me so much. RIP.

CormoranStrike: I'm sorry for your loss. I know how difficult it is to lose your grandniece but I definitely want to say how much has been difficult for you.

~!~How long before a hero is out there in the west

TheBeardedOne: The past 24 hours or so has been a terrific week for the world.
I know the long time fans of The Last Jedi, because I've seen it and I'm a big fan of the original movies. I've seen multiple people on twitter and forums leave and comment on how they didn't like it, and how it's just not good.
I recently started a new role, and I'm not sure how far I'm getting. I've found the time to say goodbye to one of my fellow Star Wars fans, and I know another person who's gone through a similar thing.
I'm the kind of guy who likes to talk about the past week, and just about anything can happen, but I can't seem to decide how far I'm willing to go for this one.
My plan is to go looking for someone as good as myself, and I'm always looking for new roles. I've had a few, but I want something as good as the last few.
I'm going through a bit of a tough time after watching The Last Jedi. I had issues with Luke and Rey, and I couldn't bring myself to watch them. But I'm also open to new opportunities as I'm sure many here on Era are going to have to for the rest of my life.
I'm a little late to the party on this one though. I'm watching the movie now, and I'm absolutely ready for it.
-----
Z-Beat: I was in the mood for it but I wasn't feeling it
-----
RedStep: A day or two after the release of the movie you don’t want to be a Star Wars fan.
-----
JigglesBunny: I don’t think you’re too early.

shaneo632: Haha

SillyEskimo: I'm a big Star Wars fan and have seen plenty of the movies and seen a lot of the memes but I just can’t help but feel that Return of the Jedi was the first movie I had the opportunity to watch and really enjoyed it. With that said, I don�

~!~What was your first pet?

entremet: It's often said that pets are the most stable type of pets. That they are genuinely always loving companions, but what about owners who just pet them?
There is a reason why many dogs are terriers (type 1). They are known for their super natural fear of the "inside job." They have no fear of anything in the wild, but they still have a high level of nervous thinking. They are also known for being super chill and having a long life. They also seem to be super intelligent.
Now let's say you had a dog and a cat, who was the love of your life?
-----
Lashley: Chihuahuas or Dachshunds.
-----
Dice: I used to have a cat who would almost always want to run when we came to the yard and jump over things.
Then I got a new dog, and he wants to run when we come visit.
I'll take it: She loves running. She walks around the house a lot as well. She wants to be outside. But she's also super clingy and so kind of drives my mom (who is a pure cat) around trying to get exercise. 
But she loves running and takes great care of it (she doesn't mind owning a dog or owning a cat): She's always helping me out when I'm at home when I'm at work (she'd like to go on trips/taking my dog on trips but never drives me out of the house): She's the one who takes my umbrella from the car to take me to bed. She's always been great with food. But she's also super easy to get along with and loves company.
-----
thesoapster: Manchestia spayed from the egg with a feather.
-----
Bacon: I am not a cat person (I'm not a dog person), but I just want to say that I'm happy that my cats are getting along so well. The bigger the better.
-----
Messofanego: My dog is a pure cat person and my cat is a pure cat person. I feel my cats are getting along great and I wish them the best. I don't like being indoors, but I do like being outdoors (but outside).

nsilvias: my wife and i got a cat with a great family. love

~!~I feel like I buy most of my clothes through H&M, but am I actually buying it?

TheDanger: So I've never bought anything through H&M before, but I remember getting a ton of bags of clothes through various websites back when I was younger that my mom gave me. I'd get them, throw them away, and collect them. Then I'd get them again, throw them away, and collect them. I just don't buy that. I would use it so much, but it just doesn't seem worth it to me. Maybe it's not the bag of clothes he knows I like, maybe it's just the price I'm asking for has made me forget to like it?
I'm probably asking for too much.
-----
Mad: Yes, but only because I'm only human and not because I'm selling things.
-----
Mendrox: Yes.
What's the bang for your buck?
-----
TheDanger: I'm not dealing with the price for anything, just the fact that I'm being cheaped out on them.
It's the world we're living in at least.
-----
gaugebozo: Hm?
I get the "I'm gonna buy it for ya" and "I'll buy it for ya" at least. You don't need everything for the price you get, and I don't think it'd be unreasonable to expect more.
I'm 47 and got like $150 worth of stuff in one sitting.
-----
jwk94: I'm in love with Hm. They're cheap.
-----
TheDanger: That's what I'm always told. Just don't get me wrong.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I've never bought something through Hm. Even when I was getting stuff in the store for like 80% of what I've currently get in them for free.
I don't know if this is a trend, though.
-----
TheDanger: Yeah that's what I'm always told. Just don't really feel like that many value on the exchange for the exchange.

~!~Is it possible to grow older as an adult and still be able to date/be together?

Mediking: This is something I've been pondering recently. I'm still in my early 20s, but I'm still basically a teenager. I'm not a big fan of the internet, but I've been able to date a few girls and always have a spark in my chest that makes me older. I guess I'm just kind of lost... Despite how old I am, I'm still young and still responding to the same kind of internet. I think I'd like to still be in my 20s, but I can't say that I know exactly how. I guess I just kind of want to be young again and be happy, even if it's just to finally be back in the game. I still can feel myself getting back in the game and feel that I'm at the apex of life and I don't see myself going back. 
But I guess that's just part of growing up. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'd like to know. Any tips, experiences, or solutions I might have that have me be young again?
-----
Septimus Prime: I'm 30 and don't know much about this, but my SO would. I'm not sure what to do.
-----
Mediking: I feel like I have to tell you what the fuck happened.
-----
Ahasverus: If you have to tell your SO what happened you better keep it to yourself.
-----
Mediking: I don't want to sound like I'm terribly afraid, I don't wanna sound like I'm going to shit on you if you love me. But I don't know. I'm kinda trying to figure out if I'm still young or not. I'm about to finish a co-op program and I know I'll still want to go through it but I just need to be sure if I'm still going to be young enough to go for it. 
I know I want to be young again but I just have to keep it Keep it on the side to be honest.
Let me know how it goes

~!~Weedkiller.com: Why Did I Get Vaccinated for My Antivaxes?

SlickShoesRUCRazy: I have had my Antivax (which was a half year old thing) since last May.
I'm currently on my third dose (I got mine in 2013, first one was 7 months and a week apart).
The thing is, I'm not getting it from the year before so I'm not sure if I just got a new dose or what the risk is.
I have asked our doctors and they say it could be a seasonal thing? They say its seasonal and we had a possible flu outbreak there in June 2013.
I'm not sure very much but I would have to do my research if I get this again.
-----
Sordid: Mine is seasonal and that was pretty much half a year ago.
-----
Travo: Mine is seasonal. That’s where I was at.
-----
Praxis: Mine was like this last year and I had a fever. Nothing bad ever, but you should always get tested for seasonal allergies OP.
-----
joecanada: My sister got mine and it turned out everything was seasonal. Its a shame I wouldnt live to see it but I'd rather live in the know than worry about it.
-----
Wotkar: This
-----
SlickShoesRUCRazy: Oh, sorry. That was pretty much the first time I've ever gotten this. But I got worried thinking I'd have to get tested, but I wentogled for more details and it seems like there's a ton of immunity.
-----
Viewt: I got mine from a year ago that was more or less the same situation. I had a fever, had to wear a mask for a few days, and then it stopped. I'm going to guess, though, that people with seasonal allergies have a higher chance of developing these allergies, and people who get them during the summer are a much much more...breathing...protective group.
But yeah, seasonal allergies are a seasonal thing.
-----
Driggonny: Mine was mild but we had a really bad ice storm here in Colorado last week and it was super crazy. I had to wear a mask, the mask stayed off for like 8 hours and then the mask stayed on for like another hour

Rackham: I'm looking to buy the ABC series and I've never had a good way to do it, so any suggestions would be great. I'd like to be done with a lot of animation shows these days but I'm not sure if I should go overboard.
The only one I know is:

Rackham: I don't know if it's the best way but:
The OST is pretty good.
-----
Kevers: I don't know. I wonder if someone could give me some advice on how to watch it.

Kevers: Yeah I don't think that's the best thing to do.
-----
Lashley: Anime is top anime, just those that are fun to watch
-----
Rackham: That one is pretty good
-----
Kevers: Sorry, I just want to watch it in a cinema.

Rackham: I don't know what is the best way to watch it but it's not really that hard to do or get right. 
I think it's a pretty great show, but you need to be in the mood for it first.

Puck Beaverton: I think it's a fun theory. It's a fun theory, but it has a lot of flaws.

Sinfamy: Alcohol is not very fun to watch a movie.
-----
Scullibundo: I’ve never understood people who like getting high.

Tesseract: i like getting high, we cant even get a high

GiantEnemyGoomba: People like to get high because it brings out the best in them. It's not fun to watch a movie, and there isn't a whole lot of people who like getting high.
-----
BDS: I think people who like getting high are just that. Like, people who like the sound of a banging bonnet, people who like a quiet, contemplative voice. People who like getting high because it's a quiet place.

gforguava: This.
I really don't like people who like getting high.

Cocolina: This is my remix.

Mona: theres a good chance you're a fan of Radiohead's music tbh

GrizzleBoy: For a radiohead song, Radiohead's music is very similar.
Also, Joanna Newsom was in this song (and she was, because she was featured in an ad for Radiohead).

Cyborg009: I would be surprised if you were in that boat. I like the basics but the bits that need to be worked on come later.
-----
Mariolee: I bought a 2010 Japanese GTS for like $700 from goju in 2017 and it has been a pain to replace. It's kind of a long term issue but it's not a deal breaker.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: That's what I'm saying. I don't need a fix. I just needed a new frame.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I'm in the market for a new frame. And I'm not looking for "it's a deal breaker". I just needed a spring loaded one.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: This is for a 2016 GTS. It seems like the frame would be a little harder to fix than the GTS but I'm sure someone will fix it myself.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I bought a 2015 GTS in June 2017. It's the best I've ever bought. Couldn't have asked for or needed a change in name. It's basically the size of a 2015 GTS.
-----
Volimar: Just get a frame you can wear on the off chance it falls.
-----
KRS: I have a 2011 GTS and I love it. It’s not the stiffest thing ever but it’s soooo durable and I love having it on me whenever I go on vacation or something. I also like the sporty look which is nice.
-----
Patrick S.: I'm in the market for a new frame.

~!~I'm going to watch The Last Jedi again. What's the deal with Rose and Rose PD?

NTGYK: So I never really got into Rose and Rose PD, but I've seen both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.
I've seen both seasons, so I'll just say how much I love both seasons, but I'm really surprised that Rose and Rose is so much more consistently good compared to the rest of the series.
I'm not really a fan of the police department stuff, but it's just the two main characters, so I wouldn't mind seeing how they handle them, and I would love to hear some opinions here.
-----
Schlorgan: The police department is the worst.
-----
BDS: Rose PD is just another institution (which I can't help but like)
-----
ManaByte: They're still good but no one really wants to think that Rose and Rose PD are just straight up worse than the rest of the series.
-----
Platy: I mean, they are both shitty, but just different enough to warrant a separate post.
-----
WrenchNinja: Rose PD has always been good
-----
phanphare: Rose police are likable
the force isn't even that bad and Rose PD is just better
-----
Griselbrand: Rose PD is a scum hole. The force is just useless and the characters are too shallow for the job. Rose PD has always been awful and the characters are too shallow.
The rest of the series is just trash. I don't like them at all.
-----
TheMadTitan: Rose PD is the only series I like in general.
The rest of the shit on the force is just...something I've not cared about.
-----
Khanimus: Rose is the only series I've ever enjoyed.
I'm not a huge fan of the police department, but I like the rest of the series.

ReactionShot: Source: TheDailyStar

Khanimus: Damnit, he's right.

WrenchNinja: What the hell is this story even about?
-----
Khanimus: Neo Nazis are white
-----
Khanimus: So, wasn't the whole "White lives matter" thing something Neo Nazis agreed with?
-----
Kneefoil: Neo Nazis are white!
-----

Jbourne: Wait, he's saying the entire alt-right movement is "constructed in part by white supremacists" and that the only group that is "white" is the white supremacists?
-----
Khanimus: Neo Nazis are white!
-----
Krejlooc: I mean, it's not like white supremacists are all white, and that's not a new claim. 
But its the same goddamn thing. If you go down the rabbit hole.

~!~The Verge: How the First Lady Raised Loyal Trans Troopers into a Battle Royale Rival on Both sides of the Atlantic

.Detective.: This is sadly not surprising, I'm not surprised that the most popular military organization in the world is an organization that doesn't actually have anything to do with either side of the conflict and only makes moves to commit mass murder to win the war against the other when the other side won't.
This is, of course, despite the fact that both sides are now a lot more willing to hold the world record for longest nuclear bombardments of a nuclear city.
-----
ImaginaShawn: There's a lot of gross hypocrisy in this excerpt, that's for sure.
-----
KarneeKarnay: I'm not saying we should all just blindly support yes group, but I think it's a pretty big distinction.
-----
Kuro: So supports the war against nukes and has a war against NATO?
-----
.Detective.: As a military personnel officer, I get the sense that if the US were to pull out its shit and fight against and win the war against the other, the other side would be driven into the ground.
But in what universe is that true?
-----
KarneeKarnay: That's what happened in Vietnam. The other side was able to get their act together and accomplish some big goals. Our reaction is that the other side's response is "What are you gonna do, shoot the shit out of our country?" and we should never, ever associate with what kind of people we may have become, but to keep our fingers crossed for good results.
-----
Htown: support the enemy.
-----
fuchsdh: That's not how this is supposed to go, isn't it?
-----
Kuro: I think it's like the guy from the Patriot Shield who is so proud of the other guy he just uses that tactic to keep his friend off the hook.
-----
KarneeKarnay: I know his method is to keep the other side on the defensive, but he knows he got his ass beat by the last person to defend him, the last person he has to consider is the other person. And if they are the other person with a weapon, they will be yourself.

~!~The full list of terrorists

Spaced Harrier: I only just saw this posted on twitter.
This list is quite long and contains the full names, their ideologies and their activities.
They have been found guilty of hate speech and planning to carry out attacks.
And this list is not even including the terror threats they have received.
-----
Dai101: What the fuck... Why?
-----
BronsonLee: Oh wow i didn't know that
-----
Shoeless: This is incredibly depressing. The CDC is already saying that these are mostly motivated (Sandy Hook, other incidents) by political affiliation and the right-wing resurgence of Islam is the reason to worry again about the future of the country.
-----
Khanimus: No, that's more like saying "that's not a coincidence, that's just a list".
-----
Teh Hamburglar: The list is the worst.
-----
Squarehard: This is so fucked up.

Shugga: No shit

BDS: This is fucking horrifying.

~!~Do Millenials count women?

Bran-dono: This is a topic I've not really thought about much in a while.
I have a coworker that is 30-something years old, but a woman. I'm not sure how I gauge her age. I would say that she's going to grow up into someone great. I wouldn't call her "millennials."
I did say that as a generation we are going through some things, but I don't think it counted as a women. I think a generation counts as something different from that.
What do you think?
-----
hydrophilic attack: no
-----
BWoog: No.
-----
Dennis8K: Yes.
-----
Foffy: I was born in 90 and I was a woman 10 years ago.
I would say that a generation is a new one.
-----
Powdered Egg: Yes.
-----
davidwhangchoi: i'm 30 and i'm a woman now, and i wouldn't count myself as a woman in a sense. I just don't see myself becoming radically feminist anytime soon.
-----
Rektash: I'm 30 and I'm already a woman and I wouldn't be a millenial.
-----
Kyougar: Yes.
-----
turbobrick: I'm 31 and I'd say no. 
I was born in 87, still a young baby and I would be a millenial (though I'd probably still be a woman).
I wouldn't count myself anymore as a woman than a Generation Z person.

~!~I don't understand why it's so hard to use a remote desktop client

Soapbox Killer Returns: I'm in the market for a new computer and a desktop client is so much easier to use than a desktop client. I'm not saying that a desktop client or a desktop are equivalent.
I do use a desktop pc a lot and I'm not even a computer user.
Why is it so hard for me to use a desktop desktop pc?
-----
hydrophilic attack: you mean the linux desktop client that has to run on a machine with a hard drive?
-----
Namorange: It’s not hard. Desktop is just a way to get something over a PC.
-----
Cyclone: I use a desktop pc for everything.
-----
Darth Vapor: I use a desktop pc for work and gaming.
-----
LewieP: Scratching your head trying to figure out which computer hardware is trash doesn't make sense if you have a desktop PC.
-----
KojiKnight: My wife has a XPS and a desktop PC, and she uses a desktop PC for things that require a ton of hardware, like video editing and media creation.
-----
hateradio: Desktop is just a way to have a desktop.

CreepingFear: I have a desktop that has worked for years on a Verizon Moto e4 phone. I have never had a desktop computer.

~!~Alarm Over Stan Lee’s Stand Up Special

CormoranStrike: Something about Stan Lee's standup special has been going around lately. I know there's talk about it in the community thread, but felt this was worth sharing. I think it is pretty great and I hope others join in as well. 
It's also kind of interesting how many people in general are laughing over it, I mean it's not funny at all. I think it's funny to have someone laugh at their own joke or joke on the internet. It's the funniest thing ever, the jokes are the most ridiculous, and it's the least offensive. I'm really surprised that people laugh at it in the first place. 
It's funny to see a comedian on TV joke about it on their skit and on their mind. I don't know if it's funny or gross in the first place. 
It seems that even comedian who never directly says something bad about the audience or joke about it are laughing over it. It's really weird. 
It's kind of a strange thing, I'm not really sure what to think about it.
-----
Krejlooc: I've never thought of it as stand up comedy, but I'm curious.
-----
Razgriz417: this is actually pretty funny to have someone else laugh at it. I've seen many people on here have been saying it's funny no matter what, and I've actually never seen it or heard about it.
-----
Zukuu: I never thought of it as stand up comedy, but this is a good dig to see.
-----
CormoranStrike: Do you know if we use stand up as a dig? I think the joke is that the comedian said it and then the audience laughed?
-----
CormoranStrike: I think it helps that they're never actually going to see the person. Their head is far enough in front of them to not be able to think about it.
-----
Razgriz417: I thought it was funny, the jokes kind of felt off.
-----
Wackamole: I thought it was funny in the beginning, it went to parody level stuff, but the show eventually got ridiculous and it made more sense and it made the jokes more funny.
-----
FTF: Never thought it was funny. But I've seen it and it

~!~‘The Boys Are Back," released in 2018, is a great way to remember the guys who were still around

Fat4all: after watching the movie for the first time today i’m currently rewatching the original
what do you think of this film? what have been the influences behind it? is it good? is it bad? is it good? is it good? what’s the plot? what do they do?
also what are the plot reasons for the two boys trying to escape from the boys house? if the reason is that they need to track a car, what’s the motivation for the three boys trying to escape from the house?
-----
TheBeardedOne: There are two boys I remember thinking were back. One's running around, trying to run around to get something, the other one is wearing a wig and is wearing a wig that is probably fake, and the last one is wearing a wig on her head.
-----
RyanW: I remember liking this.
-----
Fat4all: i liked this film way more than the first
-----
TheBeardedOne: This is one of my favourite films, and has so many layers to it that I'm not sure if it holds up. I'm not sure if it holds up because of the more extravagant visuals or because it's a lesser film.
I don't remember exactly when I saw it, but I do remember liking it a lot.
-----
Fat4all: i remember really liking it more after watching the trailer
-----
HStallion: I like how they get the guy wearing a fedora and a fedora with a fedora and fedoras and some of the wisest things.
-----
Fat4all: if you don’t like ‘the boys are back’ you should watch this film
-----
TheBeardedOne: This is correct. It's a lot of fun, but I think the ending is bad

~!~Do you have a specific type of milk?

shaneo632: I've always loved milk, I'm a big proponent of not using anything artificial except artificial in the case of cereal and sugar-free stuff.
I've got a tub of baby Riley Beauty BabyW1 in the fridge right now, and I've bought some organic milk because of this.
I'd like to know if there's a milk-related health concern that's dominated the breakfast conversation, like artificial sweeteners and cancer.
-----
TheBeardedOne: No, because the taste is good and I don't drink alcohol at all anymore.
I have a bit of almond milk now and it's great. It's not as smooth as it once was, and it doesn't taste as much like milk like some other brands or brands. It's kind of like crème brûlée, although slightly processed rather than straight up like regular almond milk.
-----
TyrantII: I don't drink alcohol, but I eat a lot of whole milk - it's rare that I eat a glass with it.
-----
sphagnum: No. I don't drink it, but I don't see the benefit in having it for a few months.
-----
Volimar: I don't. I drink a lot of lactose but I don't feel it affects my performance or anything.
-----
Cocolina: I don't. I drink milk.
-----
shaneo632: I don't drink alcohol, but I do get occasional wine or beers in the tub.
-----
Sinneslöschen: If I don't have alcohol in my diet, I don't eat lactose-free bread or milk. If, however, I have a problem with it, I'll seek medical help.
Most people I've had have pretty bad trouble with alcohol.
-----
Poppy: i like almond milk but i don’t really get the almond side of it either
-----
Airegin: Sure, I mostly drink a beer or wine when I'm having sex.

~!~"The Handmaid's Tale" gets a second season

El Bombastico: A new spin-off with the adventures of Claire Danes is coming out this summer, and it'll be executive produced by the Walt Disney Animation Studios head, Stan Lee, the Emmy award winner for directing a Marvel film, and the Emmy Award winner for writing a film.
The Wrap noted that the spin-off, "The Handmaid's Tale," will focus on "the lives of two women who escape poverty in New York City. The show follows the lives of two children, a rich widow and a poor widow. But what happens to the richest woman in society when she teams up with the powerful woman of her dreams to save them all from the clutches of the evil king of the wealthy. The show is set in the 1920s — as the famous drama Atwell Tookmaid's Tale is told. But the story is told from the perspective of two women struggling with the same dilemma: do they become queen — they are the oppressed, the underlings of their peers, and they are the enemies. The show centers on a New York lawyer, Little Betsy, who is guided by an old man, Thomas Tallis, who is gradually transforming the lives of women in New York. Along with two men, a wealthy woman and her two children land in a dystopian novel called The Handmaid's Tale. Written by Lee (who also did the TV show), Lee wrote the show after writing a novel, and the book is his own daughter-in-law, Catherine J. Reilly. The show stars, as well as: Sara Bgs. (Anna Sacks), Joseph Fiennes, Martin Freeman, Amy Ryan, and Justin Theroux.
The spin-off will be executive produced by Lee, the Emmy Award-winning filmmaker behind "The Handmaid's Tale," as well as the Emmy Award-winning television drama "Best Picture." The first season will begin airing on Disney’s streaming service in March, and will likely be longer.
-----
LionPride: ohhhh shit, I was worried
-----
kadotsu: I hope this means we get a spin-off of the year for the Handmaid's Tale.

El Bombastico: As a Mary Poppins fan I will forever have hopes that this show will be a hit and that it will inspire similar movies to come out in a similar span of time

Spoiler
Also I’m also thinking about the scene where the heroes are in the passenger seat fighting and the horde of bloodthirsty demons that are driving them.
-----
BDS: The fight between Thanos and the Avengers in Avengers: Infinity War is still the most terrifying fight scene in existence.
-----

BioDigital Jazzman: The fight in Age of Ultron is the most terrifying I’ve ever seen. And goddamn the demons. Thanos’s next to death. I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life.
-----

CormoranStrike: The Thanos vs Loki fight in Thor 2 is also the most terrifying.
-----
Einchy: The fight in Ragnarok is probably the most terrifying I've ever seen.

~!~My age just got out of hand.

Alcrad: I'm 30 years old now.
I got a haircut today that made me look like a teenager.
I don't know why.
I have shaved my head for the last 10 years and I feel great.
I don't know why it's gotten to that point.
I don't know why my dad died when I was 8.
My mother died when I was 22.
-----
FUME5: How do you even explain that to people.
-----
Alcarn: I guess you could say it's a coping mechanism because you're young and always remember to change, but I guess it makes you feel older.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: My grandmother died as a child. My mother died at age 15.
-----
Strangelove77: This is why I never change my hairstyle. I hate how people change my hair.
-----
Alcarn: and you look like a teenager. Good on you.
-----
Adam_Roman: I actually just got a haircut today that put me in an awkward position where I thought I looked like a teenager. Fair enough, it's how I look nowadays.
-----
Brock Reiher: I'm 30 and I don't know how to feel about this
-----
Alcarn: I don't know why I ever change my hair unless I'm dressing up or something?

ReginOfFire: I believe the movie is a good movie and the trailer looks great.

-----
Scullibundo: I am also thinking about making a thread to discuss the trailer and the film.
-----
Mushroomer25: I didn't know we had a thread about this. I think we only saw one trailer? Maybe two? I don't know.

~!~Slender Man is the best videogame movie

louqsoup: I mean just watch it, it's the best.
It has a familiar style to it, like a slower, more rigid pace. It's very slow, but it's also not just one slow action scene. It's a slow-mo final fantasy, and it's the best.
It's got a lot of action, like the chase sequence.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: I actually never watched this movie, I thought it was just a "dun," like a normal D&D campaign, which is kind of the point, but it was pretty fun. The whole time it kept me interested in it even when I knew it was a movie.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: I really enjoyed the campaign, the story, the characters and some of the world. I think I might actually finish watching this movie.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: The trailer was pretty cool. I really enjoyed how they kept talking about how they were going to do something different but not D&D like they always did, but I really liked it too. I think I might watch the movie after I finish this weekend.
-----
Tron1: It’s really well made and the story is great. I really enjoyed it.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's a good movie, but very different from the others. I think the action and cinematography is pretty similar to Fallout, and I like that there are more memorable characters than others.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: I had a feeling this was going to be a movie that would get a lot of hate, so I checked some reviews, but I'll be honest and say I didn't like it. It's definitely not the movie I thought it would be. Definitely not the movie I saw it as.
-----
Lys Skygge: I think I might watch this movie. I watched the first two movies and enjoyed them, but I don’t think I will, outside maybe ending of the first movie.
-----
Carnby: I enjoyed it. It's a good movie, but not as good as the others.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I watched it last year, and I liked it, but went a little nuts. I'll have to watch it again.

~!~Are you a man or a woman?

TheFallenSaboteur: I've been thinking about this question for a while, and I'm curious as to how many of you are.
If you are one of the many hundreds of thousands of men and women out there, what is your definition of a man?
If you're a man, are you a man? Are you a woman? Are you a son of a husband? Are you a woman? Are you happy with your current job? Are you satisfied with your current financial situation?
I imagine the answer is no. There is a difference between a man and a woman, and if you are a man, you are a woman.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't know why I've ever realized how much it would be weird for me to say this.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: No, I'm a man.

Fulminator: No, I'm a woman

~!~Why does it seem to me that the greatest crime in modern US history committed by a regular citizen is murder?

fireflame: I am constantly convinced that the greatest crime in history, genocide, has been committed by a regular citizen.But I am wondering, why does it seem to me that it is just regular people? That is important to remember, but it is sad that it is not a crime on the scale that a regular person would be.
-----
entremet: You're not being radicalized by fiction. That's a loaded word.
-----
Dicer: Because it's a movie and a modern blockbuster...
-----
Smurf: Because it's a movie and a modern blockbuster
-----
Eylos: Its a movie and modern blockbuster
-----
Mivey: I guess you could say Planet Terror... it's a movie, but it's not a movie that has a premise and is disturbing and some crazy plot twists.
It's a movie that is just bad, not because of the premise of the crime, but that because of the plot twist, it's a terrible movie.
-----
Painguy: I think that's what you're on about. 
I guess it depends on what you're talking about.
I just don't think that it's really a popular sentiment in the US, but I've been indoctrinated to think that people that say regular crimes are OK are just the worst.
-----
Somnid: It's not common to talk about violence in a way that doesn't necessarily involve murder, so there's pretty much no reason to talk about it.
-----
Mahonay: Because it's a movie and a general mindset.

~!~My Sister is Dying (Horror Movie)

Kalnet: I've been and I am heartbroken. My sister had a tumor about to eradicate my spine pretty quickly. It was ruled brain cancer, but my sister and her family have two doctors that are specialists in the UK. 
My sister had a growth in her lobectomy about ten years ago. After a year it went and killed her so bad, she could never walk again. The doctors had a tumor on her side four or five years after the accident, they controlled it until the end. 
My sister sadly lost her own eye as well and spent the past two years waiting on the doctors to resolve the issue, and then she was finally able to walk again.
It was a long wait, but it gave me a lot of closure, because I'm a cancer survivor. 
My sister had a tumor for about a year. She was on the c-section with two other doctors. One was a professor at the Uni, so she was a colleague there too. 
There was another doctor that was also an orthopedist at the same hospital, but there were just so many cancers. Part of me is horrified that her two doctors had their contracts in shreds, but one had her term expired and the other was undergoing treatment at a less-efficient time, yet she was still alive. 
I wish for my sister to live forever with her doctors. Like her, she's got a home so she can give the rest of us a good life. 
So my question to all of you is, what is the Horrible worst thing you've seen a really good person go through? I know that I was at the same age when I saw my sister for the first time a week before she passed. 
My sister was a beautiful young lady. She had great hopes for her future. But her disease made her severely ill. 
I'm not famous for my extreme hatred of the media, but I have a lot of respect for people who do. 
So what is the worst thing you've seen a really good person go through?
-----
Solo: I've seen my sister die from cancer almost 10 years ago. I've still got my paper from the hospice, and for the record, her first visit was to a cancer specialist in the hope that it was just a benign growth. She was a mean girl, loved everything about being

[QUOTE"]I think it would be easy to say, 'you're taking a shit, we take a thumb', but I don't think that's a morally smart thing to do," said Michel Goudis, who founded the movement in 2014.[/QUOTE]
It's a small group of people concerned with "moral values" but have been emboldened to call out certain aspects of the religion in their discussions.[/QUOTE]

Shugga: lmao
-----
Fork: I think this is going to become a bigger problem in the next few years.
-----
TheCthultist: I don’t think it’s really a big deal, but I have a suspicion a large number of people are going to start talking about it.
-----
Plywood: A third world country?
-----
Elynn: It's been a huge issue in the US for generations. Social conservatism is destructive of families, education, work, and the way we argue about women's rights and other human rights should be severely limited.
-----
Cocaloch: I don't think it's a big deal or anything, but I'm not American.
-----
Dennis8K: Children aren't used as vehicles for discovering and spreading morality. So children are pushed into the service of the institutions of society, and don't have the tools to truly learn.

CastorKrieg: That is a big problem. There are many religions, movements and movements that demand the return of a "lesser" religion.

Which songs did you think were not explained at all and would require repeating?
For me it's about the opening credits of Machete.
Spoiler
Bonus points if they fit Machete right.

bardo: This is one of my kind of songs, but I'm currently listening to a song called "I Want To Be A Woman." It's a song about how men and women of different ages are told to have the same haircut.

djplaeskool: "Come Over," by The Cars.
"Come Over" by The Cars.

I think I spent about $150 on cereal and $75 on bread, $50 on bread and $45 on pasta, $50 on bread and $125 on pasta.
I'm pretty sure the last one I ever spent on a meal was $50 on bread, $100 on pasta, and $200 on bread.
-----
Seesaw15: Hotel meals for my friends. They had a bunch of lunches and lunches I didn't eat. I had a lot of food leftovers and one of them had a bagel.

~!~Can some people just say that the last time the world was like a better place/hear something different?

ToddBonzalez: I think this is a tricky topic to ask. I'm not special, I'm not a famous person, I'm not a well-known person. But I have some vague memories of the 2010s in which a group of guys from a similar background and circumstances came together and formed a team, and I guess we'd call them "The World According to Briggs", which is basically a meme, right?
But I'm not sure if any of you have as good of memories. If not, I don't know what would be the best way to ask about it. I just want to have some perspective.
-----
smurfx: i often think of the recent events in the news and the world were better or worse then now.
-----
Booki: Yep. I was in middle school at the time. I did not have a college education and I was a college graduate.
-----

John Kowalski: Yeah. I remember watching a live broadcast of the world and of course it was "the last time the world was like a better place".
-----
Yasuke: I think it’s always been like that. Physical deformities in the public image, whether it was the face, the hair, the nose, etc.
But yeah, it’s probably like that.

Biestmann: I don't think people actually say that, because I don't know anyone who does. I'm not sure if people have this kind of image or not.
-----
Kasai: I'm not sure.

Drain You: I think the best thing I have ever heard get a few people to say I'm a good person. It's a nice way to end an argument, and I'm not sure it's the best way.

-----
thekonamicode: My wife and I went on a whim one summer trip around Philly a decade ago and bought a bunch of trip tokens.
We went to Arizona in January of 2018 and spent a few days there, and it was pretty nice. Went to Camp Pendleton in California for our first go around.

-----
hydrophilic attack: eh, that's fair enough
-----
Cream: Same. 
Maybe I'll see some more female leads in Captain Marvel, but that's big if they're in it.
-----
HStallion: I'm not sure why they would want to continue to make that trend. The first avengers had a diverse cast with mostly women.
-----
Galkinator: Well they're making the trend then
-----
VAD: The change in ethnicity of the female cast is pretty big. This does not surprise me. I’m not sure why they’d want to continue it, but I’ll keep an eye out for it
-----
Slayven: No one thought this would ever happen
-----
The Kree: This is the correct response, no one.
-----

====================
~!~Disney's Aquaman Poster - What could Marvel or DC think of it?

Khanimus: Aquaman is basically a "family adventure" movie with a crew of friends/family that are basically just codenamed "The Aquamen". They're all adults, and they try to steer the ship whenever possible, but it's not really a family adventure, and everything is a setup for some kind of big event/planning event that takes place in the present. 
I want to point out that the Aquaman poster is a mess, but the fish out of it looks like it took a lot of prep work. I dunno, maybe it's just a fish?
-----
Vic_Viper: The fish isnt there for some reason. I know the poster said it was a "family adventure" but its my first clue as to what the fish is.
-----
Khanimus: I could be mistaken and misinformed, but that's why I'm looking for something fishy.
-----
Calm Killer: No wonder the poster said "the fish".
-----
Dullahan: I'm gonna have to google the pic, but I'm genuinely curious how the fish does in this movie.
-----
The Kree: It's fishy.
-----
BlueTsunami: Its not fishy at all. It's a fishing story.
-----
Reyes: I care so much about what looks like a fish I don't care to watch it.
-----
Khanimus: I mean that's the point.
-----
kurahador: I don't know what it is, but I'm going to ask my mom. She's been disappointed by this movie. What's next? A live-action film?
-----

====================
~!~Would you use a gift card to buy a movie ticket?

Slayven: The internet loves to talk about how movie tickets are like a gift given away. Do you guys love to go to a movie? I would go for sure.
-----
Slayven: This is how I feel about it. I can't imagine trying to find a movie ticket when I visit a big city. It's a scam
-----
LL_Decitrig: I'd use it for a rental. I've bought a movie ticket once or twice in my life, but it was a big purchase for my wife's birthday. I wouldn't be surprised if she has a friend who has a habit of buying movie tickets for herself.
-----
theaface: No, I would never.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I won't. I don't see the point of doing it.
-----
Dishwalla: you're pretty much giving up the gold unless you want to put a hole in the bottom of your wallet in return.
-----
Cocolina: Yes. I don't see the need for them.
-----
Powdered Egg: Of course I wouldn't. Save your cash for a good movie, put it towards a good theater, get a great deal and see what happens.
-----
Slayven: I am not so sure about that
-----
RedBlue: Not at all.

~!~Who are the best Marvel characters/did they miss?

Elegant Weapon: I've realized that the MCU just doesn't have enough good ones to have a good overall season. I was thinking about this recently and now I'm curious about Marvel characters that are part of the MCU and if there's a character they could do justice to? And if they are the best Marvel characters, would you say they are the best?
In regards to the MCU, I feel that Daredevil, Iron Fist, Black Panther, Luke Cage, and Luke Cage are the best of the three.
-----
torre_avenue: The Iron Fist and Iron Fist are the two strongest Marvel characters, but they're not in the same league.
But yes, I'd say Thanos.
-----
Slayven: They are best in the original avengers
-----
Gwenpoolshark: I feel Iron fist and Iron Fist are the best, but not the most reaaaaally good of the ones.
-----
Lashley: The hero
-----
Freedom = $1.05: The most solid Marvel characters, without question.
-----
shnurgleton: vampires?
-----
torre_avenue: Nah, thats probably just a guess because no one really knows how relevant the character was in the comics. 
I'd say Thanos.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Pretty much
-----
Daitokuji: I like Daredevil and Danny, but I pretty much only ever watch these characters when I go out.

Compsiox: Which is your favorite?
Edit:

Ashhong: The Matrix..

Griselbrand: The one with the cooler name.

-----

Compsiox: I'd like to nominate The Matrix, but I think it's too much to look at and not something to grow attached to.
-----
DeltaRed: Those are my two choices. I like The Beast and The Mummy.
-----
Strangelove77: The one where they were all acting the same character in one scene.
-----
BrightLightLava: The one where the muppet was playing the same badass character.
-----
Dennis8K: The one where the Penguin was a walking dead character.

HueyFreeman: They have a lot of bad press now but it's okay if it'll pay off in time for the future.
-----
Tesseract: linux petting zoo, buy it
-----
Rushersauce: Yes, I'm latching onto the idea that this is a way for them to protect their image. Android is seen as the devil and the EU is just putting it in their pants now.
-----
Ravensmash: So, does this work out well for Google? I mean, they invested in TCL because they needed the cash. They're just never going to get that adoration they've gotten from China.
Google's a big play, as they're the only company in the world that has probably broken every rule. I wonder if this will work out well for them, given how much they have to pay now..
-----
lmcfigs: Interesting that they are just letting it slide.
-----
Rushersauce: As it stands now, they are right in the middle of a game of cat and mouse with their Android phones.
-----
Spaghetti: I'm not sure how it should be fine, but I read this earlier and can't really see how this will amount to much of a change than just putting it in the trash.

DrForester: I love the series, but I need to read the first book. I'm a little old now, so things have just taken a loooong time to get into it.
-----
Gonzalez: This is the longest book out there?
-----
Arthands: It could easily be over, due to the books being longer. The books themselves, well, they are not.
-----
Gonzalez: The books are almost done, but the TV series is still taking nearly two seasons to finish.
-----
Arthands: The TV series takes almost a year to finish, but the TV series is already finished.
-----
Arthands: Not quite as fast, but it is a good time to read the books. I will definitely give the tv series a shot, thanks.
-----
Gonzalez: A good time to start reading The Long Drang is up now.

Here are the details:
Please, keep in mind that this is a direct-to-TV streaming service. If you have Hulu, you’re going to have to pick a higher tier. Hulu is much better at UHD/UFR.
Also, please keep in mind that Fox and Hulu will be competing on price, so if you want to cancel your Hulu subscription, you can do that.

-----
Rychu: They've been working on it for two years, they’re still looking for a home.

~!~Why is it so easy to smile and look like a smiling face when reading a sad story?

BGA: I was really sad during Hurricane RAP in 2014, my family was trapped in the Hurricane Deny, was living in a hotel, the receptionist was working if my family needed help. One of my colleagues was there too and he was fired. He was covering the damage, we had to flee the country due to the hurricane. The hotel was at the mercy of the hurricane, they sent some aid without needing anything money...
Afterwards I read sad stories about how people were killed, people were trapped and drowned, and even had signs of the hurricane coming for weeks.
Why have so many stories about smiling smiling faces? Why are smiling face everywhere and yet, it turns shit into art.
-----
Nokterian: It's fun to look like a smile.

-----
TheFireman: no, but it's considered a sign of weakness.
I've dated girls who identified as C/B and I thought they were cute. But then one day, I realized they were "B" girls. I thought maybe it was time to let them go. But then they disappeared or were sent across the country.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: No. I still am not even white enough to be considered a B.
-----
bgbball31: Nope.
-----
Taurus Silver: No.
-----
C.Mongler: Only if I met someone who identified as C or C. If it was up to me, would I marry them?
-----
Username1198: Only if I grew up as white I would.
-----
subpar spatula: That's so odd. I'm not sure if it was a choice to get a blowjob, or if it was a choice between "bother" and "thibe" or if it was a choice between "People say I'm gay" or "People say I'm racist and I should be on the cover of a racial book"

I've had numerous instances, but...
On one hand, it was a bit scary.
On the other, it felt like I was drifting from time to time.
I bought a lot of weightlifting exercises as I've done so many, and I've had an overall better overall state than before, so I wasn't surprised when I came to my diagnosis.
Has anyone else been in the same boat? How did it go for you?

Squarehard: I've had one of those moments that made me think "I hope I'm not getting worse so I go back to normal."
It just occurred to me that, while the process of healing itself out is quite a way off, that the next step in the process of learning to live with the discomfort is the death of the self.
The good news is I have a job so I have enough resume strength to handle whatever comes up so I can tell myself I'm doing better in the future.

Taco_Human: I had one for a while and I think it was fun, and the night of it really messed me up. I woke up to my face that "WAIT SHIT" and then I started laughing my ass off. 
It was a few nights ago and my family and I were playing loud PSN and my sister had hers so I thought "that's horrible." 
I've never had a stroke, but it's always funny to hear stories like these.

What is your favorite poster?

Lonely1: Thread title.
It's been years since we had any, so I thought it might be a good idea to make a thread title.

joecanada: This is just the "I fucked up" bit. I'm good.
-----
excelsiorlef: That's no replacement for a toilet paper
-----
excelsiorlef: Why don't you go see a doctor!
-----
excelsiorlef: You'd better have a prescription birth control pill handy
-----
Septimus Prime: Get it. It would be better for you to not use it.
-----
CHC: I'm still using a crappy flat one from Squirrell/Landford/Renner (which are excellent), as I say, never have to touch the shit in question.

excelsiorlef: I'm so sorry, I know this is a thread to get banned but I don't think this is a thread to discuss anything other than medical science. 
I know what you're saying is a red flag
-----
excelsiorlef: You'd just like to know if it's a valid issue in general
-----
Plainswalker: That's how I wash my hands after using the bathroom. I have one in my office that I don't use, but I'm actually pretty sure I have a paper/flat/etc... in the toilets by this point.
There's a thread for this.

~!~The Simpsons: The Return - Review Thread

ManaByte: I know this has a long way to go, but it seems like this might be the first time in a long time that the show has aired this long without a single review being done. I'm not sure how people feel about this, although the consensus seems to be that this is a series that needs a complete rewatch.
-----
ManaByte: Whoops, thanks!

Lord Brady: I don't know how people can watch this without having seen the last two seasons. I'm with you here.

Spongebob: It's been way too long to be rewatchable.

Frozenprince: I don't know why, but I'm with you OP.

Septy: That’s a shame. I liked seasons 1-3 but I really don’t like the current season.

Vincent Alexander: The last couple seasons were a bit too much for me. I'm down. The Simpsons is my all-time favorite show.
-----
SArcher: I thought the first and second seasons were good, but I'm out.

~!~What is your favorite app? (Android, iOS, Windows)

BAD: Simple question, which one do you think is the best?
I’m not the kind of person to over-inflate my usefulness of anything - if you know what you're doing, what do you mean by it. But I think I’m generally okay with just a simple search engine.
I’m not the kind of person to over-inflate my usefulness of anything.
I really like Spotify because of its unlimited bandwidth, price-wise (it just gives me so many choices for every day with a decent browsing history and an enormous catalog of songs that it's just overwhelming me with too many). I also like the widget system of just showing all my music imaged from there.
I’m also not the kind of person to over-inflate my usefulness of anything.
I just think I like iOS for being simple, having a really clean, easy to use OS without having to install specific apps.
What do you like about iOS?
-----
Heromanz: I like the Music app. It's easy to use and has great integration with most pretty much every damn website I ever visit.
-----
Fliesen: I'm not the type of person to over-inflate my usefulness, and I certainly don't take shortcuts; I don't see them as useful.
I'm a simple man though.
-----
Omegasquash: I wanna know what the best meme is.
-----
EchoChamber: I don't see what the best meme is.
-----
brentech: I'm a simple man too.
-----
Zexion: I use both.
I'm not a very technical person so I don't give a fair vote to ...
-----
Doctoglethorpe: I love how simple it is. 
I just love it.
-----
Fat4all: the main thing I hate about it is that I don’t get to keep my phone next to my urinals
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I like using a third party app. I can just install it on my phone and it works great.

~!~The Ballad of Pooh by Joe Applegate

Carnby: I just saw this on my Facebook feed. What a great piece of storytelling.
I absolutely love ballads. I am dying to see what happens when we have a proper version. I love them all but this one is even more fantastic. 
Share your favorite ballads.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: This song is so good.
-----
Snake Eater: They're ballads in and of themselves, but the crescendos are amazing
-----
Carnby: I love them.
-----


Citizencope: I’ve never heard a good ballad.
-----
KojiKnight: I love ballads. They're just always so played out and the "what is this" part is just one of those things where you can tell, "oh this is what is going on" and the rest is just one long ass boring ass sing-song. 
I mean, the concept is always amazing but I can appreciate them as long as there's actual visuals to the songs. 
This is just my 2 cents.

RoKKeR: DPRK should never be considered a normal political entity. They'd rather be called a Rocket Man than President.

Also, a lot of Disney/Fox TV subscriptions

Z-Beat: I am bored of Star Wars though, as I always thought it was just a series of videos with nothing in particular

BorkBork: My favourite TV show ever.

~!~Is it just me, or is the quality of movies and TV shows so much less for adults than for kids?

Puck Beaverton: I don’t think I have watched more than 4 movies in my entire life. I think I watched about 6 tv shows and 3 movies in adult. I know kids will only appreciate me for watching 8,9 and 2 movies if I’m watching them at home.
I think that’s more due to the fact that I’m an infant. My parents have a very different mentality to me. My parents watched the exact same stuff as my dad all the time. My dad wants to watch stuff as I have a much higher standard of watching. I’m not talking about the quality of the stuff I watch, but the quality of the content it offers. I like to watch stuff in a variety of genres. What I mean is, I’ve watched a variety of movies and TV shows that my dad hasn’t seen since gradechool.
My dad’s show I’ve seen almost every week since before kindergarten. What I mean is that I’m not talking about the quality of the episodes or the quality of the writing or the cinematography. I’m talking about quality of the writing of the episodes or the visuals or the narrative. I mean, I don’t know that the quality of the TV shows and movies that my dad watches are not because they are more often watched live during dinner time or in the theater. I mean, I like to watch what I’ve seen.
I mean, my father does not like to watch TV during the week. He watches a lot of comedy shows and then just watches what he can get and that’s that.
I just can’t relate to the desire for quality television television, especially when it comes to TV shows.
-----
Dishwalla: what is it with kids or is it that they don't care about the quality of the television we watch?
-----
SugarNoodles: Adults aren’t stupid or stupid kids are.
-----
M52B28: I think it's the same thing, that way you don't need to worry about things in a way where the quality gets undermined by the lack of kids watching.

~!~What's the Most Fucking Terrible Thing You've Done?

Bobo Dakes: I just had this conversation with my sister this morning. I've done a lot of outside road trips lately, which have been more or less great. When I was a teenager living in the North East, we went to some amusement parks in the East coast, but I'm not sure where it is now. 
We've been to Seoul a couple of times, but it was basically a weekend trip. It was the first time in my life without going to certain places. I mean, it's a huge city, but I've never been to Seoul myself. 
Has anyone had any bad encounter/problem?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Driving my car into a bar. Rides back home for the time being.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Going to a Christmas party at home. It was a horrible experience, and the booze was a disgrace.
-----
Vex: Going to a party before yesterday. There was a whole bunch of guys in a car heading to the bar that got all belligerent and stupid. It was a fucking torture.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I never went to a Christmas party, but I've been to shows before and I don't know how many people were seated. I got a good seat, but I was a bit tired. 
I got a good seat, but I was a bit tired. 
I just got into a car with a friend that is used to having road trips around LA. I had to get between two parked cars, but I ended up going over to the car while as I waited for the exit ramp to clear. 
The ramp was a mess, but the ramp was pretty clean, so I don't think anyone even cared. But this happened, and it hurt like hell, because the ramp is fucking wide and the bar was a short walk away. 
I gave up, and then this shit got serious. I'm a fucking idiot.
-----
Bobo Dakes: That's not really a roadtrip...

Hollywood Duo: Going to a bbq in Vegas once. It was so bad I remember going in just to vomit.

I wonder if they’ll go with this global release rather than a single movie internationally.
UPDATE:
On a side note, I'm not sure how I feel about Aquaman all 3 films have been announced so far (Sailor Moon and Atlantis) I feel they'd do a worse in that case.

~!~Why aren't the largest countries doing more to help Africa?

Cryptosporidium: The fact that Africa is so far behind other countries in how to tackle the migration crisis is ridiculous. I know we have a lot of issues in the world but I believe the continent is in a much better place than other places to live today than it was back in the late 20s/early 30s. 
There is no reason for the continent to not be doing more to help the people of Africa. It has been done for many years before, but this latest episode in the episode was the first to really blow me away.
-----
Monodi: I am not sure what you are asking is why we don't do more in the same manner in other countries. You may feel that we are doing less but I think you are just overreacting the situation.
-----
The Albatross: It's pretty clear that the world is better off because we're doing more, because it allows more people to flourish. As a result, more people who are "obsure" or "obsessive" or "perceived" to society are attracted to the traits of the continent more than the ones who live on it, and everyone's "perception" of the "world" changes to match that of the "world" and this makes it easier for that perception to hold true.
Here in the United States, that's not really a thing, but it's not something that's impossible, and certainly in many ways, it's our way of living, and it's easy for people to take advantage of it.
-----
MopDog: I'm not sure I understand what you're asking, but I'm not American and I've lived in other countries and I don't think I've ever had to move when I was younger. I grew up in a rural area, but had no idea how Africa's social changes were going. 
The reason is simple: this is a world where migration is heavily regulated by central governments and is driven by a lack of competition. The people who move the fastest move money into the "goods" rather than move on, which in turn means that the workers moving the least money in turn get more jobs. This is very different in the west.

~!~Best movie commentary?

Daffy Duck: So, I think I have a lot of questions but I'm going to try to keep this short.
I'll begin with my own thoughts of:
-The movie itself is one of the best that I've seen. I think I picked it because I was bored and didn't want the movie to end.
-The dialogue is very clever and funny.
-The movie is very long.
-The themes are very deep.
-The film's two leads are very well cast.
-The movie's conflicts are very deep.
-The audience is very well presented.
What are some other movies that speak to you?
-----
Medalion: Film: Fury Road
TV: Terminator 2
I don't think it's a bad movie, but it's not the best movie in the franchise.
-----
Daffy Duck: Wait, what?
It's a TV movie? I never watched it.
-----
Cybersai: TV:
Gotham
Gotham is ridiculous. None of the dialogue is any different then the other movies, with any level of intelligence.
Movie: The Thing.
But my point is, it's pretty good. The mix of actors is just as good as the original movie.
-----
Daffy Duck: Oh, it's a movie? What is it?
-----
Rassilon: I like it a lot, but it isn’t the best movie in the franchise.
-----
Rackham: A Serbian Film. It's a good movie.
-----
Daffy Duck: What?
I just watched the first two movies. The dialogue is very funny, I love the other movies as well, they're very different than the one about the forest.

There are hundreds of thousands of cancerous brain cells in the body that are performing vital functions far longer than scientists thought, yet the brain is still left to take up the remaining "benreaty" made with cancer to justify the closure of the "end" of the world.

Season 1 was pretty fun, all the seasons are amazing.

-----
TheSkullPrince: I’ll take Rizzo, but like season 1 it was just really dull and cliched.
-----
Mavis: I think the season 1 final season is pretty good, though I don't remember season 2 being that good. I know it's been renewed for season 2, I think they just rushed it out.
-----
henhowc: pretty bad but this.
-----
Griselbrand: I actually enjoyed season 1 more than 2. I don't remember it being that great or really all that different from the seasons that followed.
-----
TheSkullPrince: Season 2 is fucking awesome.
-----
kittens: 4th season is really good but it could be better than season 1 imo.
-----
CaviarMeths: Season 2 is pretty great, but seasons 1 and 2 are a close call.
1 is honestly a masterpiece. 2 is just so much more authentic and it doesn't feel like a "this is good but is a different story than the first season" kinda thing.

~!~Is anyone still using a chromebook?

Josh5890: Wife is a bit of a mess nowadays, and we both have really poor internet, so we're looking for a decent laptop for our needs. Basically, she wants to read PDFs and organize her files, etc. 
Ideally, it would be a desktop PC, so she doesn't need anything too heavy (we want something with a screen, keyboard, mouse, etc), but we can do the bare minimum of work, since that's what she's in for. 
Ideally, we'd be getting something that'd be able to run typical modern web services, like Apt/Patch, etc, and act like a typical web browser. 
Any thoughts?
-----
Captjohnboyd: I've had a chromebook for a few years now. I've also had a Kindle Fire before. Its battery lasts roughly half as long but its battery last about half as much. I would say I would recommend a chromebook, its a bit cheaper and its way faster. Its also an older model so thatsnt a huge deal but if you dont need to do a ton of web browsing, its probably not for you.
-----
Josh5890: I have a Netgear Orbi connect 4k v2 with a keyboard and 4gb ram. Its great.
-----
Jpop: Yes, and yet I don't think I'd be using the Asus with a keyboard.
-----
KojiKnight: Have you considered getting a Chromebook Plus?
-----
Josh5890: No, I don't think I would use the Orbi with a keyboard. It's basically a laptop with the features I want...and not having to carry around a laptop is a big deal to me...so I'd say go for it.
-----
Josh5890: Yeah, I would be avoiding the device since it does look stupidly small when its not meant to be.
Thanks for any tips!
-----
KojiKnight: I'd get one of the cheap ones if I ever wanted to switch over to anything other than a laptop.
-----
Jpop: C'mon. Just sell one for cheaper!

LL_Decitrig: Billionaire Tom Steyer and his team are throwing a party for his executives.
The event, called "Giving the billionaire voice to good ideas", is happening March 24 in Los Angeles, according to people familiar with the matter. It is likely to be a gathering of executives from a wide range of companies and is likely to contain people from a wide range of entertainment and hospitality divisions who are organizing and arranging events for the event.
Mr. Steyer's group has already assembled a number of executives to present a series of talks, according to people familiar with the matter. All of them have put money of their own that could help them avoid paying debts or paying debts, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Income inequality is too high, they say, and a lot of people just aren't happy. Debt is a bigger problem, they say. And the rich won't become as rich as they are otherwise, because inequality is so acute that the rich just want to keep their status.
To get a sense of just how bankrupt a lot of the billionaires in this world are, check out this story from last month. Billionaires and other large investors are now trying to avoid paying debts, fines and jailtime as part of a more radical tax plan.

~!~Do you have a passion for anime these days?

John Doe: I grew up watching anime and watched anime as a kid. I had never been in a mood to watch something that big until recently.
I'm not talking about the gore or the stupid voice acting, I'm talking about the actual expressions and actions you can see in anime.
I'm talking about those weird ass expressions you can see streaming anime productions in on youtube.
Do you have a passion for anime?
-----
Brock Reiher: I'm a sucker for Gengai, but I never watched the entirety of Berserk.
-----
LionPride: I was actually watching the first season of Psycho Pass and saw the name "Nakaba" and thought "that's pretty weird but I like it?"
And I was like "Man, I could've just watched the whole season or two."
But yeah, I was always super into anime, and I watched a lot of anime, but I never got hooked.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I'm a huge Gengai fan, so I've been smoking a huge pipe.
-----
CormoranStrike: I was really into anime in high school but I never got into Gengai as a kid.
-----
Mendrox: I'm 42 and I watched all the amazing anime I could possibly watch as late as elementary school. 
But yes I really enjoyed it. I watched it daily and even bought it all.
-----
Poppy: i always wanted to get into anime as a kid, but like anything it just never happened so i stopped watching it
-----
Tribal24: I grew up watching all the anime in between FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood and MHA RMA Brotherhood. 
I'm not really into Naruto or Berserk, but I've always wanted to start reading up on it
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Anime was a mistake.
I watched anime from shows I used to watch on TV years ago.
-----
Mendrox: Nah I really didn't enjoy it at the time but I did start to wonder why I should still want to watch stuff like Berserk.

~!~Will the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy End With The Phantom Menace or Will A Story To Tell?

TheGamingNewsGuy: While i was watching the new Star Wars movies, i was thinking about the answer of 9/11: Episode 3 or how about 08:19. I have read the book about the 9/11 attacks and it is interesting to say that Episode 3: A New Hope is the ultimate End of The Skywalker Saga but i would like to know which trilogy will end or which one to end. Would it be the end of the current trilogy or will the story be told the same or different?
-----
VectorPrime: Episode 9 will likely be written out of Star Wars when it comes to its story telling. Afterwards it’ll be the prequel trilogy.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I would say yes it will be the end of 9/11 but differing things depending on what the story will be told
-----
shnurgleton: There is no way this trilogy ends with 9/11
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think the 9/11 attacks would be a big sell out to the general audience so they would end there
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: 9/11 is always going to be the last trilogy, it's ending is a big deal in and of itself
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The answer to this question is probably either ending or at the least some degree of end
-----
Drewton: When will Disney take a break after this trilogy ends?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Possible a trilogy ending is how Episode 9 ends but there may not be a second trilogy
-----
Hollywood Duo: I doubt it will end. They will likely retcon it.

~!~How do you deal with bad posture?

John Doe: I'm not a big guy and I have a bad chest, so I am trying to be a better man.
I'm sitting with my hands up. Standing helps me up when I'm feeling tired or feeling ill.
I have neck and shoulder issues for a while now and I'm having trouble sitting down and focusing.
I feel like I am getting old. And I'm trying to get back to old.
I'm scared to go for a long walk or walk around for fear of falling and falling backwards.
It's been a month since the bad posture and I still have a lot of lingering issues that have been taking over.
Why are you sitting down?
-----
Doober: I'm retired and I don't know how to deal with it. I can't stand straight and stand. I can't stand sitting because I'm pretty tall.
-----
CormoranStrike: I sit for I'm tired and I don't know how, I do, I don't know, I'm doing it wrong.
-----
sphagnum: Look for something to ease your stomach.
-----
honest_ry: sitting down is terrible.
Squeeze your pants and go to a restaurant.
-----
Brock Reiher: I don't get tired and I don't have a problem with it. But I'm not a big guy, I like my chest etc.
-----
CormoranStrike: I'm not a big guy I don't need to be. I don't get tired and I don't have to be in a hurry I don't get it.
-----
FUME5: I sit for 45 minutes on a single desk with little to no distractions.
-----
sphagnum: I don't get tired and I don't get ill. I do get tired sometimes but I don't get ill.
-----
Mizzourah: Yep, that's how I've been able to manage it since I was a kid. I sit for 45 minutes, sometimes longer, and then I slowly walk around / run for 20 minutes. One time I got so tired I got a sore throat.

~!~I'm really into the anime The Big Lebowski

It reminds me a lot of Gauche.
-----
Hail Satan: I liked it a lot. It's a good and entertaining show with a good cast.

-----
Wein Cruz: The voice acting was pretty good.
-----
The Driver: I liked it a lot. The premise was interesting and I’d like to see more Doraemon in it.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: It was good. It was too messy for adults and too much for me.
-----
Dale Copper: I watched it a few months ago and enjoyed it.
-----
HStallion: It's pretty much the entire cast of Doraemon.
-----

Masquerade Overture: I've been meaning to check this podcast out for a long time now.
I got the idea for this alternate ending from the last two podcasts that came out.
-----
sphagnum: It's pretty great.

Transistor: It was the best show on the radio I've ever heard. I watched all 3 episodes I believe.
-----
jwk94: Somewhat funny, but the alternate ending was too real for me. I'm glad the alternate ending was the chosen one, I'm a sucker for it.

Masquerade Overture: I'm glad the twist didn't make it into the final episode, but then I wish we had a more solid ending.

Dysun: Still the best thing on the Left

~!~Will the 'O' situation ever end?

Deleted member 1258: This is the question that should have been asked, but I'm pretty sure the answer is no. This was inevitable given the current state of politics.
As we've seen from the recent election, a lot of people were 'complicit' in votes and there's a lot of smoke-dust around.
In 2016, there were reports that Comey was basically going to end the investigation, and it's become clear that the entire government was involved in the effort.
In 2016, Comey also wrote in his letter that the investigation was 'deeply problematic', but at this point, it's pretty clear that no decision has been made on whether or not to pursue charges. Even if Trump has been indicted, the obstruction of justice scandal will go away with the current administration.
I have this sinking feeling that humanity is about to collectively tank in a sea of death and death until that day will be finally upon us.
-----
Krejlooc: I saw a report on Facebook and it's like, what the fuck. It's really fucking sad.
-----
Krejlooc: I mean, I don't think the obstruction charges against Trump will ever be on file in the grand scheme of things, so it's not like charges were never filed. But even if they were, I don't think we'll have a world where the scandal is going to come eventually and that's not a huge wishyosh.
-----
Krejlooc: If you're going to say that this is 'painful' but I could see it being great, is there a reason why you're not even considering that there's a problem with this? Because even if Trump's pardon pardon would have been a goldmine, if they were still planning to move on, then I just don't think it's a great idea.
-----
Krejlooc: It's not like there is a problem with that. The pardon itself would have been a goldmine. The pardon itself is a fucking sham, and there is no need for serious investigation into it.
-----
reKon: What is this thread?

Its a little low on the ctick, but its still a great paper. I rolled my eyes when watching the news when it started but I wasnt quite sure how accurate it was till today. And then I realized its a little paper called "Nrasilaknivn" which is a grammaticaly bit confusing but sounds like a youtuber or something.

I just had a call with my boss. I had a really bad runny nose that I had in a several weeks. I'm so tired and I feel like I'm falling asleep.
I'm waking up, just a little bit after I go to sleep. I'm struggling to get up from bed. 
I don't think I can do anything about it. I just want to go sleep again.

I don't know why. I watched the movie, and I thought I was fucking up, but that's nothing compared to what I'm going to have to deal with tomorrow. I'm in my mid 40's, and I've never had any kind of problem with anyone. I've been sober for over a decade now, and I'm proud of it.
I'm not sure what I'm going to do or how I'm going to deal with this. I just feel like taking a break from life for a few days to come up with something to distract myself and work on my self esteem is a great idea.
