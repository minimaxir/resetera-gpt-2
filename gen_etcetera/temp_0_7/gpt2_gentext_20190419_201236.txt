~!~What Are the Insights of the Original Star Wars TV Series?

TheGamingNewsGuy: For those who are not aware - the TV Series is a tv series by Lucasfilm studio and it is the tv series about the Great Galactic War between the Empire and the Rebellion between the two factions. It is set around Lando, a young Han Solo, Lando's grandpa Rolo and a sentient Lando as well as Chewbacca. It is set in the early days of the Galactic age and is considered by many to be a prequel to the OT and is also considered by many to be a sequel to the OT after Revenge of the Jedi. 
What are the aspects of this series that you are a fan of and what do you think is the main Insights Series?

TheGamingNewsGuy: I am sure some of the questions asked above have been answered

TheGamingNewsGuy: Well its a prequel to the OT
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: And yes some of the series are plotlines that are not explored in the OT

TheGamingNewsGuy: Also I am aware some of the questions asked above are riddles that are answered in the OT
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Thanks for the answers -
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Also I am aware some of the questions asked above are in the OT

TheGamingNewsGuy: Thank you

Deleted member 11093: I wouldn’t mind a prequel to the OT since the OT isn’t even half as interesting as the OT prequel.

Hollywood Duo: This country is desperate.

But yes. That is a funny thing.

This is great news to me, as it goes to show that these Browns are getting a good team in the market that's willing to pay their players.

WereSalamander: Losing a coach that's not awful, a good coach that's not terrible, and a good team that's happy with their new coach.

NinjaScooter: He's a former Bear who was fired, not Jackson.

Rocket Schnauzer: Jackson is still a Bear? From his role in the whataboutism team I'm guessing he's not part of that scheme?

Personally, I think he's more impressive than many others, but I think he is a bit capricious as a player, and it's not a bad look, especially at a time where we can get players like Dwight Howard, Kobe Bryant, etc.
What are some other moments in professional sports where you think that Kobe is on fire when he has it right?

~!~Marvel Studios dramatically underworks Disney's Mary Poppins sequel

wenis: Source
It's difficult to overcompensate for marvels, but the movies overall just aren't fun to watch. The fact that they can't make whatever they want out of their own IP makes them less interesting to me.
-----
Timbuktu: It's basically Disney but with characters they've known for decades.
-----
BlackJace: It's a shame. I liked the first one a whole lot.
-----
Slayven: I am thinking about giving it a look. It looks like the first one was inspired by a She-Ra plot.
-----
AlexFlame116: I like Mary Poppins, but I'm really not into it.
I'm not the most cinematic person but I've seen the first one about nine times and I have the least patience for them.
I know they can't do the original Green Lantern, but I don't know if they'd make the movie about Superman and the original version of Mary Poppins.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I am very very much against this.
I'll watch whatever they do, but I know that it won't be very good.
-----
Timbuktu: I don't think Disney should overcompensate for a shoddy sequel. It wouldn't make sense for them to do, since the premise is the same as the original, and they aren't going to make a sequel for it.
-----
Sly Chimera: Nope, the first one was pretty good and the original one was pretty boring.

HStallion: I like it but it would be cool if they did a sequel to the first one to tie things together.

I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't like the theme of this movie. Liked the number of characters that were actually at least decent. 
I wish we never had to see what the author had to say about this movie.

John Dunbar: i was about to say that i didn't care for it at all but i guess i gotta give it a try.

TheBeardedOne: It's a fun thriller, and has some cool elements to it.
I was very bored in it, and found it very boring.
-----
NarohDethan: Not exactly a movie anyone should watch, but it was enjoyable.
-----
Ferrs: The story is interesting. It is not as lit and thrilling as the source books, but it is entertaining.
I love the subtitle and the theme is easily one of the best themes in any language.
-----
Nathan_Drake: The original book was pretty lit.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's very light and uninspired, and that's the biggest problem.

It's not that I finished it. I did like how the story is told, but it was really messy and not memorable.

~!~Does anyone have a good (or at least recommended) streaming/backup system?

Fiction: I've been tinkering with different back-ups over the past year or so, but I'm starting to learn that I don't really want to spend time troubleshooting them. No matter how smart I realize how dumb I'll get when I try to get them to fall asleep.
Do I need a basic phone/tablet?
A basic phone/tablet is going to need to power up at least one person. My current one can only function one way (and the other person can only function similarly), so I'm thinking of just getting a wifi router, add another layer of protection, and then maybe a NAS. Basically, I just want to use a WiFi router as my primary one (and a NAS for that, if I need it). But I don't know how to backup my data/what to do after it expires.
So I need to start with a wifi router that comes with a bunch of built in support (like APRS-1000/Garlo and APRS-500), and some support (like A-Tens). I don't know what's best, maybe a cheap one that works and has good signal. Then I have to start using the cloud (or something I can just copy/paste down from APRS-1000) to back up the data.
I don't have a solid idea on what best to get, but I'd like to get some good suggestions.
Currently I'm using the Google Authenticator for OkCupid which seems to work well. I'm using OkCupid's S3 method. I'm using the same password for each service so I can create a chain of fuckers.
What's the best out there?
I'm not 100% sure what I should be getting for a good offering. If there are better services out there I'd appreciate it but I'm afraid of losing out on something good. 
Any advice?
-----
Trojita: Can't you just put it on APRS?
-----
Fiction: I think I'll just have to wait for the OkCupid to fully charge it's data. I'm planning on going with a Layer3 password manager, which is what I'm really looking for.

Wilsongt: I don't think he's trying to rile up the base to his boner.
-----
EdibleKnife: That's a bold strategy. If he's prepared for the test, he's prepared to face any backlash from nuclear powers. I think Russia knows its own shit and is prepared to test it. And Trump is prepared to be tested by his own people as well as by other nations.

Dio Over Heaven: It's gotta be that time of year, for a couple of weeks or so, and I'm studying some political science. I was waiting for the Hangout on the topic of the Soviet Union's "don't look at us" meme. I'm not really interested in political science but I was fairly late on the communist train and I read a bit about the meme's origin - so I'm kind of interested in what it means for the group as a whole, and I plan to have a look into it.
But I'm from the USA, so I'm not sure how or why I got the "don't look at us" meme. I think I read the article that explains why, but I can't find any other news articles on this topic I could be too lazy to search for. I just want to discuss my opinion on the meme for now, and maybe get a few things to add to my overall studying/schwifty on the subject.
Thanks!

LeleSocho: Was it the 90's that sparked the greatest wave of high school nostalgia?
I remember the 90's were a pretty big turning point in American culture.

skeptem: The early 2000s was a big turning point for the "entertainment culture."

~!~The Season of Magic: The Gathering

Edmond Dantès: Plot overview (1-8)
Concept art (1-1.5)
The group of 5 have assembled a big team to plan the next seasons of Magic. As we have so little progress so far, we're bringing together some of our favourite players and newcomers for this upcoming season (all with high level of play, no need to be a super dedicated group, just a group of interested people interested in trying to plan out a Magic tournament).
The players will be drawn from a pool of currently playing players assembled by Patrick M Brocken, a famous pro history teacher. He knows a lot about Magic, too, and has published some of his stories or books on Magic with Brandon Sanderson.
Since the starting group decides to punt everything away and draft, we'll be covering every set of Magic cards this group will be covering this season.
The format:
1 Player drafted (2-6) Magic: the Gathering (7) Magic: the Gathering (8) Magic: the Gathering (9) Magic: the Gathering (10) Magic: the Gathering (11)
The format is similar to the Shadowrun Campaign, but with an opening weekly tournament at the end of the month.
Formatting OT: 
2 Player drafted (9-12) Magic: the Gathering (10-11) Magic: the Gathering (12-14) Magic: the Gathering (15-17) Magic: the Gathering (18-20)
The starting player is a 4th player, the Lord Commander (or DM), and he/she represents the 5th player. They each get one point from each new player each session.
The starting player then has to choose which magic card to put onto the ritual list. If they do, then the first one that's on the ritual list represents that new player. If they choose a ritual card that's not on the list, they're in the ritual list. If they choose a specific card, their contribution goes on the list and bonus pts. If they choose no, then that player gets 1 point per card they play on the ritual list. If there's a bonus, bonus card or whatever they choose is put on the list and bonus pts. If there's none, then that player gets zero points.
The starting ritual player gets points based on what's in the ritual list put on the front of the

~!~What's the best way to watch/read the BBC Play version of Sherlock?

MosquitoSmasher: I recently discovered this app and i'm wondering what the best way to watch the BBC Play version of Sherlock to my computer is. I've read this app is missing the BBC's version and I'm wondering which version are you guys talking about and why is it missing the BBC version? 
I'm watching this version with the BBC version on the Amazon app with no BBC missing it. It's a fantastic app that is enjoyable to look over and not confusing the computer with bad content. 
I've read that the BBC's version is missing the BBC's radio voiceovers and the BBC's version is the BBC audio voiceovers. 
Any help would be great as I'm using the BBC version on the BBC site without having to watch it.
-----
Yossarian: I’ve used the BBC version of the app. I’ve found the voiceover in the Play version to be better, but other than that, the BBC version is fine.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: I just want the BBC version to be better than the BBC radio version.

~!~The best Super Smash Bros. characters?

Bman94: I'm trying to find the best examples of the best characters and I'm trying to find the best examples of the best Super Smash Bros. characters. I figured it would be a good idea to make a list of all the best examples of the best characters, preferably with a time window of 5-7 years per episode. So the main idea is that this list will be expanded to cover all the current games, as well as the animated series, as the top-tier examples of the characters from the best games. I'll start with the main character, Mario.
Mario, as a character, is a simple man. All his moves are based on his sense of smell. His sense of taste, however, is incredibly strong. This means that as soon as he hears a particular noise, he doesn't makes a living on his sense of smell. This is a character with a strong sense of smell, but he doesn't know how to properly process it. Mario is a mascot for his time. He speaks with a strong sense of smell, but he doesn't know how to process it. He speaks in a particular accent though, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. He's from another country by the village's name, as well as not his own. And as a mascot, Mario is more experienced. He can often be found playing in the village by himself, which is rare, but he can still recognize him and be able to recognize his various moves. Mario is more of a human than a mascot, but he also gets recognised for that. He is also a mascot for his age at the age of 11.
Mario is a very strong character, so it's a bit surprising that he's not more well known and widely known. I guess I'm not surprised that he's more well known. Mario is also more well-known than a character, but he's still very much a character. Mario is a truly special character, but I guess that's because Mario is the one that everyone knows about and shares his strong sense of smell.
Now a few things that I didn't really get across. Mario is very much a character, so I can understand why he's not more well known. But he's also very much a unique character, so I guess that makes him more well known than others. Mario's sense of smell is not a secret, but it is a very real one

Gernau Morat Gurgeh: What's the NHS about?

Dan: I'm sorry if the title is a bit rambling, but the title is sounding like a fucking TV show.

UnpopularBlargh: I think it's about the current lack of transparency in the NHS.
-----
John Caboose: Ah yes, it’s about the sudden shut down and re-opening of the NHS by the Tories.

UnpopularBlargh: I think it's about the Tories having a gofundme to buy video games for my kid.

~!~Hangouts for Comics Recommendations?

MMarston: It's that time of year and my favorite part of the city is officially ruined by the fall unrest.
So I'm trying to get into comics again, and it's giving me a bit of a run down of the road. As I write this I've picked up a lot of Superman: The Animated Series and I'm running out of places to start.
I've always liked these covers of Dune by Andy Garcia-designs as a way to provide a sense of the history and the characters brought to life through the art.
Any advice ERA, or anyone who has any kind of comics recommendation would be happy to share?
-----
LionPride: I've been reading a lot of American Gods lately, and I've always liked the aesthetic and the writing is just just really good

Puck Beaverton: Only way to enjoy a good book is as a dumb fanboy

MisterHero: You should at least check the Harry Potter books for one page.

~!~Is it possible to rewatch Star Wars: The Last Jedi?

Coyote Starrk: I have a lot of questions about it. I am not a big Star Wars fan but I have recently watched A New Hope and I am curious about it as well. Do you also recommend it?
-----
Jpop: No.
-----
Coyote Starrk: I would love to but my search history shows that none of my rewatches of the trilogy have been watched by a mod. I would just prefer to watch it on a fresh start.
-----
MMarston: The only Star Wars I watch on Netflix is The Force Awakens, and I'm 100% certain I've seen the original.
-----
The Almighty Tria: Yes. The only rewatch I ever got around to was The Empire Strikes Back, but I'm not sure if I ever will.
-----
robotrock: Yes.

GrizzleBoy: Only one that comes to mind is The Last Jedi
-----
MMarston: I think I have seen A New Hope and The Force Awakens, and I think that one is fucking good.

Travo: Just rewatched TLJ.

Coyote Starrk: That one is amazing. But I'm trying to get the full rewatch experience.

Metallix87: Hope they get the memo.
-----
BWoog: The fact that they want to make that clear will be significant.
-----
BWoog: You don't get to know if a request goes through that much, and if they actually want to make that clear.
-----

Metallix87: I'm not sure that's entirely true. There's no fucking way to know how many people were being threatened. They likely have to be pretty worried about stuff like mortgage defaults, and will want to make sure that they don't get caught.
-----
Rivenblade: Coincidentally, this is the same fund that is threatening the Trump Foundation, which Trump hired to try and build a fake charity to get a Trump tax refund.

Metallix87: Oh, good Lord. I hope they get the fucking memo.

~!~Has anyone else ever been led to the bottom of a sinking ship?

HomokHarcos: I've lived in depressions for the past few years and I've had to deal with people pulling me into a sinking ship. I've done it multiple times and it's always at the bottom. I've recently been offered a position within my company, but I'm scared as fuck that this person knows more about me than I do and is just going to cruise there and bail out every time.
I'm not sure if I'm just being assholes, or if I'm just being assholes. It's always been a risk I take and I wouldn't want to take it. Anyone else been led to the bottom of a sinking ship?

TheBeardedOne: I've been, and it's a really uncomfortable experience

Eatin' Olives: I've been regularly being led to the bottom of their ship and I've failed

Poppy: i used to work in a building that was underwater and there was a guy who was a manager underneath the boat, and he did a very specific job that had me in the uncomfortable mood of the hangars
i don’t think i’ve ever been to the bottom of a sinking ship

====================
~!~A post from a while back about the time I met a girl...

theofficefan99: I guess it's a bit old but I feel like I only wrote about it a few times, but I feel like I've mentioned this a lot in the past.
I'm not a trans person so I've never really discussed it with anyone, but recently, my gf wanted to know if I knew about her gendered gender at all.
She's been telling me all kinds of fucked up things about me, including how her gendered penis was different to mine and how it was much closer to her.
I feel like I might be trans shaming a whole group of people like my friend, but at the same time I just feel like I'm just making people uncomfortable for no reason.
It's not like I've ever said anything transphobic or even really said anything transphobic about anyone, but I feel like I have since like high school (I turned 18 in a couple weeks ago) and I feel like I can say what I want without anyone really questioning or needing to hear it.
I just wanted to get some side opinions from those that have actually seen it and know what it's like to feel that ambivalent reaction to seeing a trans person.
-----
WillyFive: I think that's the point of trans people being kind of misunderstood. They're not being presented with a choice of looking at Trans or XX person or givenGender, and trying to find the correct one is, as you say, transphobic.
-----
pizoxuat: I think that's a really bad idea to be questioning, I'm not just feeling like I have to see that as well.
I'm not trying to be sexist, I'm just wondering if anyone here who has seen that kind of scenario or has different experiences with trans people can really tell you?
-----
johan: I think we're not inundated with that sort of content, at least from what I have seen. I think people want you to know that they are different
-----
Seesaw15: It's not always about the content. It's about the questions asked of people in the same topic.
-----
The Albatross: Yeah, this. It's not something you want to hear if you're not trans, and it's not always a good idea to be. That's not to say that you shouldn

~!~How will we ever get over Trump's "we're just the one in the world, we're the crazy person in the world" defense?

BlackFyre: As a white, straight male, I've had this sentiment since the elections. 
I'm not even a great believer.
I'm certain many outside of America would benefit from the current administration. I'm sure many others have it too. 
We are the crazy person in the world, trump.
-----
Hours Left: Nope.
-----
Dio: yeah, but i think we're going to have to fight against this future in the next two to three years.
what are the odds of winning?
-----
DrSlek: As an outsider, it's possible but it's not likely we'll ever see a Trump presidency. There are too many odds for a Trump presidency to believe we'll ever get to the point where we'd be in control of the entire country and we will be the crazy person in the next two to three years.
-----
Alucrid: i don't see how you can win against Trump anymore. he's changed, he'll be gone in a few years, and he's not going to be president for a long time.
-----
Taki: Maybe at the same time, he'll leave behind his adopted daughter.
-----
Wag: In the next 20 years, the country will be a crazy place.
-----
Sagadego17: not after he leaves the country!
-----
BlackFyre: Only Trump can change it. Even if he loses the election.
-----
Muppet of a Man: I'm sure the "We are the crazy person in the world, crazy person in the world" defense will still be used. It's much more helpful to point to the real enemies.

~!~Is this the most inaccurate video ever made?

Thewonandonly: So I’m sitting here watching Jan. and Jan. 11’s, most accurate ever made. If this was a real video it would probably turn off their analytics. 
I’m like many others have said this. But what the fuck. They made a 3rd party video and it looks like that is legit and not some hacky algorithm. I need this goddamn video. They even have fake people in the video so why not make a fake vlog? 
I tried to explain to my girlfriend but she’s a dumbass so I think she’s just going through with it or something. What the fuck. This video doesnt even look real to me. Is this the most inaccurate video ever made? 
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong and I feel like I need to do something with my life to make this stop. 
Also what the fuck
-----
Thewonandonly: You can tell my girlfriend that it’s a real video and she thinks I’m just fuckin wowing her. She knows I’m dumb and she thinks I’m taking advantage of her. She is so mad that she thinks I’m trying to pressure her out of something. I’m just so mad she thinks I’m fuckin wowing her.

Chrno: this is great
-----
Slayven: Yes, the AG probably loves the air.

Dishwalla: "keep the air alive" is a pretty non-news statement.

Kirblar: This is a bit of a bicameral way of saying "let us live, not starve, because of the bullshit in the EPA"

Deleted member 9145: Trump is a bad guy

Inuhanyou: Dont expect this to gain traction anytime soon, but it has to do in a way. A lot of people agree with you on that point, but you gotta be willing to let him win an election and then put some real effort into this.

Stinkles: I like the idea of a group of people that isnt willing to let their city shut down because of the unchecked arrogance of the president.

~!~What are your thoughts on 2018?

Mahonay: I've been on a year relationship, 5 years without having kids. And I'm really happy. I have quite a few qualms with the children, but it's only a year out, so I think it's actually improving my life. 
I'm still in the beginning of the process of getting married, but we are currently in the planning stage. We're going to be having a baby in a few months, and we've already started dating, start getting married, and plan to start having the kid in a couple months. We've already set our most recent targets, and he's an awesome dad, and I'm happy that we're going to be able to deliver the child of our love in time for him. 
But I guess I have a few misconceptions.
1. My biggest is that I think my biggest peeve has always been my anxiety and self-loathing with putting our children's dreams away. I get that and think they deserve it. But I feel like I'm doing the right thing here. I'm worried that if I do marry them, I'll be finding out I had a kid too instead of taking her away. And I feel like I will have to take that chance again after they're gone. I'm worried that if I do take them away, they'll all grow into and be an awesome dad to me. I feel like I am just getting the right timing here. 
2. I also have mixed feelings about the thought of taking their kid away for 9 months. I get that it's a pretty normal thing to do, and that at least once they're in a relationship, they're fine. But I feel like I'm just ignoring it. I've never really had a problem with the thought of taking my kids away so I don't know why I do so. 
But I guess I just don't have the right background in how I'm handling these things. I'm getting older and I feel like I make mistakes along the way. So I feel like I kind of become complacent with this. But I can't see myself ever learning from it. Or do I do it?
-----
Pickman: As someone who has never had a problem with kids, I have mixed feelings on taking my kid away. They're there for the parent, not for me. I don't think the idea of taking my kid

~!~Android is a pain in the ass

NineConsonants: Ain’t nobody got time for this shit. 
I’ve been using Android for a long time now and I’ve never had an issue seeing ads. The only thing I’ve had an issue with is using the ad blocker. Is that a true pain in the ass? I’m constantly being blocked with extensions and I just had this weird “this ad is sponsored by me” whenever I open my browser. 
If I just switch to Chrome and disable the extension I’m fucked. 
Anyone else have this problem? 
I’m on a diet and I’ve been having these issues for the last month now. I’m on a low-effort app, it really doesn’t help. 
I just want to know if anyone else had this same problem, and if you have any suggestions?
Edit:
I’m at work, so no YouTube Red support.
-----
linkboy: Chrome.
I also use Opera as a browser and that works great.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Why not just use Chrome?
-----
NineConsonants: I only use Chrome because I work on a site where I’m not a frequent user, so I just use the default ad blocker.
-----
KojiKnight: Chrome for me.
-----
Duane: Chrome works great for me. I've had issues with ads in the past where certain sites would show ads that weren't coming anywhere with ads on them, so I've been using it a lot. It's not for everyone, but for regular browsing use and not bothering with extensions, it works great.
-----
NineConsonants: That would be the first one I know of that doesn’t have a built in ad blocker. I’m using it for a few things. 
The "install site" option doesn’t have a built in ad blocker. 
I just wanna get some peace of mind.
-----
Mendinso: I've had the same issue. It seems to be specifically caused by the youtube app being blocked.

~!~As an ex-gay, I'm scared of the unknowns.

Chance Hale: I was diagnosed with Gender Dysfunction 2 years ago. It's easy to latch onto the outside of the legal system, but hard to keep up with when you're not understanding what's bothering you. It's a shame because being able to break out of the system seems like a huge privilege and I'm sure it's a great opportunity to become non-binary for a better chance at better opportunities.
I have a few issues with functioning within a system. The kind that can be dealt with by a broken or mentally ill system is hard to get outside of. I have issues with stress, anxiety, and depression. I'm currently dealing with a broken shoulder, which takes me a while to get over and aching much too. I'm also overweight and as a gay myself I don't really know how to function.
I'm maybe a year from diagnosis and over half my past life is probably spent at the therapist or in the relationship, which is a pretty long experience. I'm also a complete mess here and there and I'm wondering if I'm going down a path that will have me struggle with self-esteem issues, depression and suicidal thoughts.
Does anyone else deal with this issue in some capacity? I don't know how to help it but I'm scared to look for help because I honestly don't know where to start.

John Kowalski: Bout, what the fuck?

Reeks: I've been in therapy. It's hard, but yes I'm not perfect. I'm not sure I get it. But if you can identify it and get an assessment then you can get a bit more out of it than a therapy session.

~!~Showers

CormoranStrike: Just got my shower, so early to go to bed so I'm early for work, I'm probably going to feel the shower today anyway.
Anyway, after shidding my shower I go to the sink. It's a nice warm and a good clean one, but I'm still feeling the dampness. The shower is a bit messy, and it feels like there's a lot of juice in it, but I'm still feeling it. I then go into the shower and the water is already running in. I then spend the next hour or so in the shower, shoving the water in and running it through my body. It's nice and hot, but I still feel the dampness.
Anyway, how often do you visit your partner shower? Why are you a morning person and why are you a "shower guy"?

Smurf: this is my shower

Squarehard: I'm sure this is the logical conclusion to draw.
-----
The Alpah: That was a pretty obvious line.
-----
Dishwalla: I don't mean to be that guy, but this is some sort of talking point.
-----
bremon: “It’s not just jobs, it’s about the economy.”
-----
Kthulhu: Why would Trump think it's a bad thing to talk about the economy if you're saying that the economy is the biggest it has been in the last thirty years?
-----
TerminusFox: Its almost like he’s a cognitive surgeon that sees the consequences of his actions before anyone in the process can make sense of it all.

~!~What is the best way to watch all the old episodes of The Simpsons?

TheBeardedOne: I'm trying to find a way to watch all of the episodes that started as "The Giger" and have been removed because they were old and no longer available. I'd like to watch some new episodes, but I don't know what the best way is.
I've seen clips of the episodes in question but can't find them anywhere online.
I've seen clips of the episode and they're on YouTube, but can't find them on YouTube.
I've also seen clips of the current episodes, but can't find them on YouTube.
-----
Pirate Bae: The Giger is too long.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Thanks, I'll look at it.
-----
TheBeardedOne: A couple of years ago when I was watching the Giger and I think I watched Seasons 3-5, but I remember it being pretty funny.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Thanks, look it's the second one I saw. I don't remember much.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Thanks, I'll look through them.

-----
FireSafetyBear: Love it
-----

BAN PUNCHER: That was my thought.

ElectricBlanketFire: The creators of Scream Queens.
-----
Neece: Scream Queens is a terrible movie.

ImperatorPat: Saw it on the vhs recommended app a few weeks back. It was scary.

LilWayneSuckz: Saw it on the recommended app and it was scary.
-----
Furiousone: My wife and I were watching it when we saw it on the news as well.
-----
RoninChaos: I saw it a few days ago and I was like "what the fuck?" To be fair, I'm not talking about the message. I'm talking about the cast.

~!~2017 has been a good year for horror movies

More_Badass: Although 2017 saw the release of the first Halloween movie this year, I wasn’t too into the franchise itself. This year has been very good for horror films, not just the Halloween ones that we’ve seen before. The best one thusfar has been the surprisingly good Cloverfield, and it’s the one that qualifies as a horror film.
What other horror movies have you been able to watch off and on and on and over the course of a year?
-----
HStallion: Horror films are a dime a dozen again.
-----
Grannvale: I only watched the first one a few months ago and it was pretty good. I should go back and watch the rest, I haven't seen them all since they split off from the original in the second movie.
-----
ZackieChan: I'm not gonna lie, I didn't really enjoy the original Halloween. I think I might have given the original a chance.
And I don't think I watched the VHS version of The Nightmare Before Christmas.
-----
More_Badass: Horror movies have generally been more low budget, low budget and low budget these days
-----
Bumhead: I thought The Conjuring was great.
Then again, I don't think I watched Frank Welts and Three Billboards.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I was on a terrible acid trip and I saw The Conjuring
-----
SlasherMcGirk: The only one I really enjoyed was Freddy Got Fussy.
-----
Watership: I thought it was great. It had a lot of horror elements in common with the original.
-----
trikster40: My wife loved The Conjuring as well. I watched it in the theater and enjoyed it.

~!~What are the best wireless headphones?

Vanillalite: So I've been looking around for some wireless headphones that don't require any special equipment yet. I've been a big fan of the Sony Vegas G Pro wireless headphones. Anything that doesn't require any special equipment is a fantastic deal. I would definitely consider the G Pro but I have always wanted to get a wireless one.
What are the best wireless headphones?
-----
Transistor: Sony Vegas?
-----
Dirt McGirt: Sony MDX650
-----
Nerfgun: I want Sony MDX750
if you don't mind my asking
-----
PSqueak: i like the Panasonic MS-LERT headphones.
-----
FireSafetyBear: Reverbless.
-----
Mcfrank: I’ve been using the Sony Vegas for years. Works like a charm. Works great.
-----
Reuben: LG UP970. 
Didn't need special equipment or anything. Low latency. Gets the job done. Gets full speed for a full day at full volume.
-----
Nerfgun: Yes. It's pretty good.
-----
MrKlaw: They’re not that great but I’d still say the Sony buds hold their value.

~!~The best dubs I've ever watched

NTGYK: I'm watching the original Japanese versions of The Legend of the Galactic Heroes dubbed for the first time. I'm watching the seasons I think?
The original version is amazing with a major focus on the space war and how it relates to Goku and Vegeta. I've also never seen an english dub of a manga before, so I'm curious if anyone has any other good dubs out there.
-----
Gundam: I love Space War.
I also watched the dub of Dragon Ball Super's dub.
It's good.
-----
MMarston: It's one of the best.
-----
Gundam: Here it is.
-----
MMarston: Finished it. The one where Goku and Vegeta go to study together and fight the tyrant race.
-----
MMarston: Battle of the Gods and Space War are up there with Cowboy Bebop for me.
-----
Gundam: You're welcome
-----

MMarston: Just finished both!
Glad to see more Dragon Ball :)
But seriously, I love both.
-----
Gundam: Battle of Gods is GOAT tier DBZ.

Trojita: I know, but I didn't even know they were doing this.

Tagyhag: That's some good news. That's some good news.
-----
Idolvo: I can't imagine this amount of screen space for a basic sim card would increase the battery.
-----
CormoranStrike: Why not just use your phone?
-----
Trojita: They're not saying this, but the idea that you can't get this is ridiculous.
-----
Infinity Times Two: Not even a hint.
-----
Trojita: They're saying this, but hardly their intention.

xxracerxx: This. Not even. This is just a stealth marketing ploy.

Trojita: No details. What kind of phone though?

Trojita: The inner workings of Oneplus.

Briarios: That's not how any normal person would vote.
-----
Kurdel: They are all lying, and all, like, three-hundred years ago, and they're all, like, twelve-year-olds.
-----
Deleted member 46641: That's not how it works. They are all, like, twelve-year-old, who's, like, really old.
-----
Ginta: They are taking it too far.
-----
Grizzel Greedigut: Not a good sign.

FriskyCanuck: During his interview on CNN, Trump said he voted for Clinton:

~!~What are your favorite modern Simpsons episodes?

ElectricBlanketFire: Long as I'm not going to lie, I'm liking the episodes here.
For me, I'll give any show a season. The three hit after The Life of Brian is my favorite of them.
-----
Okabe: The Life of Homer
Season one of the classic sitcoms, which is still my favorite.
-----
Einchy: I'm not a big Simpsons guy but Season 1 of the Wire is probably my favorite.
-----
Airegin: Simpsons Vs Futurama
Season one of the underrated Family Tiles.
-----
Powdered Egg: My favorite of the three.
-----
shnurgleton: The Dick Diaries and Monday Night Football are the most memorable episodes.
edit: The Dick Diaries is probably my favorite episode of any show
-----

Einchy: The trend continues.

ElectricBlanketFire: I don't think there's a season 5 of The Listening Mind

~!~[LAist] The Intercept: The United States Is Secretly Worried About Its Own Immigration Laws

KSweeley: The United States is Secretly Worried About Its Own Immigration Laws: 
The article is dated July 22, 2018 and it's worth further reading:
-----
Hiphopopotamus: Donald Trump is our closest neighbor. He has a genius idea for how to deal with climate change.
-----
Wilsongt: Sooner or later the US will have to apologize to the world.
-----
Kirblar: The US has an unwavering military and intelligence relationship with the UK.
-----
Kthulhu: The US is not a country to be feared by its citizens.
-----
muteKi: This is the mentality of every Republican who contributes to the military industrial complex
-----
Thebeast!: The US does not fear its own regulations. It doesn't need to be afraid of its own regulations. US has a reputation for being one of the good guys so why would the UK need to fear their own regulations?
-----
Wilsongt: The US and Canada are, effectively, in the same league.
-----
Titik: This is what happens when the US goes from a moral leader to a bully.
-----
RoyaleDuke: I'm not even Canadian, but I have to say, the US has an unwavering military and intelligence relationship with the UK.

~!~Anyone who is a fan of the One Piece dub has the love sucked into their own One Piece album?

PSqueak: I just randomly tweeted out to my GF and told her I really liked the dub, and she's right.
I didn't realize this was a One Piece topic until I started digging into the new album, but I noticed that my album artwork can be a bit...off.
Like, I can barely type perfect letters. I can fl ink letters, and barely type letters. I can type letters like "hello, gm," and just sit and stare at it for like 5 minutes.
My artwork is so....off that I wonder if I really enjoyed the original.
I just randomly found the new artwork, and I couldn't tell if I actually disliked my artwork or if it was just me trying to troll my GF.
I mean, I guess...I guess it could be fun, but....
Anyone else have this problem?
-----
AnansiThePersona: I'm a fan of the original series, so I'm not surprised. It's a hobby for sure.
-----
sibarraz: I don't really get this
Like, weird example, you read One Piece; the art is all weirdly colorless, so I don't think it's a big deal
-----
PSqueak: I guess I am not complaining about my artwork, but I don't think this is a big deal, lol.
-----
A Wild Ambulance Appears: I've never been a fan of One Piece.
-----
FireWarrior: im sure the original series has had it's artwork do share the sentiment of the manga
-----
Rob: I've never been a fan, but I'll always appreciate some artwork from the series. I always thought the original art was awful, terrible, and I wanted to never read the manga.
-----
John Doe: It really is a strange addiction.
I don't think I've ever been a fan of any manga besides One Piece.
-----
Slayven: I can't tell if I have or don't have the addiction. I just read the manga and it's like the whole addiction is just a filler thing.
-----
MistaTwo: I don’t get it.

====================
~!~Criminal Justice Reform: Aight.

Mr.Mike: I've always been a big proponent of those two books. The books have gone through a lot of rewrites, but I'm genuinely curious on the greater historical significance of those two books, and I can't think of a more succinct example of it being used (the context with the criminals he trusts) to rehabilitate a population when the US is a prison society and a clear rip-off. Particularly interesting in the context of today's gun culture and the general politicization of the US prison system.
Thoughts?
P.S.
A quess of the original authorship is always helpful, especially if you can be cast as the original not the revisionist version.
-----
shnurgleton: I'll never understand how a criminal Justice Reform book rehabilitates a society
-----
H.Protagonist: I read the book and I'm stunned at the book's accuracy.

~!~Does anyone have any advice on how to consume lean protein?

TheFallenSaboteur: It's been hard for me to find a quality lean protein source, but I found this one in Google recipes:
I also found this one in all the Google recipes I tried. I'm curious how others feel about this.
-----
CormoranStrike: I don’t eat much protein, but I do eat some lowfat milk. It’s pretty good.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I've never used a source based on this, but according to the recipe in the linked post it works! 
I'm curious how others feel.
-----
shira: It's not as rare as you think it is, in fact if the protein is as much pure as the fat is, the fat will dissolve in the muscle and you should be fine.
-----
VectorPrime: I've been doing this for years but I've never heard of someone using it.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I usually eat a single serving of this in my normal life (40 lbs). I'm in a great mood for lean protein. It has never failed me though. I also don't eat too much fast in general. I used to eat 2 meals a day, but that's reduced to 1 meal per week now.
-----
MrChom: It's not rare but I've heard that if you're consuming enough protein that you end up with a lot of muscle. Also, I know I eat too much protein and it makes me fat.
-----
Woolley: I eat a nutrient-rich diet, but it has never made me fat.
-----
Dennis8K: It is called "fat free" or "full fat".
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Oh, the former. I don't know how you guys could have that conversation when you could just eat whatever you want and not die from eating even more.

-----
HStallion: Can he be the next billionaire that writes checks for Kavanaugh's vetting committee?
-----
Garlador: Will this be the guy that wants to run his own company?
-----
Sho_Nuff82: If there's one person you hate more than Bill Clinton, they're this guy, not Clinton Jr.

B-Dubs: All of these criminals need to be prosecuted to the fullest and then everyone who benefited from his nomination will pay the price!
-----
KtotheRoc: This is the next thing that makes me wish I wasn't in the Trump administration.

~!~Should I watch Goodnight Vikings?

JaeCryo: Update: I just watched the movie! There's no sound in it. I don't know if I should.
I just rewatched it a few months ago and my god is it is so good. I don't know what I'm about to watch. I don't know if I should watch it. I just watched the movie and am hooked on it. I am a fan of Paul Verhoeven and Jon Hamm.
What are the best/most rewatchable Vikings?
-----
Enduin: It's a GoT allegory movie.
-----
Masoyama: Yes, it is a really good movie.
-----
TheBeardedOne: You're probably fine. I think the original trailer was pretty good.
-----
JaeCryo: It's a sequel to Jaws.
-----
Squarehard: If I had to choose between it and Jaws, I'd probably watch it.
But in the case of Vikings, I'd probably just watch it.
-----
Stinkles: It's not bad but it really got under my skin.
-----
Kitsunebaby: I was just going to say this.
-----
JaeCryo: The movie is so good it's hard to believe it's from the same director.
-----
Squarehard: No way I'd say watch it.

Wulfric: Ryan Murphy's personal production company is at it again. With the upcoming release of The Office, Netflix has created a neat little framed set with a hunkle that connects to a projector.
This is also right now in release, if you're interested in a hunkle replica:
I've been thinking of doing all those scenes with the movie for the last few months. This whole business model is ripe to fail, there's no way in hell I would ever make a profit from it.
-----
Einchy: I'm pretty sure we got a thread about this.
-----
Wulfric: I'm not sure how long it will be before it's brought over from the early days of online production?
-----
Wolven Hammer: I'm not sure what happened on the boat. 
We'll be lucky if we get a trailer.
-----
AlteredBeast: I wish they would have put Ryan Murphy's Hulk in this.
-----
HStallion: That's a cool looking set.

Nerdyone: I saw an essay by an [Uncle] about [Uncle], in which he was making a character study about the relationship between his sister and his mother. He basically tied Habits and Events together in a very complicated way. It's a very interesting take on the relationship between the two characters. I think this was something I should watch. 
What are your thoughts ERA?
-----
CrazyIvan1978: I think you’re getting too carried away.
-----
Nerdyone: I thought the whole point of this show was to tell the story of the people they love while also trying to tell the two relationships.

~!~Anime lover, do you post your taste?

hordak: I love anime, but I think I really need to get more into it, I really like shonensui and hkv series and I love horror too. Also, probably not for the type of anime that I would consider to be "safe" or "adult". I guess I can't stand that sort of stuff, I actually really dislike the idea of shonensui
-----
Dice: I'm not interested in anime myself, but I like to watch a show or watch something with characters I like. 
One of my favorite genres is the mature manga trope, followed by a manga.
What are your interests?
-----
Siggy-P: I'm not into all that much anime these days. I love how the story is told, I'm reading it as a piece of artwork.
But I love to read. The art is inherently more exciting than the actual story, so I tend to go for that.
I've read a few things through the medium, but I would not recommend the Berserk manga. Format is kinda messy.
-----
Chivalry: Manga. It's great.
-----
Mesoian: Anime, but it's not a medium. I'm into anime.
-----
Menx64: I love reading, it's great.
-----
thekonamicode: Anime, but manga are still my favorite manga.
-----
HStallion: Anime is my FAX.
-----
Imperial Bishop: Anime, but I have no idea how it's even considered.
The art looks cool.
The manga is my FAX, but the one that I'd consider to be adult anime is manga.
-----
Dice: I've been watching Dragon Ball Super for the first time recently, and while the plot is really messy and the pacing is atrocious, the visuals are amazing.

~!~How many years will my debt be on Me?

Solid Sora: So, my credit card has been on the line for over 2 years now.
I was just notified today of the debt being serviced, and the cost of the debt itself.
I spent $14.5k on the two things I forgot. What's the right cost of both?
How long will it take for the debt to be paid off and my credit to be properly shitted?
Any advice?
I'm just surprised I'm only $1,865 in debt now.
-----
Shugga: I'm pretty certain after a few years of not paying anything in middle of employment (and having to pay it in cash) they'll just write me a check and I'd be out of the running.
-----
Luchashaq: Not too big a company to pay off but not too small a company to pay off.
I've had to pay off one of my credit cards in the past and I'm not too happy with it.
-----
John Rabbit: Mine was around 08 - 10.
It's been going on for about 4-5 years now.
-----
WhoTurgled: I don't care how long you've been unemployed, if you got a job in the meantime they'll probably give you a late payment, they'll just change it on the spot if you're late, and if they notice a pattern then they'll either pay it back or tell you to go away to get it fixed.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Yeah, I've paid for two things, a car and a house that might be paid off in 6 months.
-----
Solid Sora: It's been going on for about 4-5 years.
-----
thesoapster: I'm paying off my credit card in April and I'm not complaining.
-----
Dishwalla: I'm paying for my car in early April, so I'll have paid off my house in early December.
-----
johan: I've probably paid for my car last year, so I don't really really know how much is gone and what's going to get paid.
I don't know how much it would take for me to get paid but I could see it being enough to keep me going for a while.
I guess it's always interesting to look back on the past.

Tovarisc:

Thorn: I read this earlier. Only Trump could have said that.
-----
porkproduct: I know a lot of Trump voters are pissed and want to see him get impeached, so this isn't a real issue in the slightest.
-----
Shoeless: I think they're going to miss the point completely, but I have a feeling that, with the right person, it can be used to bring them into the WH.
-----
Jedi2016: He's probably right. He's angry and frustrated with Russian meddling.
-----
Cochese: We'll be seeing the results of this...
-----
Maxey: I don't think so. He's not saying it's because he's angry and he wants to bring in Russian dirt, but he's saying he's happy to keep the US in the international community and not because he's angry and frustrated with the Russian people.
-----
Jedi2016: That's the only thing I don't think Trump is angry about. He's angry at the US being involved with meddling in the international arena.
-----
Tovarisc: Yeah. This is not Trump. He's saying he's happy to have kept the US in the club.
-----
Bluebot: We've all seen how Obama used the meeting with Russian officials as an opportunity to use his presidency to put others before himself.

~!~So... how long before someone takes your job?

DongBeetle: It's a pretty big deal to me, I know, like what is going on?
I can't find a job that is equal to my current salary, but I've been applying for jobs. I've looked for a few more weeks and I don't have anything. The person I come in to is a sales rep who makes a few extra dollars an hour. I've been out of work a long time and have just shown up a couple times to speak with HR. They say that it's a short process, and that I really need a job quick to make my commute possible. What's the short answer to your question?
-----
maxxpower: Don't take it personally. Take it easy on the job.
-----
DongBeetle: To answer you I'm not sure, I feel like I'm walking out of a startup meeting by myself.
-----
tangeu: I have a price on the back end that I don't want to ruin in the future, but it's a killer to have a job that is so time-efficient that I'm not sure what I'll do. I'm doing all that while getting paid.
-----
DongBeetle: No I think I'm just going to take it easy on the job, but I also don't really want to invite HR to speak to me
-----
dietpepsi: Tell them you'll be fired in a month's time.
-----
Brock Reiher: "The longer you stay in your current job the longer you'll stay in the same job."
-----
JigglesBunny: As long as you don’t have any prior experience, it seems reasonable to assume the best choice will be the one you choose.
-----
Brock Reiher: Not sure why would HR want that quote though?
-----
DongBeetle: I think they're just afraid of pissing off HR

RoadHazard: Roger Stone? Meh, not a good man.
-----
gcubed: No, not a good person.
-----
ReginOfFire: No, he has no morals
-----
Kirblar: More of a description of Trump's chin than anything.
-----
GravisMors: I'm not going to say he has no morals, but I am not going to say he has any perspective.
-----
Kirblar: He has no real morals but as a self described good guy in the Trump camp it's a good thing.
-----
Xe4: Lmao, we're gonna get indicted on all these campaign violations.
I think it's time we stop electing right-wing criminals. Especially if the party is corrupt like this.

onadesertedisland: I'm not a big fan of any of them.

SageShinigami: I'm tired of this. It's all going to die.
I'm not saying they won't get their hooks in the right place, but I don't see how they can do a lot of these.
-----
LionPride: I mean I mean, it's a full series of comics

Punished Snaku: I’ll take what I can get at least.

UltimateTrainer: Is there a reason why you would want this to happen? Or just want some cheap comics to watch earlier in the show?

I wanted to talk to him about it but I'm afraid of what could happen next. I just had the day off and I was feeling depressed and I just want to sleep.

~!~Is this the most rewatchable movie ever?

Thewonandonly: So I’m in the mood for this movie. It’s not the most watchable movie ever, but it is the most rewatchable movie I have seen. I don’t even know what to say. This movie is amazing and I think it’s like a masterpiece of a better time than today’s more popular movies. I’m not even going to list all the movies in the movie. I just want everyone to enjoy it and discuss the plot.
The plot of the movie is the most interesting part. The most obvious thing is that it is a serial adaptation of a classic story. There is even a small hint of a lot of the “plot” missing in this one. This movie is a lot more “straight forward” than other modern movie chases are admit. The actors are good and the world is fascinating, it’s a lot more action packed and more than the usual action movie chases. But the movie is a good movie and it has a lot of action packed action packed action.
It’s a good movie. But it’s not my all time favourite movie. But I have to say that I think it is one of the most watchable movies I’ve seen at the moment. It’s not a movie everyone is going to watch and I think it’s more of a fun movie to be re-watched than anything else. The music and cinematography is great and the acting is great.
I used to think the plot was boring and boring and just a
-----
BDS: The movie is more watchable than The Matrix and The Dark Knight.
-----
Mona: I mean, it has it’s moments. The premise is not boring and the visuals are actually pretty enjoyable
but the story, the ensemble, the cast, the cinematography is a real slog to sit through
-----
Dale Copper: It holds its own but I don't think it's quite as watchable as Phantom Thread or The Dark Knight.
I literally saw a friend of mine die on a plane from a heroin trip. He had a fight with the cop because he was smoking weed. So it's not really watchable.

~!~why is the ERA web page so goddamn slow?

Dragonzdogma: I use it on Android so I can just jump right to the bottom of the page without having to reload the page.
I have Firefox, Opera, and am using Chrome.
-----
Sesha: I use it on Chrome, Firefox, and FF browsers
-----
The Albatross: It's happened over the years with every mobile OS, I guess. There certainly is a toggle to "Slow" on the top menu, though I believe there was a toggle on the Android main page as well, and it's not there.
I use it on Android and iOS a lot, so it's not a huge deal.
-----
Mortemis: Not a lot of speed issue. It has a couple of small improvements and optimization, but it's still not better than the old free version.

~!~I don't take long to warm up to the idea of being an asshole

jkm23: Okay, maybe 5 minutes, or less, in a while, I'll try to get your opinion of why it is that way and how it's related to your personality, desires, and behavior.
I just want to break down why this is necessary.
I'm currently doing a lot of traveling, and I'm not going to sit around a table for an hour-long conversation with a stranger for an hour about everything. I don't have anything pretty to talk about or anything, so I just want to make an effort to make a start/finish conversation online.
I've been doing this for years. I don't need to be married, or have kids, or have anything like that. I just want to get it out there and not get married.
Am I weird?
-----
The Albatross: I don't think you're weird.
Being a weird person is fine. Being a weird person is a different matter.
-----
Dishwalla: I don't think the idea of being weird is weird. Being an asshole to others is not weird. Being weird is just that.
-----
nsilvias: I think it's a real thing but its a bit of a stretch to say I'm weird. 
I'm not talking about being on the "wrong side of the line" but being a kind asshole is definitely something people do for fun.
-----
sir_crocodile: I don't think you are weird.
-----
CormoranStrike: One of my biggest problems is that I can't really talk or feel anything, so I put my headphones on and just avoid the kind of people / where people talk/feel.
-----
jkm23: I don't know, too much stuff to keep focused on. I'm not really that well liked.
I'm not weird.
-----
Bengraven: I am, I don’t get to talk to people.

Spaltazar: what have you written?

Rocketz: I don't think so.

====================
~!~Why no one really likes The Last Jedi?

Bronx-Man: I’ll give it a shot for this thread, I’ll admit.
There’s no love for the original Star Wars film trilogy and it’s certainly not the kind of “best” trilogy of all time, but I just can’t get why people are having such trouble with it.
I mean, it’s not even that it’s crap. It’s that so many of the characters just feel like effing fucking puppets, and it just...feels wrong.
I should clarify that I don’t think it’s the kind of thing that should be considered the “best” trilogy of Star Wars films, it’s that it’s not even that popular.
What I get from it is that the Star Wars fandom doesn’t seem to be that crazy. But I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a “best” Star Wars movie.
Is it love? Is it nostalgia? Is it the weirdest, most obsessive fandom out there?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Love it or hate it.
-----
TheXbox: "Best" movie? Uhhh. Not really.
-----
Finaj: There's nothing more frustrating than watching people ruin the flavor of a film for no reason.
-----
Cocolina: It's a Star Wars film, it's not the worst film in the universe. The worst film I've ever seen is Rian Johnson's Rian.
-----
marrec: It's a masterpiece.
It's not even a good film.
-----
Khanimus: I mean, yeah. But when he removed the main actor's mustache for no reason, it made for a very uncomfortable experience.
-----
Wololo: Its a good film
-----
Wag: It's the best.
-----
Blader: The best Star Wars film??

~!~Akira's soundtrack is pretty great

Buribon: I remember hearing this song was good and it sounds like it was from the original Samurai Champloo.
And then I listened to the soundtrack again and I thought it was from this old children's anime The Phantom Blood.
There are so many great Christmas tracks in there.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't think the soundtrack is the best but it's a great soundtrack in all right's.
I also think the track that is reminiscent of my last one that came out a few years ago.
-----
Buribon: It's not the greatest but it's good enough.
-----
Mesoian: They're pretty great. It's not like they're bad.
-----
The Almighty Tria: Well not necessarily, it's just a good theme.
-----
Lulu: Phantom blood by the way.
-----
Cort: I liked it quite a bit because it was a good remix of the score from The Lion King
-----
Buribon: The original soundtrack was a remix of a score from Samurai Champloo.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I think the first Saiki song is a remix of The Soft Bulletin by Radio Deacon Rust as well and it's on the single.
Edit: Oh yeah I know that the 3 National Covers of Fighting (NAFAP) is also on the track.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I think so. The Japanese version is just a cover of an American radio song.

~!~The opinions of a former (polite) Trump supporter who took up arms to protest the White House.

Terra Firma: I'm not going to link to his Facebook post here, but here's some of his typical comments:
“If our country isn’t built on the 20th amendment, we shouldn’t have a second one, because they will never stop trying to destroy it. We’re not going to build a second 20th amendment. We’re not going to build a third wall.”
“What happened to the second wall? It wasn’t a wall. It wasn’t a wall. It wasn’t a wall.”
“Why didn’t they build a wall? Because it wasn’t a wall. It wasn’t a wall. They tried to tear down a wall.”
“No, I don’t know how you get to this. It was a wall. It was a wall.”
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: Morat Gurgeh is an American, he's right.
-----
HStallion: The first one is really dumb and completely pointless. The second one is a canard. The fact that the US wasn't built on the 20th century's 20th century is a disgrace to America's standing in the world.
-----
Brock Reiher: You can't make this shit up
-----
Khanimus: I'm not sure the comments are even worth reading, glad you confronted him.
-----
SugarNoodles: I mean, it pretty much makes sense. It's a wall. If it's a wall, we're not profiting off it.
-----
House_Of_Lightning: Do we want a second?
-----
Terra Firma: Yeah, I'm not sure it's necessary.
The second is a wall I just don't want to see.
-----
PeskyToaster: So can we just build a wall?

ReAxion: no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

~!~What's the best/easiest way to watch Netflix offline?

Ryaaan14: I’m curious if there is a way to watch Netflix offline on a wired or wireless network.
I have Sling TV and it’s so easy to get the most out of a cable subscription.
-----
Ryaaan14: A whole bunch of random shit that I’ve not seen or heard about yet
-----
UltraMagnanimous: I've been advised to use a proxy to watch offline streams. And if you need an IP address that can be proxied to a wireless network, it's Google's blocking streams from sites that have proxy traffic.
-----
Dekim: I've not blocked streams I'm streaming, but I've blocked streams I'm streaming.
-----
Ryaaan14: I’m sure there’s a way to watch it offline without proxy
-----
TheAbsolution: One of my friends from high school told me to use Netflix on his PS4 because he always had to turn it off.
-----
Mendrox: I use a proxy to watch streams on my router. I never use Netflix or their streaming service.
-----
Ryaaan14: I’m not sure there’s a way to watch them on a wired or wireless network.
I have Sling TV and I’m sure there’s a way to watch them offline without proxy.

~!~When does the 'X' in Positive Love Actually?

Bran-dono: It's always the most overrated and overused of the three, and it seems like it was designed as a crutch for an occasional romantic relationship.
I'm a bit more curious about how Era feels about the relationship. What do you think it should look like? What do you think it shouldn't look like, what do you think it should be? And why do you think it should?
-----
Bran-dono: It's a crutch to an 'open' relationship. It's not the most well-written relationship extension or anything.
-----
GalacticToast: When it's someone's favorite thing to do, get it over with.
-----
DarkLordMalik: When they say X to someone you’ve never been on a date with.
Lay down a weak foundation and accept it.
-----
Hollywood Duo: When you have a bromance with a girl you’d dated before.
-----
Kasai: When you want to say that you're "on" and they want to know why. 
Can't say that it doesn't happen to some other people, but it sure as shit happens.
-----
Lashley: When they say X to someone you've never been on a date with.
Shit will make them go lmao
-----
Lurcharound: When I'm in a relationship and they're yknow, "do you want me Y'all?" 
The answer to my question is, "No. Not in this case".
-----
Philia: When they say X to someone and they want to know why (usually Y), then that's a crutch. I'm not sure on whether or not their relationship has a good core/weak foundation to pull off.
-----
RolandOfGilead: When I was very young I had a very strong relationship with my father. I have some strong memories of my father talking to me when I was in the bathroom. I'm not sure if that's what you're talking about though.

~!~How to make the best of a bad situation?

Doom_Bringer: By a long shot.
I think I know what you are thinking but I just don't know. I think I would like to make a topic about this but I don't know. 
So my father has been in a car accident, the car insurance is sub base for the car we have in. I have a bad feeling about this because it will mean my car coverage will decrease. I have friends who have had to pay more for car coverage. But no one is driving the car at all. 
I am thinking about starting a charity drive. I know that it could be a good idea to donate a little. But I don't know. Am I right? I read up on the car idea but don't know. 
I know that my father has been doing everything I want to do but I don't know what I should do. 
Anyone have any experience with this? 
What do you think makes a good situation? 
Why is it bad?
-----
Aurongel: You're probably right and could be making a good difference with just the bare minimum of a bit more research.
Though, there's also the matter of time before your making a decision on the car. If things go poorly, you'll have a lot more time before your next decision is made.
-----
Cocolina: Make it as bad as possible
-----
Doom_Bringer: oh ok the two of you are good friends. I think I would be doing good though I really don't know the best way to make it right
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I'm trying to get the best of both worlds. I'm doing what I can right now.
-----
Doom_Bringer: I'm not sure if donating for any charity is wise about reading what your father has posted so far. I know there will be people who will tune in, but it does make the situation worse. I'm just not sure I want to be quoted when I read that.
-----
LosDaddie: Make the right decision for family. 
If your car is in jeopardy, donate the money. It’ll save you hundreds of dollars.

-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Your professor is awesome!
-----
chaos_planes: Yeah, I'm thinking about trying that.
-----
Yoshichan: A lot of my Bachelor's are for engineering. I don’t know if that’s a bachelors, but I’ve never used any python for something I’m not really good at.
-----
Mediking: I'm not good at math but this is pretty cool. Thanks professor!
-----
chaos_planes: I did, but you are. I just wanted to say that this is awesome.
-----
Driggonny: Using python I would assume? I got myself a free python bonus on a recent red team I don't care for.
-----
chaos_planes: Yea, I did, but I did this myself.
-----

~!~It's official: The First Season of the French Dynasty is amazing.

Scullibundo: I've been watching it since it was a show as a part of a drama for the Toqe program, and just as I was rewatching it when I was younger, I remember one of the characters being pretty light and fluffy.
-----
Powdered Egg: I'll never forget the scene where the king was drunk and thought he himself was the King.
-----
scintillk: I watched the show years ago and I loved it, the show is just so good now. The drinking episode was some of the most hilarious and emotional scenes I've ever seen.
-----
Jasup: It's a good show, but it's definitely not a comedy. It's pretty funny, but not comedy enough.
-----
Scullibundo: I’m not sure how it would be considered comedy without the entire actual show being funny. It’s certainly no “Comedy-Religious”, just a “Religious Comedy” program. And its peak in terms of being on par with something like Game of Thrones.
-----

HStallion: I'm generally not a fan of the "Religious" type of comedy but I'm not exactly opposed to it so it gets my vote.
-----
Dipro: I really enjoyed it for what it was. It was a lot of fun with a lot of interesting characters and people doing their thing.

Bor Gullet: There's a 'Watch' option on YouTube, but I don't see it option for Plex. Any advice?
-----
Ryaaan14: You’re using the wrong site, not Star Wars related.
-----
BDS: The only way I know about is the TV guide.
-----
Dennis8K: I don't know if it is on TV guide or Plex.
-----
sphagnum: It's on both sites.
-----
Dr_Boris_Goltz: There are two different versions of the YouTube TV app. One is the "new" one and the other the "old" version. I use the old one because I can use my Roku (or Apple TV) at the same time and I don't mind paying a subscription fee for it.
-----
Drensch: Google Cast, Google music, YouTube premium.
-----
HeartlessNobody2134: The new one, it’s very similar to the old one.

Taki: Do you use one? Does it get you lots of replies?
I'm trying to find a new twitter handle, so I started with one. It's short, but maybe 9 characters long. So I thought I'd start it off with a single tweet. And I'll be doing it this way:
-----
Mediking: I don't...
-----
Jadow: I'm a bot, so I don't have one.
-----
Poppy: I mean, I get messages from people and they always reply with an account message and preferably a nice little cry about how they're being discriminated against and you're ruining their life and/or raising your child.
I don't tweet at all, but I do retweet like 5 - 7 things I've written or done that I hope will get a response, yay!
-----
Dennis8K: I used to be on one, now I'm on...
-----
The Albatross: I'm not a bot.
I have a bot feed I make up that I put up for everyone to see and share...
It's not a bot feed, OP, but a live feed I created for the purpose of satire (the humorous one, not fake).
-----
yuoke: I'm a bot too.
-----
nsilvias: I'm a bot, but Twitter is cool as hell.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i'm a bot
i don't tweet about anything, but i do write about games i've played, movies, anime, comics, tech
i don't use my real name, so no, im a bot
-----
Jadow: I'm a fake name, I'm unknown to the person on twitter, so maybe I'm just not a good enough source for a bot to have an account, and I'm allowed to say/share my name without it being either a fake name or my real name being mentioned I'm not a good enough person to have a bot on Twitter, it's not fair if you can't do the same for me, so I'm not going to post my real name.

KojiKnight: I am completely new to shopping, but I want to get ideas on how to get the most bang for your buck with online shopping, and how to do that. I don't want to pay for shipping, I want to be able to return any item if I don't like it, and the last two items I've returned, I think. I've looked at Amazon, Ebay, and PayPal, and none of them seem to do this. I'm just trying to figure out what to do, and I'm pretty clueless. Anyone have any experience with online shopping?
I just want ideas and to help others out.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: This is what I was thinking.
-----
Supercrap: I don't really care what the product you are looking for is and why you're looking for it, just don't expect it to be the best bang for your buck.
-----
BriGuy: The kind of online retail you do have to do is usually painless and cheap to have. The kind of stuff you actually want to get is too much work, to support a store that has a product feature, to have shipping options, etc. There's a lot of things that are easy to get off the shelf and hard to find stuff.
-----
Kuro: Sucks that you have to buy a lot of stuff in order to get any kind of bang for your buck.
-----
snacknuts: Just don't get all those websites dedicated to scamming people into saving their own money.
-----
One Eyed Willy: Sucks to be shopping online, but that's just what the majority of people do. Pay their return shipping, and that's it.
-----
Duxxy3: I don't know how anyone could possibly figure this out, but if you don't want to spend money, don't take it as a sign you're not doing your best.
-----
DJ_Lae: I had a bunch of stuff sent back to China because I didn't want to spend money on shipping (stuff from the US, not from China).
I did a full refund on what they sent me because I didn't want to pay for shipping.
-----
Stranger Things: I think you're still a bit naive, OP.
This is just the usual online/ Ebay bullshit:
====================
~!~The B-52s are the most badass plane in history

Squarehard: What the hell happened to the bombers?
I mean, the whole "what happened to the bombers" meme is kinda nonsense, but what is the point of these planes?
I'm not saying that they are necessarily the most badass thing in the world, or that they are a particularly terrible race, but they are the most badass thing in the world.
Even if you look at a bunch of their technology, at least you know they were wiped out within a few years, and even if you look at the actual history around them, it's pretty obvious that they're wiped out within the next few years.
-----
Heromanz: They were cool
-----
Apharmd: Or just look at the aeroplanes.
-----
TheBeardedOne: What did they do to their ship?
-----
Squarehard: The first plane that was actually hit, but the second plane was hit.
-----
KojiKnight: The first one was really cool. It was flying a giant ship that could just fly away and never land.
The second one was a joke, and it was funny.
-----
CesareNorrez: I'm going to guess the planes were already wiped out within a few years.
-----
Squarehard: That's...actually pretty badass.
-----
Apharmd: I'm not sure I understand the meme, but the other planes were thankfully able to glide away before they got to these new destinations.

WedgeX: He just turned around and said he’s a "really nice guy."
60 Minutes: "He was a really nice guy"
Bonus:
60 Minutes: "He was a really nice guy!"

60 Minutes: "He was a really nice guy"
-----
Brock Reiher: He's a nice guy, but he's not a nice guy by any means.
-----
Dishwalla: He was a nice guy, but he wasn't a nice guy because he was a really nice guy.
-----
Dennis8K: He was a nice guy.
-----
Powder: So then why was he a nice guy?
-----
JaeCryo: 60 Minutes: He wasn't a nice guy either.
-----

Clockwork: No one is nicer than the guy in the clip.
-----
WedgeX: He said he was a really nice guy. Well, he probably didn’t want to offend anyone.
-----
Blade Runner: He was a really nice guy. But he didn’t seem to enjoy being around other guys

~!~The Best Episode of The Simpsons

Sega Dreamcast: I’m talking about the episode “The Return to Springfield, The’s a Child”. This episode is pure excellence.
-----
makonero: That was hilarious.
-----
DGenerator: The 18th and the 19th were the peaks of the show. The Simpsons accomplishments are astounding.
-----
Travo: That was great.

HStallion: It was a great episode all around.

Rvaan: That was a great episode.

HStallion: That's a good one.

~!~For the People Behind the ‘Culture War’, Designers Are Boring

Saya: Link
-----
Sasliquid: I don’t see why they were doing this at all. I know a lot of companies did it and had the opposite reaction and I’m not surprised.
-----
Kyougar: That's because designers are looking for validation. They do not want to look like such garbage after they designed for them.
-----
CrazyAndy: That's a lot of people.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Capitalism.
-----
Walter White Walker: I like to think that my work did more than I used to.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I'm not from the US but the opposite for some reason.
-----
Kyougar: No one is really paying attention to the culture in the US.
-----
Booki: Like designers should be doing this.
-----
Sulik2: I guess it's cool when names get in the way.

~!~This is How Cohen Spent The Last Eight Years In Prison

Wondergal: Spent Eight Years In Prison, Direct Link:
-----
BlackGoku03: That doesn't surprise me at all. 
Pretty scary how that's going to work out.
-----
Stinkles: I can't imagine how long this will last, though.
-----
Khanimus: I can't imagine how long this will last.
-----
Einchy: I'm glad they actually felt guilty about doing this.
-----
BronsonLee: They were planning this out for the worst
-----
FreezePeach: This story is getting old now.
-----
Stoopkid: I remember the news being about the Women's March back then.
-----
Mahonay: I will never get sick of this.
-----
Powdered Egg: Good lord.

====================
~!~Hesitant to the tradition of the big screen, is there a reason for this?

ItWasMeantToBe19: I think that the modern big screen as a format has been around since the mid-90s. It was used mostly for special effects, but it was still used big time in film.
Before that, it was used mostly for movies with a big budget.
However, the format began in 1999 with the PS2/PS3 releases. It's been used so much that it's now used in more than 90 percent of all special effects films.
From the trailers, to the trailers for movies and commercials, to the trailers for TV shows, to the trailers for games, everything is soooooo nice.
Anyone else notice this?
-----
Cybersai: There was a big res 4-D boom in the late 80's.
-----
Mr. Tibbs: As someone who does the vast majority of CGI in a movie (that is, movie trailers), it's been there since the early 90s.
I think the big Warner Bros. movie that came out in 2003 was inspired in many ways by the big screen experience and was shot entirely on 4DX.
-----
thecouncil: I mean, it was a huge jump from early TV trailers to trailers for movies.
-----
KarmaCow: I think there was also a big 4DX boom in the early 2000s.
-----
Cabbagehead: no
-----
Ozzy Onya A2Z: That's an impressive hurdle.
-----
itwasTuesday: This thread is going to be a lot of fun.
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: Well, my friend doesn't get the 4DX CGI and the only time I saw the 4DX trailer was the early 90s.
-----
Boiled Goose: Ever had a movie with a big budget that they were so high quality they were insane?
-----

====================
~!~How do you deal with being friends with coworkers?

Coraline Jones: I’m in the same boat as you.
I guess I’m not, but I’m still trying to figure out how to be good friends with my other coworkers.
I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but I don’t really have a lot of friends in general. I lost my job a couple months back due to depression. I wanted a new job after I found a new job, but didn’t get the offer. I needed a buddy, and I got this one!
Fast forward to now, I’m in a unique situation. I work at a small store and I’m still dealing with my depression. I’m always being nice and supporting my coworkers, but one day I’m going to a game store and there are like 4 of us in a big section of the store. The one coworker that is there is always being nice and supporting, but he takes the brunt of the work.
I have no real hobbies or interests other than video games, so I can’t really relate to anyone.
Does anyone else deal with similar things, but in the private confines of work?
-----
Travo: No.
-----
FUME5: You don't like anyone in the office, you just don't like your coworkers.
-----
Cripplegate: You don't have any friends. I have a few but I don't really have a connection with any. My past was pretty unremarkable and I don't plan on ever getting another job. My current situation is nothing special and I've been working on a little project but I've been spending a lot of time online so I don't really see myself going anywhere.
-----
Dyle: I have a very negative work-life balance that comes and goes. I'm doing a really bad job and I'm leaving in May, I've had enough stress to make the separation less satisfying than the job itself, but I've still managed to maintain my positive mind-cleaning image and self-confidence, rather than keeping the job as positive as I can. I'm still learning how to read the book books I read, and I'm still learning how to make lists and organize my time. I'm also starting to feel more comfortable with myself in terms of being able
====================
~!~What are some general benefits you see that are dependent on your lifestyle?

entremet: I understand the sentiment that most people get screwed by the weather. I'm just talking about lifestyle. I'm personally a vegan. I don't want to see insects or other crazy creatures get dumber than the guy above me. I know that's pretty nuts, but I think it's a good general benefit. 
I'm curious if anyone has any other saturated fat tips that they are willing to look into. I'm thinking about just dropping some things on their foods, but I'm thinking about giving them more fiber, so I'd like to hear some stories about people having things like that.
-----
Jombie: I'm bi, so no.
-----
jcs: I’ve seen things that I’ve never had anything like that. I’m not interested in the answer.
-----
TaterTots: I don't think I'm a hypocrite about the need to look after my body.
-----
entremet: Yeah. I was talking to a friend and she said that vegan is one of the better options for protein and fiber. I've never heard of it, but I guess I'll look into it later.
-----
Terminus: I’ve seen plenty of people whose diet doesn’t include meat.
-----
Moppeh: I don't see any.
-----
Zoc: Self care. That's it.
-----
entremet: I don't eat too much sweets. Does that count?
I like sweets, but my body has a hard time digest them.
-----
SugarNoodles: Does anyone know if they’re doing it right or just by eating a lot of them?

Deadpool 2 Finds Its #1 Screenplay of 2018
-----
Hobbesian Thudercat: I'm so glad that I'm not the only one. 
Also, that's a solid score lol
-----
Psychoward: It's just Deadpool
-----
Fistfulofmetal: I'm a huge fan of the first film, but I don't think I'd rank it higher than it has a right to be.
-----
Big_Blue: It's not even the best reviewed film of the year.
-----
Aftermath: Its just the best reviewed film I've seen in years
-----
Shugga: Ugh. Wack.
-----
J_Viper: I mean it's great, I guess?
I don't know if it's the best movie I've seen in years, but it's the best thing I've seen all year.
-----
Psychoward: It's just the best reviewed film I've seen all year.
-----
Aftermath: Apparently this film did huge numbers in the second and third week of its release, gonna be tough to top the Box office this year.

====================
~!~Why is my job so hard to work/do everything manually?

Halo 2: I have been laid off at the start of the new year (had a lot of benefits) and this morning I had this urge to call in sick and try to get my hours off.
I'm at my desk and find it impossible to sleep. I'm just trying to do everything in manual unless I have to do it on a computer or phone or I have to be actively running a project while working.
It's a pain.
-----
Halo 2: The only thing I struggle with is my laziness. I am terrible at my job.
-----
Transistor: Talking to someone when I'm typing a reply or doing something I don't really want to do, and typing a reply won't do it for me
-----
Teh Hamburglar: That sounds like your feeling tired.
-----
Darth Vapor: All of this is basically what my last job did to me. Took me forever to get my masters degree. It was an absolute chore.
-----
super-famicom: I struggle with doing things when I'm at my desk.
-----
DJ_Lae: I struggle with input/output when it comes to working out, although I prefer the latter.
I don't really have a problem trying to input my own thoughts into my phone, since I don't even have a computer.
-----
Airegin: I'm not really a person for writing my own thoughts.
-----
PlayALLTheGames: OP, if you're going to get laid off at 17, there's a really good chance you can get laid off at any time.
-----
Halo 2: If I didn’t get laid off I’d probably be a lot more inclined to work somewhere else. At least that’s my little life.

-----
Arttemis: I can't wait til the morning of Trump's November victory.
-----

hydrophilic attack: shit sucks
-----
Netherscourge: Maybe a lot of people in the media are going to run with this news?
-----
Jersey_Tom: I'm confused, since Melania is wearing a MAGA hat, does that mean she is literally a nazi?
-----
Hollywood Duo: It's beautiful
-----
Cochese: Not like the press has been receptive to this.
-----
GK86: No you are literally a nazi.
-----
MeaningOfKarma: More like the Trump administration is literally turning over a new leaf with its Nazi policies

====================
~!~Is it bad that I have to take a shit when I am home?

NTGYK: I work in a local office for the last few years, so I'm a bit of a casual listener and I usually get a few buzzwords off, but nothing substantive. After a bit of a "what about spending money?" I'm not too sure what to do with those thoughts, as I don't think I'm going to feel all the same things as I used to.
-----
Alucrid: if you have no money and don't depend on it, it's not that bad
-----
Teh Hamburglar: Take a drop.
-----
xxracerxx: Take a shit?
-----
Kasai: I mean, if you don't have money and don't depend on it, it is not that bad. 
But if you have money and don't depend on it, it's not that bad.
-----
Volimar: That's not too bad. Most people I know don't have problems with their money and don't feel the need to stress about it.
-----
TheAbsolution: Yep.
-----
Airegin: I don't take a shit when I'm home and I'm not posting on gaming side.

Cocolina: It's fine if you need to have money, if it's designated for something.

Fat4all: no take a shit when i'm home

I think I'm going to watch it in 4th grade.

~!~Watching Batman vs Superman: The Animated Series

The perfect Dark: This made me think about how good of a watch this would be for the series as a whole. Would this be such a good series?
-----
Bor Gullet: I love this series.
-----
TheJackdog: it's like a TV show with better pacing and more...comedic in my ears
-----
TheBaldwin: I watched the live action version years ago, and still don't know how to feel about it.
It really didn't feel like a TV series at all, and was instead something I watched for laughs tho.
I really wish I could see a live action version of it, it could be a lot of fun, but alas, I don't know where to even buy the Blu-ray releases.
-----
The_Endgame: I feel like this is going to be just as good as the animated movie.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I just watched the first two movies and I enjoyed them quite a bit.

-----
BDS: Better than Breaking Bad

Dragonzdogma: Better than The Sopranos.

-----
Hours Left: Trump’s base lives on the border.
-----
Coyote Starrk: This is why its so interesting to see Trump supporters on this issue.
-----
Shadybiz: I'm sure he does not care about the illegals crossing over, so he or the rest of his base will just be happy with a low cost of doing business.

HStallion: The final numbers update show that the NRA is still winning.
Still further my SC is I sure hope they keep this up.

-----

BennyWhatever: I don't know what you're talking about, OP.
But yeah, try and pick a few cities in your area.
-----

TheBeardedOne: I know there's not a lot of cities that are easy to get to. I'm just looking for cities I've never been to, like San Francisco. You're looking for cities that are just too far for me, though.
-----
turbobrick: Osaka. I like that city a lot but I'm not sure if it is worth it.

~!~What are the best late-night TV host names?

CranberryChocolate: I am a huge fan of Seth Meyers. You may know him as the Seth Myers Show host. In 2003 Seth Meyers died in a car wreck after delivering his monologue to a live audience. While he was on air he left crack and punctured himself.
I'm sure others are former David Chang hosts. Seth also won an Emmy for Qipao.

~!~The last time a Dark Lord appeared in the Marvel Comics was back in the 70s.

SparksterMeta0: This is a bit old but here's a bit of information about what we know:
- The Dark Lord had just turned 2 in FF. He was defeated in the Avengers vs. X-Men #39. It was the most hyped movie of the year. 
- The movie had a rather tense final battle with Thanos vs. Hulk. It was the most hyped film of the year.
- The movie's biggest hit, for whatever reason, was Thanos vs. Hulk. 
- The biggest event of the movie was Hulk vs. The Human Torch. It was one of Marvel's best selling issues for a while.
- The movie's biggest hit, however, was Strange vs. Vulture. It was one of the most hyped issues in a while.
- "The Dark Lord Hulk is back!"
- It was one of Marvel's most hyped films.
The good news is that the next phase will be following the comics and releasing the movies.

BronsonLee: OH MY GOD
The next phase is happening?

====================
~!~Why does the US have so much hair on the left?

DosaDaRaja: It seems to me that everything about our facial appearance is more or less due to our genetic advantages in appearance, rather than the general economic and social climate we're currently facing.
I grew my hair in a style, as a middle-aged man, my mother had a fairly long head and a fairly narrow smile, despite being a child.
Now, I have a very narrow smile, as an old man, and a long smile as a child.
I also have a very narrow smile as a child, due to the fact that I have a very narrow smile.
So, I have to wonder, in the future, how much of our society, our culture and our general appearance is likely to be affected, over the next few decades, by climate change.
-----
DosaDaRaja: I'm not sure, but I find that the general facial appearance has been ruined by various factors, mostly environmental/food/socialization.
-----
sleepnaught: Because we love our food and our food sucks ;(
-----
L Thammy: I guess that in some ways, yes.
-----
DosaDaRaja: I feel like our appearance is dictated by our genes, and in some ways, it's cultural.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: Because of the 1st world and the environment, and on the other hand, we love and support what is nature's way
-----
shnurgleton: Because we love the natural beauty and all the conflict and strife that surrounds us
-----
BAD: Because we love all the bad shit
-----
DosaDaRaja: I don't know if I'd call myself an ally if I were to grow up with a British Menge following the current global warming trend.

~!~Songs that will change your perception of the world

signal: Allright: this thread is meant to be a wake up call for us to act in ways that inevitably make us feel isolated and unwelcome in our own world. You may be like me but you're not so sure. Let's discuss some great songs that will make you feel like a real, part of the United States of America.
-----
Truant: I'll always have a place for my own music on the album cover.
-----
sphagnum: This one from Rush Hour:
-----

signal: Not sure what's going on here.
-----
Yerba_Sutra: "Feel" by Teen Dream
The title is a bit weird but I don't think it's a bad thing
-----

Stencil: "She's not even looking for me" by James Blake
The title is a bit confusing but yeah it's a great song and I think this is an okay song title.
-----

signal: I think there's a fan community for Rush Hour’s soundtrack. I'm talking about songs that have been featured in other Rush songs but they appear in the same soundtrack.
-----

====================
~!~It's the Fall of Nicolas Cage and Michael Gambon

Kuro: The Wrap is back with their Fall/Winter TV recaps. They did a great job recapping Cage's fall, and it's interesting to see some notable mid-season changes. A lot of the changes seem like they've removed some of the more pointed roles that we had previously covered, like Adriano Bruno, but I'm still excited for what they'll be rewatching.
Cage is a real legend and the UFC legend. This is the dude who most famously pulled the "stupid" actor from Hong Kong and smuggled him back. A lot of YouTubers are talking about Cage being a huge star, but I think this is the first time they actually have a real talk with him about his career, and it's awesome to see him go back and speak more truthfully.
I can forgive them for calling it quits when he's gone, but it's nice to see him coming back and speak openly on things. I'm hoping this will be the case for him.
-----
Kuro: The Wrap contacted Cage about the recap a few months back about it and got the official video for season 2. I'd love to watch more of his career. I'm sure they'll be able to get a big star back from him.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I am not really sure what the point of this recap is. I don't really mind a movie about him because that's just me talking.
-----
Kuro: I'm curious if you guys have watched the whole thing and can elaborate on the whole thing. They're not going to back down from watching it. I want to see a good performance.
-----
Kuro: I just want to have a good movie. At least a movie about him.
-----
Agar25: I love this dumb fuck. It’s like the end of the end of the X-men movie trilogy that’ve just been built up and finally became good
-----
Taco_Human: I was hoping for a movie about his career. I've been super down with the X-Men movies since they first released.
-----
EdibleKnife: I think it's time for the X-Men to die. That's my man.
-----
Kuro: Alright I was gonna bump this. I just saw the whole

~!~The Shins have announced new album 'The Secret Life of Pets' (Slayven)

Slayven: 
-----
Htown: That seems like a really weird cover band.
-----
Mavis: That seems like a really weird cover band.
-----
Directed by Fulci: The opening band from the Shins is pretty decent, but the Shins' 'Secret Life of Pets' is not exactly a great cover band.
-----
just_myles: Idk. I don't know about this one. I like the short cover version of the song.
-----
Htown: I like it too, but I'm a little disappointed that it's a cover. I don't know where the song is supposed to come from.
-----
Htown: I think it's a cover.
-----
Htown: like the song, but it doesn't really have much to do with the actual song.
Like the song is pretty good, but I don't know if it's the right source for some reason
-----
poptire: The cover is pretty poor.
-----
Htown: I don't know. I think the song is slightly better.

~!~What are your favorite MCU movies?

BDS: I'm looking for cool movies that are only 3-5 films into the year. Remember the Dark Phenom (2011) and Avengers Infinity War (2014)? Or the Mockingjay: Betrayal (2017)?
I'm more interested in ones that have multiple movies. The first Iron Man was pretty good, and I think it's probably the best MCU movie, but it's not Marvel movies.
I want to see some that are different.
-----
Dio: you know, for real.
-----
More_Badass: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Scarlet Witch, and the rest of the recently announced movies
-----
Drewton: There’s a bit of Star Wars you can ignore but that’s about it, yeah
-----
TheLostBigBoss: Infinity War, in particular, and the recent Iron Man 2.
-----
kswiston: Harry Potter and the Last Jedi are on that list. I also have fond memories of The Avengers as a kid.
-----
Forkball: I love TLJ, I actually cried when I saw it.
-----
CrazyDude: I think it's pretty accurate.
-----
shnurgleton: I think the 7 of The Avengers

El Bombastico: *Insert random superhero movie here*
"Hahaha, no, those are not superhero movies." - Those

~!~New research finds that single-payer national healthcare system in US is better than Medicare and Medicaid in Canada

BAD: 
-----
Krejlooc: OP, if I were Canadian I'd call the US a "shithole" when it comes to healthcare. It's a shit-ton of things I'm actually sick about, but I'd be much better off getting an in-home and out-home visit when I was paying for it.
-----
Luchashaq: I live in Canada and have never seen a single expense go beyond $20-30k.
I spent $50 on my phone bill in the last year.
I would get all my stuff done in one go and save like $30 that way.
I spend the money every month.
I am basically paying $100 a month for a decent insurance.
-----
Noroi_Kisaragi: how much is that then?
-----
BAD: $100
-----
Krejlooc: My family has a home with no doctors or dentists. We're a good 20 to 30k each.
That's instead of $200 per family member for health insurance, but about $500 per family and they don't even have doctors.
-----
Rory: $80 ERA for a health insurance package.
$250 for my car and my house.
$50 for a car rental.
$200 per month for specialists services.
-----
Krejlooc: I mean, I'm not a doctor, so yeah, I'm not quite in the same situation, but we're both in the same $120K bracket.
So yeah, see, that's a pretty good deal.
-----
BAD: $50:

~!~Passed the Torch

Robotnik: Pretty cool that he's walking past the bar in the background. The bar is filled with beer cans still.
-----
TearablePuns: I'm so down for this. Love the movie too.
-----
Geist: Man, if the movie was a different time or location, I'm sure he'd have died had he not been in the mood to tackle the bar with the sights.
-----
Lashley: I have been wanting to see this since the beginning.
I was so excited, then went in my seat and was so wrong for a second, I had to look away.
Afaik, I don't know how much I watched.
-----
BDS: I'm so sorry to hear that.
-----
GMM: I am so sorry to hear this OP.
-----
Transistor: I'm so sorry to hear about this. 
I love the movie so much, but I can't have it in the same genre as the Torch - it's so different in its tone and plot from the movies.
-----
Landford: Fuck yes, pass. Gave up after the first lap.
-----
Robotnik: I never thought I would say this but I love the movie.
-----
Khanimus: I don't know if I would say this, but I can't have it in the same genre as the Torch.

~!~Marvel Comics' endgame: X-men Noir #1

ZattMurdock: This is the best X-Men story I've read all year. I've been thinking about picking up the series since it dropped a month ago, but I'm also absolutely pumped for it to end on a high note.
I've only ever read two comics so I'll always have to go through both X-Men books, but Noir is probably the best X-Men story overall. It's a story about mutant-filled high schools filled with awkward professors and the awkward irrevocability of it all.
-----
Schlorgan: That was easily the best of the X-Men books, but I feel like it doesn't have the punchiest or funniest humor in any sense of the word.
-----
Pilgrimzero: I’m not sure if it’s the best but it’s Noir. I like Magneto but I prefer the X-Men timeline.
-----
mrtl: I agree, it's Noir but I don't think the X-Men stuff is really dark humor.
-----
ZattMurdock: X-Men Noir is pretty dark humor. Magneto for me. But I guess I am also a little too sensitive to that shade.
-----
rrc1594: I love X-Men Noir but this is for sure the darkest and most fucked up X-Men story.
-----
ZattMurdock: If you're reading this, you're either a little too sensitive to Magneto's treatment of Professor X or you're just sensitive to the whole "X-Men" thing that I was never too sensitive to. Wolverine and Wolverine have a lot in common.
-----
zethren: I really enjoyed X-Men Noir. I wanted it to end on a very high note.
But it just didn't work, and it ends on a very low standard.
-----
ZattMurdock: You're right. X-Men Noir is much darker, much edgier, much more 'ol comic. But X-Men Noir is just too edgy for me. I liked Magneto but hated the whole "evil thing" angle.
The final showdown with Wolverine in X-Men #38 was very dark and brutal.
That said, you're right.

~!~So, how much of your savings should we be expecting to see from the market?

shaneo632: I'm pretty fed up with the US's general mess of an economy and the UK's direction on trying to deal with it.
I've been investing my savings into a minimal return fund, but I'm also concerned with what other people think of us when they come over.
Anyone else worried about this?
Edit: actually I think it's only a tiny bit more than £8 per week, I'm not so worried about it being a giant load of cash.

The Bookerman: Don't you worry. There's some 401k and Roth IRA options available if you just save a little.

~!~Presidencies and Elections in One New Orleans

NoName999: Title is a bit tongue in cheek, but it's a nice little history about the two upcoming elections in the city.
I don't think this is it, but it's a pretty interesting thing to watch.
I live in New Orleans now.
I'm a very liberal person, but this is really interesting.
Edit: since people seem to be confused about the meaning of this, just think it's about the elections.
-----
adj_noun: Oh, and about how much money they're spending on their Chauncey.
-----
NoName999: I don't think that's a big deal, isn't it?
-----
Classicrock78: Yeah I know a lot of people here have never been to New Orleans.
-----
Boxxy: That is pretty interesting to see.
-----
GK86: That's the problem with voting: the people can be wrong and cheating too often.
-----
Joe: Their coverage literally covers all of the election, and there's not enough time for error and stuff to really come through.
-----
Steeped in a Sea of Games: I'm guessing it's not going to be a popular vote now that it's happened.
-----
NoName999: Are there maps showing where the votes are?

~!~Why didn't Rian Johnson turn down The Phantom Menace's script?

NTGYK: I don't want to be rude, but I wanted to make this thread because I was talking to a co-worker about The Phantom Menace and she said that Theodosians were the least interesting and Johnson was the least interested in the movie. I don't know what changed that, I didn't care about it and I didn't care about the movie. I just wanted to get it over with.
But why didn't he turn it down because he was busy with other things? He had a two hour long vacation scheduled to do was he, she was busy with other business and it was going to be a long weekend. So why not just turn it down and just write it off as a fluff of a film? I mean, he's the guy that's supposed to be the protagonist of the film, so he's got a lot of screen time to do it, plus I don't care if he's busy or not, he'll do it. 
I thought about this a lot lately because I've been thinking about this movie since it came out and I returned to the theater after I wasn't sure I wanted to see it. I didn't really want to be bothered about it being a fluff of a movie and I don't want to ruin it for myself. I just wanted to get it over with, I thought it would be good to not worry about it again.
-----
Cocolina: It was a bad film
-----
Yerffej: I prefer just not bother with it.
-----
Smurf: I mean, if they're busy they might want to see it. I find it tires having to deal with it, but if it is just poorly put together, I don't really mind it.
-----
Brakke: I'd prefer it to be stopped and written down somewhere I wasn't expecting.
-----
Khanimus: Because if they're busy and just want to see it, then it's just going to be a bad film.
I don't understand why they're interested in it on its own.
-----
Mona: I thought it was a good movie, but it's not a great movie
No, I don't think so
-----
Slappy White: It is definitely a good movie. I thought the movie was great, but

Sagroth: I would expect something like $500k-800k per pay-out to make a meaningful difference in this country.
-----
Dekim: It's all in lies.
-----

KSweeley: I'm not sure what is going on with the $100,000 budget analysis, I think it is a "fiscal disaster" in that it shows the entire government is utter bullshit.
-----

KSweeley: I don't know the law, but maybe it is a tax.

Kirblar: The largest party in the Senate is running the country with basically no spine.

Hollywood Duo: Living in Germany it's hard to tell who is Trump supporting outside of the US but what do you think of the Trump cult in the US and outside this country?
-----
Menelaus: About a week ago, the president of the United States was interviewed on Fox and Friends. Today he's back on the program and it's just as reprehensible.
He puts them in the same camp as Cameron.

PersonAndStuff: I don't think Trump supports them. He's a crazy human.

Dishwalla: mostly left leaning, right leaning, and pro-abortion.

Ziltoidia 9: Trump supports them and that's it.

Jarmel: I don't know. That question is dumb.

Deleted member 1258: I've never experienced anything like this before, but tonight I woke up and nearly passed out. I thought I'd pass out for a few hours until I passed out. I didn't have any panic attacks afterwards. I woke up to find out I had spent hours vomiting and just fighting back tears all night. I ended up throwing up and couldn't sleep.
I was so scared for the rest of it that I didn't take to the bathroom. I had to wake up and walk around one night to fight off the bad vomit.

-----
Alcotholic: What is happening to you?
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: I'm sorry for your loss.

SugarNoodles: It sounds like you're doing a lot of fighting. You have a lot of muscles, it's tough to shift them with your body. Just like how a small amount of weight can shift your body weight. 
You've been fighting and fighting, but after a while you just got accustomed to the weight loss it seems like you've become more self-aware.

Teh Hamburglar: You should be fighting your way out.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I've been fighting myself for years now

~!~What are you doing for lunch?

entremet: I usually do 2-3 lunches a week, depending on how busy I am. Lunch is mostly for the food, but I usually do some video games, video games good movies, and movies good for sleep.
I'm pretty into savory/pretending dishes. But I'm not a huge food snob. I like eating raw chicken, salted peanuts, raw fish, and probably also burgers. Though I've been eating a lot of veggies lately. But I enjoy eating raw turkey.
I'm a big fan of Mediterranean dishes, too. I've always liked lab-grown A.G. and I'm always super psyched about bell peppers. I'm a huge fan of raw veggies, too.
So I'm curious if anyone here has ever had a really wild experience eating lab grown foods, and how they're doing. Also, I'm curious if there are people here who have done it and found a way to get away with it. I'm probably over 100yrs away from becoming a meatless, vegan person.
-----
Robinson: Eating lab-grown food is not wild.
-----
ZackieChan: Eating lab grown food is wild.
-----
Forerunner: I've never eaten lab-grown food. Eating food grown from wild animals is not wild.

Sawneeks: Eating lab-grown food is pretty wild, and I've never eaten a raw tomato. I've eaten lab-grown yogurt. No shame in having done it though.

Subpar Scrub: Eating raw, whole sun-dried tomato, clove of garlic, olive oil, chives, nuts, dried cranberries, dried cabbages, dried ejimoutas, peanuts, dried dates, cranberries, dried celery, peanuts, dried chilli, dried chili (it's not chili), dried celery, canned jalsimmon, salt, pepper

I know some people use the cable that comes with the cable and I'm wondering what's the best way to use it. I have no interest in spending money for a cable that will only accept one USB-C connection, but I'm not sure what I should do.
I'm not 100% sure what I just described or what's the best way to transfer files directly from my laptop to the USB port, but I would like to have a portable form factor.

DeliciousSunnyD!: He's saying that Russia and China are testing nuclear powered weapons, and saying that they should shoulder some of the blame. They know they can't win the Cold War, and will just test them for launches. This would obviously piss off China and Russia, and would likely draw the SK/Russia "red line" to threaten them in such a way that they wouldn't be punished for their nuclear capabilities.

~!~PSA: A look at how the last 3 seasons of the Wire are doing

jack_package_200: I am so fucking sick of this shitty show. 
I can't believe it's been 3 years since watching this show. I remember being hyped as fuck for Thor: Ragnarok and how it would be awesome to see it done again.
I also really liked the fact that the gang were actually the real villains in the story. One of the main characters was the gay slur that was being used in the run-up to the Olympics. One of the main characters was a man who had sex with a prostitute in a bar and also had a secret identity for the older guys in the gang. In the end the real villain is a conspiracy theorist who is getting dusted up.
I remember the last 3 seasons of the wire were a lot more interesting than the seasons 1 and 2.
But now that I've watched the last 3 seasons and have watched the show back to back it feels like I'm missing out. 
I've seen 6 of the older guys in the gang mentioned in the season's title and 2 are outright fictional characters.
And those 6 guys are just the bad guys that can't get along or are too stupid to realize that the older guys are real. 
I mean I know they are being recorded but are they actually real? Are they all just just just just in character? 
Also I have never seen the old guy mentioned in the run up to Thor: Ragnarok. 
Does anyone else think this is a common knowledge? 
I'm also going to watch the Thor 2: The Dark World airing on Netflix this weekend.

~!~How often do you visit your local library?

ASleepingMonkey: Era, I've been fortunate to not encounter a ton of library staff that I've never lost. However, my local library recently started having a large selection of children's books that are meant for grown-up children and I'm a huge fan of books like Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot or Stephen King's The Brothers Solomon. I like the idea of getting books for younger children by visiting them (though I know they aren't meant to be read by old children).
How often do you visit your local library? How old are you? Any special occours you wish you had?
-----
Chivalry: All the time.
-----
One Eyed Willy: Never. The only thing I should be worried about is if someone snoop picks my library card and loads it onto a bus.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've got a few books from there occasionally. They are costly and I don't like to lug around my physical books around.
If I were a rich person, I'd be a lot more careful about what I put in my library card. I used to have a pretty comprehensive library account when I was younger, and would keep a pretty detailed list of all my favourite authors and authors I'd checked off my list. But I don't really keep much personal stuff around, mainly because I don't have the time to store it all and I just don't like to leave my stuff out when I'm at home.
-----
CormoranStrike: Rarely. I got a book from there a few years ago, but I don't read much at all and I don't really like the way the library displays it.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: It's been a while for a while but I remember having a book from there a few years ago that was pretty cool.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I've read a bit of a lot about my experience, especially on the people who live there. It's a pretty alien place, and I don't know how much of a violation of their rights they have to read anything there. I've also heard some really vile things regarding the young children who are visitors, including people saying that it's an eyes-in-the-tube hellscape and that visitors shouldn't be allowed to come and see it.

~!~Will the rise of the far right be a huge deal in the next decade?

IceDoesntHelp: I'm a bit concerned about the rise of the far right. There was a Pew Research poll a month ago that said that if we go through the same cycles it's going to be quite different. They say we are in a divided world where "it's hard to be in the center" (ALT right) is no longer the leader, "the right is strong as nails" (ALT anti left) is no longer the leader, "the left is weak as nails" (ALT anti right) is now the leader.
I'm not saying that they don't have a leader, I'm worried about the rising of the far right as a result of Trump. I don't know how much of a deal we are in.
-----
ZackieChan: Depends on how this ends. I don't think the far right will become divided as much as they already do, but it'll definitely have an impact.
-----
Tomohawk: They will all die.
-----
super-famicom: Trump will never be the leader of the US.
-----
Cochese: They can and they are idiots.
-----
HockeyBird: The far right will be extinct.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: It will be closer to 10 years or so until people realize that the GOP has killed the careers of thousands of men and women for decades and so we can no longer vote for candidates who support bigotry.
-----
Chopchop: I don't think so. It's only natural that a lot of people would disagree.
-----
Shugga: Nah not unless you're talking about the alt-right.
We're going to see the rise of a new Neo Nazi Neo Neo Neo Neo Party.
-----
IceDoesntHelp: It's definitely definitely happening but I'm also not worried about it. Especially as Trump is getting normalized.

~!~New Sonic Movie on the Left

Cream: This is the best way I've seen the debate on the best way to "unleash the great innovation" of Super Sonic.
-----
Daytak: I'm pretty sure that's the only debate anymore
-----
Sneaky Gato: This is good, but it's a lot of nothing.
-----
Khanimus: Gonna take a long time to get to the "just make a new Sonic movie" argument but my kids are going to love this one.
-----
MochaKoffee: It feels like it'd be a knock-on of the original Series by a director who wanted to focus more on the lore.
-----
Cream: I can imagine people posting really funny stuff about the new Sonic movie in the comments, all of it with a DICE-like "Sonic Cinematic Universe" and a bunch of self-proclaimed experts in anime are going to be there.
-----
gdt: Do it. It's good but it's not super great.
-----
Cream: I'm not sure why people would put FSN in this discussion. It's a mess.
-----
Dekuman: Is this a step up?
-----
Cream: I'm not sure how you could argue that a franchise with a TV-friendly plot and a movie with a C&D universe is better. The idea is to get something from the source material that is actually entertaining.

~!~As a student, I’ve been bullied. Where do I fix it?

ToddBonzalez: So I was working during the week and had a class where I talked about school shootings. I was eventually given a pushback from a teacher who noted that I was getting hit in the mouth with my armchair and that I looked like a kid.
I continued to talk to the class and talked to the classes teacher. I was told that I was too quiet at times. I didn’t want to cause any public disquiet. I was given a bunch of warnings and I walked out of the class.
I’m a very quiet person, I’m still learning about guns yet I’m being bullied by a bunch of people. I have no patience for bullies. I’m scared of them and I don’t know what to do at this point.
I know what I want to do is have a conversation with a teacher in a moment of weakness. I know I need to talk to a real help, but I’m scared of potentially being harrassed by a real person. I’m scared of leaving a mark somewhere, but I’m scared of dying.
Where do I even start to heal? I feel like I’ve been victimized enough times that I don’t want to leave a mark on anyone else’s future face.
I can’t even begin to remove myself from the situation if I’m being bullied. I don’t wanna be the one who doesn’t want this behavior to be an option.
I’m scared of getting hurt, and I’m scared of hurting people. I have no idea how to go about it but I’m afraid to leave a mark or lose some friends I lost myself with.
The school I went to was really good, but I don’t know what I’m going to do when I go to the burnout.
I just wanted to make this thread for those who are dealing with this. I have a ton of questions though. Any advice is appreciated. I think it would be best if I just left this thread here permanently. I do not have a school.

~!~The best time to buy clothes online?

AmericanKirby: I'm going to be moving in a few weeks so I'm going to Uni(where I’m going to live) with a roommate. I've purchased some decent (non-heavy) teal and fleece (so I can hide the stripes inside). I'm thinking of trying to dress up as something that would hide the pants behind the shirt.
What I'm looking for:
-Comfortable, ripped button up shirt with under-shirts
-pants and under-sleeves and box socks
-light socks with some under-pants
What would be a great option for me:
-pants
-pants with under-sleeves
What do I need to do:
-Put the shirt aside and tie the under-sleeves together
-Put the shirt aside (not the pants) and put the under-sleeves together
What about fleece, though? What do you think should be the go-to for me?
-----
Heromanz: Finish off your outfit with the most expensive gift you can give it (suit, underwear or t-shirts)
-----
Mulciber: I'm not trying to impress anyone. I'm just trying to get out of my rut. I'm not looking for any sort of attention. I'm just looking for attention.
-----
Rory: 
-----
AmericanKirby: Put it on the list and see how much you like it. Maybe post it in the community thread?
-----
CarpeDeezNutz: You do you.
-----
AmericanKirby: Her list is at the start.
-----
fluffydelusions: The above suggested pants, but I’ve already shopped around a few pairs of pants.
-----
AmericanKirby: How can you just change the color of the pants after you?
-----
Murfield: Just go to a local tailor and buy a few basic colors. They will be cheaper and easier to find.
You can also try some local deli and bread/biscuit stores.

Dalek: No fucking shit this shit is vile.

DrROBschiz: This is the most pathetic shit

lazybones18: Fucking disgusting

Mona: get the fuck out of here
-----
Ziltoidia 9: I've heard stories about the donuts from the news.
-----
marrec: That's really gross. 
I love chocolate, I don't need this shit in my life.
-----
AlteredBeast: That is some bullshit.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Why do they have to have a picture of the donuts with the word "Ruby" written on it?

Raguel: This is literal bullshit.

excelsiorlef: I mean they can use any colour of chocolate.

~!~In an interview with the Atlantic, Donald Trump embraced Russia

RustyNails: Donald Trump embraced Russia
This is the worst thing I've seen on the air in a long time. I'm sure no one here listened to the Atlantic interview.
-----
BDS: Why do I think he's so emotionally stunted?
-----
Pop-O-Matic: Not surprised, but also not surprising.
-----
WillyFive: He lies.
-----

Pop-O-Matic: "So I'm a little scary, but not surprising."
-----

BDS: Trump is probably lying about his relationship with Putin. It's the same as him saying something like "I don't know if I'm manipulating Putin."
-----
Guts Of Mind: More like he's emotionally stunted.
-----
rude: So he’s a little scary huh

====================
~!~Do you think the answer is "A" in a representative?

Squarehard: Do you think it's "A" in representative, or "B" in representative?
Just curious, in the case of a few cases, I think "No" based on the evidence presented, but I am curious about the answer to the question as well, as it is phrased in a way that is more logical than "A" in representative.
If so, how would you answer it?
-----
The Sum of Zero Steel: I don't have any knowledge of this question, but I can't imagine I've ever heard of this in any US representative.
-----
Fulminator: no...I don't think so
-----
The Albatross: No I don't think so, but I do think it's a problem.
I don't think a representative is necessarily always correct, but if they are, they should be able to correct the answer.
-----
Dishwalla: no, I don't think so for me. It's my kind of question.
-----
Squarehard: I think it's a little more like "Is this representative with a question like "A" "No"?"
-----
shnurgleton: shit is hard
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: No, I don't think so.
-----
Firaga: My question is "Is this representative with a question like "A" "No"?"
-----
Cocolina: no, I don't think so

~!~The most beautiful and scariest movie scenes

Bor Gullet: I've been watching this movie for the last hour. I don't know if it's the best, but it's a scariest scene that I've ever seen.
The scene is set in the future when humanity has adapted to a new era of advanced civilization, and humanity has become the player, exploring the galaxy, carrying out scientific research. The movie is kind of a bummer, but at least I can skip it.
-----
Griselbrand: I always had a soft spot for the "Are You Ready" scene from The Thing.
-----
shnurgleton: It's a decent flick but it's a masterpiece
-----
Chivalry: The Thing is a great movie.
-----
Dicer: I love that it's just a couple of minutes, it's a great movie.
-----
Big Baybee: It's a great movie, but it's a classic for a reason.
-----

Griselbrand: It's never been a movie I've ever seen that has defined a scene for me. It's a movie I always thought was kind of a mish mash of different Sci-Fi movies that maybe weren't meant to be seen together.
I didn't think it was going to be this way but here we are.
-----
Dicer: Yeah I remember it being a classic at the time, but it's too good of a movie to be seen again.
-----
FloatOn: Yeah, that one is great.

~!~Kim Possible: Off-Topic

Pikachu: I've been watching a lot of people's work lately and I'm sad to see them go, but I'm just so fascinated by the weird world of kim possible. I saw the work of people who grew up in the 60s and 70s and even fell in love with it, but I want to see some of what they were up to up to 40 years later.
Who are some of your favorite Kim Possible characters?
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I'll have to look into this. I read about this years ago and I'm a pretty casual watcher, so spoilers to those in the know.
-----
Smurf: my fav soho
-----
DetectiveKenobi: First off, if you want to learn more about their personal lives, I highly recommend the last 2 episodes.
-----
eebster: Yeah, I have a lot of interest in what they were up to.
-----
Aurelius: This is a great shame. 
I remember watching the first season and fucking love all the sketches and sketches from when they started doing Off-Topic. I absolutely loved every minute of it.
-----
Pikachu: I'm with you, I'm sure they'll always be good, but I can't remember them all. I'm really looking forward to this.
-----
BDS: I watched years ago when this was being produced and I remember every minute of it. I'm really not sure what I remember from Off-Topic.
-----
Pikachu: Hahaha
-----
ody: Off-Topic was one of the first Off-Topic shows to ever have its own pilot and not only had a great run of episodes but has many stand outs. I'm really looking forward to this

ElectricBlanketFire: I've been doing some kickboxing every day for the last few weeks.
What are some of your favorite activities?

shnurgleton: Pics
putting posters up on the wall in cubbies
putting t shirts up on the wall in cubbies
-----
Elynn: Hiking out to some local mountain and having a beer sometime.
-----
Sulik2: Camping/wilderness, as I love nature and there is a tener in my town.
-----
PlayALLTheGames: I dunno. Probably hiking, but I also do some local hikes and local waterfalls.
-----
Nerfgun: None really, I like to just relax and enjoy the elements.
I love hiking and I love nature.
-----
Kasai: Hiking back home to my hometown, mostly because I can just relax and take in the experience of it. 
I also have a bachelors in environmental science. 
I love nature, but I love my hometown and I just like to hike/ hike through it.
-----

Strangelove77: I do the usual outdoors things like bird watching, calco trail, etc.
-----
shnurgleton: I do the usual with some friends in a town we are visiting, but sometimes I am just too cheap to get around home

~!~"We live in a society."

Megalosaro: This is the conclusion of a philosophy student interview that was posted today.
"We live in a society," he said. "This is a society. We think we're living in a society. It's a society. We don't think we're living in a society. We think we're living in a society."
I don't know what to take from this. I think I'm getting old.
-----
lazygecko: The term "Social Justice Warrior" is one of the most misrepresented aspects of the word.
-----
Casualcore: I don't know how to take another survey.
-----
Megalosaro: I've never had any group. I've had people i know. I don't see a difference between the people I know and the people I've met.
-----
Dai101: Is this some sort of psychological transfer?
-----
Megalosaro: I personally believe that it's a label used by those with "social justice" in place of "global socialism."
-----
thefit: The concept is that we live in a society. Not everyone is in a society. Some are in a small number of societies. Some are in a global handful. Social Justice Warrior is not generally the same thing.
-----
sphagnum: It's a label used by those with "social justice" in place of "global socialism."
-----
Widdle Puppy: I think you're being very pedantic here
-----
shnurgleton: We are in a society where people with social credit fall down in line groups where they are expected to belong. This is a society that's been around for thousands of years. No amount of video games or money is enough to overcome the chasm like racial caste

~!~The Two Towers - 8-Bit - Free With Friends - 10/31

Mewn: I was just watching TCW this evening and was reminded of the 8-bit show. While it's not a classic, it is a nice product in its own right. I'm hoping others have seen it, and can chime in.
-----
Cheesecakebobby: I watched the show with my GF, and while I like the visuals, the show is pretty poor in their CGI. I'm still more interested in seeing what comes of it (as I'm sure there's already a lot of shows).
-----
Galkinator: The show was on Netflix Canada. Is it on netflix?
-----
Mewn: I watched the first episode a week ago. It was pretty good.
-----
Cheesecakebobby: I had to see it in the cinema to make sure I know what it was called instead of the crappy dub.
-----
Galkinator: It was called the 9 hour show it's on imo. It has been 9 hours and two episodes since it aired.
-----
Mewn: It's a lot better these days in terms of CGI, IMO.
-----
TheBeardedOne: That's not the series I was hoping for. I thought the show was great. I never saw an 8-bit show before, but the show was good.
-----
Cheesecakebobby: I saw it on Netflix internationally and was surprised the dub was so good. It does look amazing.
-----
Mewn: I didn't want to see the show dubbed, but it seems it had some good reviews out there.

~!~A study shows that children with a genetically predisposed love interest who likes them unconditionally are more likely to be able to be happy and end their lives than their non-siblings

Piecake: 
-----
Mimosa97: Something I've never really understood.
-----
Dishwalla: lol lmao
-----
Kurdel: I don't know if I would be happy with getting someone from a dating pool from which I could have a lifelong partner, but I do love my partner.
-----
Kirblar: This is a good study.
-----
Slayven: So if they are already in a relationship it is like letting a dog that was damaged by a vicious attack decide if they love her or not.
-----
Funyarinpa: I'm not sure how you're making this up.
I'm not sure I'd have had the guts to get someone from a relationship from a "daddy country" to be so open and loving. My partner's family country sucks, and my relationship with my family country is also way from the extreme relationship I would have with someone from a "daddy country" because of my father country.
-----
Yerba_Sutra: Yeah, I think I'd be happy with a relationship not only with a partner who is genuinely interested in me but who would also love the person I'm with.
-----
Mimosa97: This. I know love is a deeply human thing, and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy to have a major loss in your relationship with a partner.
-----
Slayven: I mean, they were able to get a girlfriend in high school, and they were able to get a boyfriend in college. Everyone is different, but I am certain I would love someone I didn't have the desire for as much as possible, so I guess I wouldn't be happy with a relationship with a random dog.

~!~The "shout outs" I get at McDonald’s

Douche McBaggins The 4th: One time I went near the drive thru I got yelled at by a customer. I was going home and got a “This McDonald’s is real chicken!” and got yelled at as well. Was thinking if I wanted to get yelled at in the future. I don’t.

~!~Trump: I’m not making excuses for the GOP. Fucking disgusting people.

ElectricBlanketFire: Gee, I wonder why.
-----
onadesertedisland: I'm not surprised. That's a stupid tactic to try to undo all the work of the party.
-----
makonero: That is like saying that if you are involved in the democratic process you are the candidate and therefore the candidate should be the candidate.
-----
Thorn: I love that he's not making excuses for the GOP.
-----
Sagroth: It's a tactic that is being used to attempt to undo progress.
-----
Whitemex: Jesus fucking Christ
-----
SieteBlanco: That's just... disgusting.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I mean, I feel for the US but people very often seem to have a warped sense of a world that has been destroyed by divisions, internal extremism and stupidity. It's a very ineffective strategy that has real tangible benefits, but it's also so much more effective that I don't know where I would stand on the matter when it comes to the general public.
-----
El Bombastico: But he's right.
-----
Thorn: I can separate the Trump from the Right.
I expect Trump to do way better with the GOP than the Democratic Party.

Jarrod38: Yeah this is a hard one.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I remember watching it when it was airing and not when it ended.
-----
jelly: Season 1 is amazing.
Season 2 is a bit of a mess, only maybe 2 or 3 seasons worth of material but the show is great.
-----
Terminus: I’ve watched all of Seinfeld and it’s never occurred to me that it’s the best.
-----
Dekuman: Season 1 is great. Season 2 is one of the best, but you're never gonna see the end of anything.
-----
Hollywood Duo: Season 1 is the best.
-----
Dennis8K: The season was so damn good.

Dekuman: S2 is great, but it's still worth watching.

Taki: Hey guys, please help me get tickets to an onsite bar in Chandler, AZ that I’ve never been to. I’m looking for any recommendations for here in Arizona. I’m in a small town of Chandler, AZ and we’ve never been. 
I’ll just be starting up my google drive and have a blank ticket for this bar. 
Any suggestions? I’m willing to pay. 
Just say you don’t want to be there and I’ll buy you a ticket. 
Thank you for any help.

Bring the ticket to the bar with the info and directions, or just go by phone with a descriptive picture

I'm good but you gotta talk to some college friends 
I'm sure they'll be all right

Taki: Oh, goodness I forgot to mention that 
I didn't know. I'll contact my parents to arrange a pick up day and meet up with the bartender as well, thank you

~!~Second Amendment Rights: A Constitutional Revolution?

Taki: Here’s a long (10,000+ page) history of the latest amendment amendments that have gone nowhere near the courts:
A constitutional revolution is underway. Let’s not let the knick-knack political pendulum of 'protest' time turn into a vicious vicious circle of more extreme and more extreme versions of the same amendment that has actually failed to pass in the first place, or even never failed, over the past century.

These are like the documentaries I was thinking about, except they're on YouTube. What about you?

When I was a teenager I was introduced to the planet Ocean Drive.
I haven't watched it in years but I always thought it was great.

~!~Would you do the opposite of what Trump is doing?

Deleted member 7430: With the US' leadership rapidly devolving into a war of all annihilation, with the recent release of the Parkland school shooting, and the recent news surrounding the Dem NRA members, I'm asking the question that you thought everyone else was asking after the Parkland shooting: Would you do what Trump is doing?
Obviously I'd probably do what I would have to do to support him, but I think you can't just walk away from the idea that it's not in our best interests to do so. 
What do you think of Trump's latest gesture to get us to let this go?
EDIT:
EDIT 2:
-----
Skelepuzzle: I would probably be more likely to let it go, but I think it's not the moral thing to do.
-----
Deleted member 7430: I think he's picking a no-deal, even if it means letting this go.
-----
Slayven: I would get on my high horse and say fuck the current administration, but then I would fall short of helping them
-----
Cryptosporidium: I would probably hold them accountable at the fucking least
-----
Widdle Puppy: Trump would probably veto anything
-----
Ithil: I would vote against letting this go.
-----
The Albatross: I would never vote for something that Trump's done, but I think it's up to him to do what he wants to do: try to get as many people as possible to support him, and make it happen. I'm not really a fan of dictators or dictators' friends, but I think there's a pretty reasonable expectation of people being more or less evil at the same time, and that's what's at the heart of any democracy.
I think if we never had a free and fair electoral process, we'd be on the wrong side of history. If we never did something as despicable/pro-corporate as letting Parkland go, I think we'd be on the wrong side of history, and that's fine by me.
Maybe, but I think Trump's actions have shaken democracy, and it's not okay. I think if we never had a fair and just system, and if we never gave a break to the people who carried on the current admin of the country, and if we never followed through with these

~!~The perfect pair of socks for men

Cranster: I have left socks on for men (I wear them all the time) and I feel really good wearing them all day. I don't know if I'm just a man who's mind likes doing this, or if it's something I can take off my feet. I've been wearing socks all day with ease and it feels really good to have both.

Cocolina: It's the purples

Fulminator: I am not a man

TheBeardedOne: I have never heard of this, but I do sometimes. I don't know why.

Wetwork: I’ve always wondered if it’s the purples or the collar
-----
DJ_Lae: I've always heard the purples as a joke, but I wish I knew for sure.
I've never actually seen any evidence that it's a real thing.
-----
Hollywood Duo: I feel like you are missing out on a lot of key information by just going through the list of options.
-----
Aeana: I don't know OP, so I don't know what to say.

~!~New York City Mayor de Blasio signs $100 million wage increase bill, $100 million tax hikes, $100 million housing tax hike, $100 million marijuana tax hike, $100 million transit tax hike, $100 million fund new transit infrastructure

KSweeley: NY City Mayor Richard P. de Blasio signed one of the largest annual increases in the city's minimum wage to $15.20 per hour, $100 million tax increase on drivers licenses, $100 million in transit infrastructure spending, and $100 million in marijuana tax hike:
-----
Nacho: $100 million in transit infrastructure spending...great!
-----
Greg NYC3: Well good for him.
-----
Richiek: Well, it’s certainly no coincidence that the City of New York is in the process of implementing a new, and most progressive, transit policy.
-----
Stinkles: This is a good thing for voters. De Blasio is going to force this through and somehow, profitably save the city from another recession.
-----
Kirblar: I'm not sure this is a good thing for NYC voters.
-----
KSweeley: I'm not sure if the increased minimum wage is a good thing for NYC voters.
-----
Slayven: They see it as a tax break, and in the case of NYC making it work by the end of the year should be the standard income. I see it as not standard.
-----
Stinkles: The city will have to hire more people to keep the lights on.
-----
moblin: NYC has a minimum wage of $15.20/hr. It's the same in SF and I think SF voters are going to want to see a higher minimum wage.

AztecComplex: I don’t know if I would want her to have more than one career with the Marvel characters.
-----
LakeEarth: I'm with the Cannes and I'm all over her, but I love Tessa Thompson. I feel like I've been waiting a long time for a Marvel artist that’s more like her.
-----
Slayven: I think Green Room is the only Marvel that gives a chance to her. She will do just about anything.
-----
AlteredBeast: Green Room, but a Marvel artist that is more like her is her gold.

~!~What Are Some of the Worst Movies of the Modern Comedy TV Universe? (Such as House Hunters)?

TheRedSnifit: Yeesh, Ricky Gervais' legendary house hunt scenes. I just watched House Hunters and it had me thinking "there is something so heinous and horrifyingly bad that we can’t find out about because it’s on Netflix".
Ricky in this scene from the third season of House Hunters
...

...
Ricky in this scene from the fourth season of House Hunters
...
...
...
...
A classic at heart, and I can't think of any movie where a villain so horrible it's good is actually funny. That's what makes House Hunters so good.
-----
TheRedSnif: I don't know what it is about the movie franchise in itself, but I'm going to assume that most of those scenes are scripted.
-----
Powdered Egg: It's a comedy show about a Game of Thrones murdering child in the dream.
-----
TheRedSnif: It's a bit of a stretch to say there was some good there, but they are still terrible movies.
Like almost all of House of the Dead is terrible, but my god is it so bad it's good. My favorite so far is Night Watch, but I'm not so upset about this.
-----
TheRedSnif: I think the first two seasons are pretty bad, but the show has more to it.
-----
Tsunamo: I think House Hunters is great, but I think it's more ironic the third season is the closest to a good film.
-----
TheRedSnif: I think it's way more interesting from a narrative, than it is from a cutaway cutscene.
-----
lazybones18: I don't think any of the actors/actresses have been in anything this decade without being dragged down in a way I can remember.
-----
TheRedSnif: The 'twist' of the scene is the exact opposite of the tone of the movie.
-----
AegonSnake: I like the first two seasons. Some moments are awesome. (House Hunters is probably my favorite of these tho).
But the show is not a comedy, it's not aimed at a teen. It's a long movie, about four teenagers.

~!~What are the best local hangovers?

shaneo632: Hi friend, I'm from central Ohio and we're having a hangover right now. It's so bad I'm flabbergasted.
I'm six weeks into my 12 week programme and I've got a headache but I think I can handle it.
What are the best local hangovers?
-----
hvysky: Lobster sandwiches are just too messy.
-----
TheCthultist: Okay, so I’ve had quite a few. I’m not really a fan of the greasy bread and the tomato sauce on the bread at all.
-----
nihilence: A good burrito can be tasty.
-----
Dishwalla: pizza is what we have
-----
TheBeardedOne: Pizza and the like
-----
TheBeardedOne: Oh, Pizza and tomato sauce.
-----
Dishwalla: my mom had a hangover from a party once. she had a shawarma with chili in it. we were having that for a while and then her mom said "this is so good."
we're both like "holy shit that looks good". it's not
-----
Pickman: Depends on how much you like pizza. If you're a horror fan, there are a ton of places that are tasty. If you're a picky eater, there's plenty of food options. If you're a sci-fi nerd, there's plenty of food that you can buy and carry cases around.

Stinkles: Tacos, fries, and a couple of chorizo lox.

~!~What is Your Favorite Episode of the TV Series?

Andrew Korenchkin: What is your favorite episode of the television series? I'm just curious. I'll cheat and say I love the ones with Alfred Molina, but I'm also curious about the ones where recurring characters are main focus or if the main actor is a main character.
For me it's the one with the twins, which I think is the most fitting.
-----

TheGreatDirector: I love the final episode of season 5.
-----
TheCthultist: I’m on the “was it a good show” train. I also loved the final episode of season 5 and the one where they try to reunify Elliot and Morgana but unfortunately there’s a scene in the finale that ruins a few of the finale and I’m not talking about that with Alfred.
I also loved the finale and the story tracks of the entire show, and I’m not talking about some kind of final battle. I’m talking about the climactic sequence of the whole thing.
-----
MonadL: Either The Good Wife, the best Friends, or whatever the hell The Good Wife is called.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I'll second The Long Kiss Goodnight, it's a great musical episode from the OP.
-----
BriGuy: I really like/watch The Good Sleep, as a show that's just really well written.
-----
TheCthultist: Between:
Spoiler
-----
TheCthultist: I’m leaning towards The Great Sleep, but you just listed some episodes that are pretty fantastic and all great characters overall.
-----
Aiii: The final episode of season 5, the one where they try to reunite someone they tried to kill.

~!~Has anyone had a heart attack?

Mr. X: My aunt passed away in December and I'm having a heart attack today.
I went into the office today and the receptionist noticed blood and told me that there was a clot and asked me if I had any clotting.
She was telling me that she's had a bad clotting sign in the past and now was getting a little upset that I was telling her I had a bad blood clot.
I asked her if she knew what was happening and she couldn't give any idea and she was just being vague as to what I was talking about.
Her husband then asked me to bring her some stuff, something that was supposed to be wrapped and I brought the stuff with me and put it in the chest compress.
She was lying in bed right now and got a bit stanky, but they said she's ok.
I asked her if she was okay and she was just being vague and then she asked me if I thought she was dying. I was like, "I don't know."
I went over to the receptionist to see what's going on, and she's being better now, but I thought I should at least ask her to be careful, but she didn't answer me.
I went to the receptionist herself, but she seemed to be having a lot of problems.
It's not good for you, you should go to the hospital if it's bad, but the hospital is kinda like a sinking ship at the moment.
-----
Horse Armour: No, but I think I'd be fine.
-----
Bio: Sorry sorry sorry don't know if it's good for you but it's not good for your wife, so you should talk to her first.
-----
Shugga: Maybe you should call the hospital
-----
Mr. X: I don't know what exactly happened to her but I learned that she was having a bad clot, so maybe I should call the hospital.
-----
Galkinator: I don't know, I'm pretty sure it's not good for your wife to have a bad clot.
And the hospital itself is not like the receptionist or whatever, it's literally a fucking tank of fucking stank.
-----
Airegin: I don't know what happened but I had a bad yachtsmoker and I had to pass the hospital.

~!~How do I get an email when I use Edge (Mac)?

Grunge_Hamster: Ok, so I've always used Gmail, I don't really need that much more than that, but I just can't help myself with that one line message:
"Wtf is this?"
I recently got an email about a new home theatre system for my living room, and I thought it was an awesome idea, so I set it to send this message.
But then the same thing follows:
"HHH, 
My email is [email protected] and this time it's [email protected].
"Haha, hH, that's not okay!"
I don't know what really prompted this, but I just can't figure it out. Is it a phone message that was sent out to someone else and was this their first response? Or is there some kind of secure form of email?
-----
Notaskwid: Tried a couple different websites, try Outlook.com, outlook.com. All work fine.
-----
Jims: Outlook is a mess and I can't imagine being in that situation or having to send that nonsense to [email protected]. 
But on the plus side, theres no reason to just get a phone number and start spoofing.

Walter White Walker: Outlook is totally fine. Just make sure you have u.s on hand.

El Bombastico: I'll go with the anime that got me to cheer for Super Saiyan Blue: The Series U.S. Premiere.
It's a ridiculously well done and well directed anime that takes place in the year 3000 or so years. It has a nice atmosphere and interesting characters.
It has a killer sound that's amazing for a show that's about space travel.
It's also got one of the greatest songs of all time, "Space Divers", which is also fantastic.

~!~Anyone have a bug bite outbreak?

seiki: I feel pretty bad that I have a lot of bugs in my house but last week I had a few in the garage and they got all kind of nasty. I had the shrub bug I had growing on me and I hated it but the cow's been dead for like 7 days I thought it was maybe just a cow or something. 
last night I opened the garage door and I heard some air when I heard some crackling and splashing. I looked up to see a bunch of them in there but when I opened the door it was all over the house. They are pretty nasty. I wonder if it is one of those "newborn" bugs that is just not growing any more but the old bugs where they stay for a few weeks.
Anyone have one? What was it like?
-----
John Rabbit: I have never had one, but my brother does, and I've had some in the past. They're harmless as far as I know.
-----
Ogodei: I don't know. My uncle had one in his backyard and I've never seen him with one. It's just the smell.
-----
Gorgamel: I have one in his garden, next to the garage. I had one once, a few weeks later it was already a dead (I had a bit of a scratch on me).
-----
Shadybiz: I have a dead ruffles in my yard. There are other bugs floating around in the yard that I think are harmless, but it is the house bugs.
-----
weemadarthur: I had an orange ruffled that was soaking wet and smelled like sweat in the garage, so I cut it off and used a wet washcloth to keep everything off.
-----
Saganator: The best advice I ever heard for a house bug outbreak is to just call the exterminators and never let them live outside for a day. It's really, really bad.
-----
echoshifting: I had a shrub bug bite about 10 years ago. I don't know if it was a common one, but I had a few too. I had to call the exterminators and they tried to stop it from dying.
-----
ronco2000: I had a few in the garage I had to cut out because no one was home so I had to cut open the trash

The Albatross: I don't think there's anything that can separate fact from fiction in this day and age.
I do think it's important to be able to trust our institutions, though.

Francois Dillinger: I don't think this is a good thing. If anything, it's important that we also give the right people a platform to trash others for their beliefs, and let them speak their minds.

~!~Do you like the use of the naked eye?

fireflame: I have always been curious about it. I believe that I still suffer from a very serious condition called uvemal astigmatism. I have never been able to see myself in the mirror, so I have always been wondering if I am actually addicted to seeing myself. I can see myself in my body, but I feel that I am addicted to my body in the sense that I can have those weird phyches I have in the shame of having their ements on my face. I also have no idea what I'm doing. I feel that I feel that I am being "taught" but I don't know what to do with myself. I don't feel comfortable teaching others about how to use the naked eye. I feel like I have to be untouchable because I feel that I need to be able to feel normal for others.
I have read that it is important that people do not feel ashamed about their bodies but also about that they sometimes feel that they are being taught that body is shameful. I feel that if we are taught that body, it will lead to self hatred. I feel that we should learn to deal with our shame properly and live a life not filled with body parts, but I think that we should avoid prideful bodies. I think that we should teach ourselves that we are good and we should live what we are taught to think is good. I do not believe that we should take pride in who we are or that we should be ashamed that we do not look fully healthy. I feel that we should teach ourselves that we are good and that self love should be real and that we should live life to learn to love our bodies.
I have also read that self love is important and that we should live life to learn to love ourselves. I feel that we should teach ourselves that we are good and that self love should be livingly. I also read that we should learn that we are connected to and relate to others who live life to learn to love themselves. I feel that we are in a life where we are all billions of times more complex than our body.
I feel that we have no chance against society that is corrupt or bad. I feel that we have a chance that is not guaranteed by any real world country, that is not by any real life people, that is not by any real life chemistry, that is by any real life intelligence.

~!~How long would it take for an adult to be "grown out" ?

BAD: I think it varies from person to person. I’ve been in my mid 30s and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not worth it. I grew out of it due to being a female and realizing I was not getting the same opportunities as my male peers. The real life came afterwards and I realized I’m pretty much only attractive one-to-ones all the time.
How long would it take you for an adult to be mature enough to say that? I’ve been around 30-40 for the past few years and have not seen anyone in my age group be like me. I think we’re all mature enough, but I guess that’s just what adults want to hear.
-----
Kuro: I feel like I'd be bored if I were 30.
-----
Birdseye: Your first years are going to be rough.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: You don’t have to be. It happens. Especially when you are in your 20s.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'm 40 and I've been around 30-45 for a few years now. I'm definitely not the "adult" anymore. I'm actually quite mature and have matured a lot as well.
-----
Renna Hazel: I'd be perfectly fine as a 30-something.
-----
Puck Beaverton: I’ll give it a go
-----
chandoog: I think I'd be past 20 for sure.
-----
Jessie: I’ll pass
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'll be 60 when I'm 30, but I've been around 30-40 for a while and have not seen anyone turn me down. 
I'm also only 30, too. I have a thing for 30-40 year olds. I've also learned to check my body as well as my mind.

~!~Interesting, obscure, or out-of-the-way properties

grmltr: What are interesting hobbies and what are non-borate or obscure or out-of-the-way properties? I'm curious to learn what you guys think are interesting and obscure.
For example, I'm trying to understand why people gravitate towards golf courses and golf is such a fascinating hobby, but I'm not sure where to start. I suppose I could look at it as a series of holes, round and rectangular, with the round being exactly where a hole ends and the rectangular hole being spread across the round. Might look at a website to learn more about it and put together a round, but I'm not sure how to get an overall impression of it.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: A combination of A&B's and Youtube.
-----
grmltr: Thanks, Grmltr!
Not sure what series you're talking about, but I don't think you have enough knowledge to know any of these properties. I'm also not sure if your question is a genuine one.
-----
CrazyAndy: I just got done watching water slide and the only interesting thing about it is that the course is 2 miles wide and that the courses are round.
-----
grmltr: Awesome, thanks for keeping the discussion going. I'm not sure where to start, I'm just not sure where to look :P 
I'll look into those. I'm not sure of anything that is at least somewhat fascinating.
-----
A Wild Ambulance Appears: Of course I have the knowledge. I’m not sure where to start but I’ve been told to look for things about golf and A&B.
-----
grmltr: A very good start

Linkark07: I'm not sure about anything, but I do have the knowledge.

~!~What are the best (or most incorrect) anime characters?

Thewonandonly: So recently I’ve been watching anime and one of the things that keeps coming up is the characters are all pretty much the exact same as they appear in real life. It’s usually pretty entertaining and the only thing that comes out as close to the same level as them is the fact that they’re absolutely the same person every episode.
I’ve been watching anime and it keeps coming up with more and more anime characters I think are the same person in anime but are way more exaggerated or even worse.
What are the best or most incorrect anime characters?
And any that are close to the same person in anime and not the same person in life?
Edit: Not really a spoiler for this list but it’s a huge list to just list everything and not add a poll.
-----
Hypron: Akira is one of the best examples.
-----
Cantaim: Steins;Gate
-----
Thewonandonly: I’m really trying to learn about this. I’m not sure I like toriko but I’ll try it later! I’m not sure I like the premise of this list to begin with.
-----
Cocolina: Boruto
-----
A Fish Aficionado: Dragon Ball
-----

MochaKoffee: One Piece
-----
Rover: Naruto has to be the most correct.

~!~What is your "perfect" movie to watch?

SolVanderlyn: This is just a random thought I had on Reddit. I usually just watch movies from people who like them, but I've seen a ton of movies that are good, have been re-released, or are in an alternate continuity.
For me, I have to go with The Big Lebowski. I think it's a movie that takes the concept of the movie and turns it into something more than just a popcorn flick. It's a more complex movie about relationships and sex, but it's also about freedom and exploring the world. It's got a very strong climax after a while.
Anyways, what movies are you usually interested in to watch that are not already available to you?
-----
Deleted member 37107: The Dark Knight. I love the Batman, but I also love the Dark Knight as much as the other protagonists.
-----
Alastor3: The Dark Knight, because the first two in particular had me in high school.
-----
Hjod: The Lost State.
It's not a movie specifically, but one of my favorite TV shows ever.
-----
Platy: The original Goonies
-----
Kurita: The original Sopranos
-----
Mona: The original Lord of the Rings
I think a lot of people really like the original LOTR
-----
Clydefrog: Star Wars
-----
Quinton: Lord of the Rings
-----
Comrade Crunch: The Dark Crystal.
Thirty five years ago. It's a great film that I have a soft spot for every film I watch now.

====================
~!~What are your thoughts on white dying?

Squarehard: This is something that has always intrigued me, and it's kind of a strange point to talk about in this thread, because in a world where we know that Black Death is happening, I just don't feel like it's actually about White dying.
I've always seen it as a white man's take on Death, which is an entirely different take entirely.
I was talking with my GF's fiance, and she mentioned that she had always thought that White dying was a joke about Black Panther's premise, and how she was always told that a Black person's life in this world wasn't really so different from other people, and that it's basically like a "they're just different" sort of thing.
This really made me think about the context of this in a different way, because I don't really think about Death as anything other than a hypothetical situation, and it really made me kind of uncomfortable for the sake of conversation.
Was this just a reaction you had? Is this just an attempt to paint the pop-culture equivalent to Black Death, and how would it change any of it's meanings?
-----
darz1: People are different. Different rations of things. It is a choice especially when it could be reversed easily.
It is also a choice even when it is not a choice.

Khanimus: It's a choice.

SageShinigami: This was my first thought too.

~!~Favorite books, movies, and games

Morrison71: I have a huge collection of classic books and movies. I’m not sure what to get. I don’t know the name for all of them but I think The Three Cabrials and The Killing of a Sacred Deer and Gone With The Wind are my favorites. I have a lot more to choose from so far. 
1. Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri - One of my favorite movies, but I think The Irishman also has some really unique stories. I think I like The Three Billboards more. 
2. The Wizard of Oz - I really like this movie. The characters are super interesting and the story is super cool too. I also really like The Three Billboards. 
3. The Thing - I think it’s the most famous movie. I think it’s a classic and it’s probably the most nominated movie of all time. 
I was just curious what Era’s books/games on a broader spectrum of books/games are like. I personally believe I am a very introspective and pessimistic person so I don’t think I am the type to pick and choose books that fit all my criteria. 
Thanks in advance for any answers.
-----
NekoFever: A good book for a basic (fiction) summary of the events. The Abridged is a more scientific and introspective one, but I think it works better as a series, so you'll get more detail information based on those.
The Life Cycle of Ender's Game is great.
-----
Morrison71: Thanks for the response. I was wondering if there was any other ones I could get into for this. I tried my luck at Amazon and they had a lot of books out, but haven't picked anything in like over a year.
-----
Haloid1177: I like The Forever War, The Fireman, and The Patronages. A lot of sci-fi stuff.

~!~The most overrated movies of the past decade?

vatstep: I was talking to some friends about The Last Jedi, and I was curious on The opinions of movie die hards on this topic. I love the movie, but it's also overrated. You can't compare it to anything like The Dark Knight Rises or Fury Road.
For example, it's a great movie (only slightly over a decade old, can't think of a box office-wise taste since it's a classic) but it's overrated to say the least.
It's also a bad movie, and was overrated from a financial POV. It's (a) pretty comprehensive, (b) has a good script, (c) doesn't have a ton of behind the camera work, and (d) is an ensemble movie that does a lot of good stuff. It's a classic, but it's a little overrated?
What movies have you seen that are overrated?
-----
Khanimus: I mean, for a time, Dark Knight was a very good movie, but it's overrated by an incredible margin.
-----
Cocolina: It's too busy getting the best actors
-----
itwasTuesday: The Walkman.
It's overrated to say the least.
-----
mreddie: The GOAT
-----
Eidan: The Matrix.
