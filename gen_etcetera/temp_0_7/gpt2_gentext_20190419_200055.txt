~!~What's the most important piece of news you have been told?

Ryuhza: I have several pieces of news, some important and some just irrelevant.
The news I've been telling my family basically all of December 2017, when Trump was in office. I told them he'd be the one to initiate a trade war, the ones that were the real danger to our country.
The day after the election.
I was listening to a podcast that was about the "Closer Look" (a study showing the Trump admin had a political bias towards blacks and against women), and a BBC producer mentioned that the family he was telling my family about the MeToo allegations had gone to the library. I told him I was going to go there to check it out, but I was a bit afraid of what I'd do.
The day after the election.
I was also going to go to a children's book launch, but I got declined by the staff at the restaurant.
I'm at this point where I'm concerned about what's going on with my life, and I don't like to think that it's going to end badly.
I'm not so concerned about Trump, or the GOP, which is a disgustingly white party. The GOP has been going down a racist path for generations, and I think Trump is white enough that the GOP is too, and can be, handled with some care.
What about you?
-----
Foffy: I'm not American.
The only news sources I trust are Era and GAF.
-----
Volimar: I don't think I've been told anything I can be sure of.
-----
subpar spatula: I've been told a ton of things that I would have never ever heard of.
-----
Foffy: That the press conference where the reporter made fun of the fact that she was not interested in my birthday is something.
-----
Doom_Bringer: it's pretty obvious when you think about it, the GOP. i've been told things my entire life and never have any major political stances.
-----
808s & Villainy: I'm pretty sure the whole point of the internet was that information is "caught / influenced" but that in reality is just noise. Now we have this "daily show" news that is completely unveriapt black and white for everyone?

~!~Apple says it removed Watchface and removed the 'Touch ID' option

MosquitoSmasher: I'm personally a big fan of Touch ID, I would like to think that Touch ID will eventually become standard anyways but the idea of a new standard is interesting but I'm not sure if it's going to happen anytime soon.
I do like that it's easier to use my fingerprint to get around the wrist band, I do like how the trackpad is now no longer an option (I had issues with it before but I jumped ship anyway)
-----
faceless: that's pretty cool of them. they can't possibly have removed them in the future.
-----
Mortimer Brewster: I had a weird issue where I asked for both the Touch ID and the 'Touch Match' option to appear and the Apple staff said "Oh we don't want to let people use them."
I don't know where that comes from. Apple keeps saying "the Touch ID feature is what's missing from the current Watch."
-----
MosquitoSmasher: I'm waiting for the official announcement on the Apple store, it will be released sometime in the next few days
-----
Kurdel: It's pretty damn awesome, I wish they would make it more intuitive for people who just need a normal wrist trackpad, or want to do a more complex setup.
-----
Megatherium: Isn’t this just for Apple because that’s what the Apple Watch is supposed to do?
-----
MosquitoSmasher: It's just the normal trackpad, I believe. I know Apple doesn't want to make it harder for people to use it, I think that's what's supposed to happen.
-----
lmcfigs: I'm not interested in Touch ID sadly. I'm sure they'll do it better next time.
-----
Lunchbox-: the last release went ape and chased Macs with a claw instead of a normal wrist trackpad.
-----
MosquitoSmasher: Yep, it was a common thing for a few months, I've had it for a while now.
-----

====================
~!~Was It the Winter Soldier or The Winter Soldier?

Gustaf: The movie was released in Winter of 1984.
Winter Soldier is the main protagonist.
Winter Soldier came out in 2005.
Winter Soldier is the main villain.
Winter Soldier came out in 2013.
-----
Uzumaki Goku: The Winter Soldier
-----
Cybersai: Winter Soldier
Winter Soldier is not really the main villain.
Winter Soldier came out in 2010 and is not really the main villain either.
-----
Gustaf: I think Winter Soldier is the main villain but Winter Soldier is basically the main villain in the sense that Winter Soldier is basically a father figure.
-----
Torpedo Vegas: Winter Soldier
Winter Soldier comes in close second
-----
BreezyLimbo: A Winter Soldier staring in wonder cannon
-----
HamCormier: Winter Soldier is not the main villain, but he's the protagonist.
Winter Soldier comes in close second.
-----
WadiumArcadium: Yeah, I'm with it. The Winter Soldier is the main villain, but he's also basically the father figure.
-----
echoshifting: Winter Soldier comes in close second.
-----
tormented: Winter Soldier is the protagonist but probably doesn't have much of a father figure.

~!~A new payment option for every child entering adulthood has been discovered

signal: The Guardian
-----
Fat4all: "My children will be born in the next five years"
-----
Dice: It's a zero tolerance society. No payment on a term-limited basis, no payment on an indefinite period.
-----
Akira86: Zero acceptance, no need for parental input.
-----
Krejlooc: yes, no need for parental input.
-----
Yoshimitsu126: Yes, because if I don’t get my kid the last 5 years I will have a kid.
-----
Neece: Zero acceptance?
-----
Krejlooc: I think it's quite simple. You pay your period of residency and if you do not renew your registration by the due date, your child will be born in the next 5 years.
-----
Fat4all: does this mean that my kid is born in the next 5 years, or does this limit the amount of time your child will be born in the next 5 years
-----
Krejlooc: my wife and I are mulling over this idea, because we just received two letters from the embassy that says that we have to renew our registration in the next 5 years.
-----

====================
~!~Wrestling fans: the most extreme moments?

Wag: I'm not a big wrestling fan, but I've seen a lot of extreme moments in wrestling.
The most egregious is probably the Undertaker vs Brian Pillman feud.
-----
The Almighty Tria: Rude is he?
-----

Aquavelvaman: The Undertaker's "stupid ass" comment was top tier
-----

Torpedo Vegas: The Big Drew is my favorite match of all time, and for good reasons.
-----
NinjaScooter: Undertaker's "we'll have to see how many rubber he can hold" comment was some kind of joke
-----
Lashley: The brawl in NJPW Raw was a little too out there for me to place in his career.
I was hoping for something a bit more extreme
-----
Lashley: The Undertaker was just so great in that match
-----
Gonzalez: Back when I watched WWF on TV in the early 00's I remember having a dream about Hogan loving Spieth. 
He was a great, big floppy man that could also be a bit crazy, as well.
-----

====================
~!~Apple's HomePod is on the Humble Store

Blackbanditsho: I have a HomePod and I think this is really awesome.
$250 for the 4.0 compatible model, $500 for the 9.0 version. I've used it on a HomePod 2 via Apple Music and it's been great.
-----
Knight613: I've never bought a HomePod, but this is cool.
-----
Jpop: I need to try it, but I'm not too sure on the particular settings it's supposed to support.
-----
Gattsu25: I've used it on two different HomePod's and it was pretty awesome.
-----
Blackbanditsho: It's not as good as the Sonos Play 1 which I thought was a little crap too.
-----
jett: It's decent for the price and I'd say upgrade from an older (but decent) HomePod to an Apple HomePod.
-----
Squarehard: It's a nice, nice piece of tech.
-----
Kensation: I'm down to get the Play 1
-----
Drewton: This is awesome
-----
Jpop: Honeycomb.
Light, Works with both Siri and Alexa.
-----

====================
~!~Who is your favorite type of Pesto?

Squarehard: Yeah, it's pretty much a regular pesto, but if you're looking to get serious with it, and just want to clean up your house, who is the best type of pesto?
What say, ERA, who is your favorite type of pesto?
-----
staedtler: I guess it depends on the size and variety of it. 
And also how much work you have to do if you want to do all those fancy house stuff.
-----
Fat4all: i like
-----
thesoapster: It's regular, but my girlfriend bites me when she sees it. Kinda hard to take him as a partner when he's so big.
-----
HStallion: Its the best. I love having them as a part of my daily routine in most situations.
-----
Jombie: They're the best.
-----
Volimar: They're the best.
-----
Frecklestein: The worst.
-----
KillstealWolf: Well this thread is out of time, but I'm looking for some more Pesto inspired ideas.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: I like it

~!~"The Dark Knight Rises" to be released under the Disney banner

Scullibundo: Surprised Nolan's leaving this universe for Burton. Very curious to see how this movie is received in the U.S.
-----
Khanimus: Dark Knight Rises to be released by Disney
-----
yuoke: That seems like a real shame in a good way.
-----
Kgamer: I really hope they don't fuck up the pacing of the movie.
-----
Tom_Cody: That sounds like a dumb idea.
-----
AxeVince: A YAASSSS!
-----
Dice: I'm glad Nolan is finally leaving this universe. It was depressing and messy at the time but seeing it's own trilogy with Dark Knight as the big bad was a cool fun ride.
-----
BreezyLimbo: good shit, Disney
-----
CopperPuppy: I'm so confused right now
-----
Travo: That's dope. I had never seen it. 
I wonder if this means that Nolan will be joining the MCU.

Guzim: What a mess.
-----
jelly: I'm ready for this.
-----
AndreGX: Looks like a horror movie, BTW
-----
Slayven: I thought this was a comic
-----

====================
~!~I just watched "The Dark Knight" for the first time in a long time...

Hate: I felt that was the right word. It was weird that a movie like that I watched so long ago and yet I remember it quite vividly now. 
This movie feels like a lot of Nolan's stuff from the 70's. I remember thinking that it was great, but I definitely remember it being like a lot of Nolan's stuff. 
What about you era? What movies did you first watch/read/read at the same time when watching it?
-----
JustSurvive: I watched Batman: The Animated Series a year after it came out and it was the first movie I actually liked. I thought it was wonderful.
-----
Mugy: The first batman was really weird, but I didn't mind it that much
-----

Stiler: I just watched a Red Dead Redemption 2 movie a couple weeks ago, it was the one that really got me. I thought it was really good and I liked the narrative structure and the cast and worldbuilding.
-----
Hate: I thought it was even better. That movie was so bad I remember thinking it was a masterpiece.
-----
Bonefish: I still have the Nolan Batman TAS anniversary if I remember correctly
-----
Hate: Yeah, I'll be going to see it tomorrow. I used to enjoy a few of his Red Dead comics but I missed some. Maybe more people should check them out.
-----
Seesaw15: I watched a lot of Remini. I thought it was fine but it was just boring.
-----
Jedeye Sniv: I think the first Batman was fine. I liked the artwork and the world. I don't remember hating the movie. I don't necessarily like the Superman stuff. I just liked the movie. I just think it was bad.
-----

====================
~!~John Wick trilogy: "The Beach Bum"

Bor Gullet: Bogus:
John Wick 3:
The beach bum:
-----
Khanimus: The Beach Bum is the first of a trilogy I'm excited to see.
-----
Cocolina: The beach ba buum is definitely the first
-----
MMarston: The Beach Bum
-----
Pachimari: The Beach Bum is definitely the best part of the film. It's a fun, tense thriller that never loses it's exciting twists.
-----
TrailerParkRanger: Beach baum is the shit, but The Beach Bum is a great scene that brings the action to a whole new level.
-----
Bor Gullet: The very first scene with Wick taking on the jungle and killing some fish.
-----
TrailerParkRanger: I know that. I was totally wrong.
-----
Sapiens: Beach baum is the worst part of the movie. The fight scene with the fish isn’t even the worst part of the movie.
-----
Landy828: I'm not a huge fan of this.
The beach baum is a great scene in there, but the fight scene with Wick on the boat is worse.
-----

ElectricBlanketFire: It's just a matter of time.

DeeDogg: I don't know trump is good at his job. It's work.

====================
~!~Why are the Japanese Prime Ministers just called "Keikaku"

fireflame: In a place called Takubine, the people calling the Japanese people "Keikaku" are now called "Keikaku-sama". It is quite surprising that the same politicians from the other countries are called "Keikaku" without the i in them. It is a shame that a nation can so easily be called out.
-----
Tokutaro: The Japanese have had a similar problem with "Usuitable" as France did with the people in the 1660's.
It is similar to what has happened with the American President calling birther BS.
-----
SRG01: We should try framing it as a deliberate act of manipulation by the US.
-----
Ogodei: Because it's "politics" at work. This is literally a "hardline politician", who's line is too much to ask.
-----
Respawn: He's a politician and the prime minister is Shinzo Abe, the current Prime Minister of Japan.
This is a blatant attempt to take money from the stock market.
-----
wisdom0wl: Abe is selling his youth for the Japanese to look like greedy old men
-----
Richter1887: Because they are both being threatened by the US.
-----
fireflame: So Takubine is also using the same tactic of calling the leaders of Brazil and France "Keikaku"
-----
SG-17: I can't remember the last time there was a politician called out.
-----

====================
~!~What do you think of the movie "Inception"

CoolestSpot: It's not just one of the most acclaimed, but probably the most well known movie ever made.
It's a masterpiece, but that makes it more interesting to me.
It's a pretty amazing movie but it's not a masterpiece by any means.
I want to know what the general consensus is.
-----
Khanimus: The movie is not better than Interstellar (which is very good)
It's not my favorite movie of the year.
-----
PlanetSmasher: I think it's really good, but it's not as good as Interstellar. 
I feel like it's a lot better in ways that the original doesn't.
-----
CoolestSpot: Also, I feel like the movie is just as good as the original, but if it gets a little better I would still call it better.
-----
FireSafetyBear: I love “the” original.
-----
WrenchNinja: It's pretty good but the plot is a bit clunky.
-----
foxuzamaki: I think it's awesome is how it ends that way, but the movie is so good that I would still consider it better than the original
-----
JackFrost: I love the movie, but I think the plot is a bit clunky.
-----
Cyanity: It's well regarded, but the original was just too methodical and boring.
And that ending was absolutely gorgeous. I'm not sure what I think of the movie except for the plot and Harrison Ford.
-----
Einchy: It's better than Interstellar.

~!~Shutterfly reviews and options

BrokenFiction: So this is a sad article from me from today.
The movie is a masterpiece, and I'm a sucker for seeing how the whole concept was created. I was hoping for a more whimsical take on the concept but this looks like something I would actually like. I can't believe this is still a thing?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Out of all the movies I've seen so far, this seems like a more interesting movie than The Dark Knight.
-----
Thunder11: I don’t see how this is a good movie

-----
HStallion: I'm in for this. In for the third weekend of winter competition competition.

I would have to take my time to listen to a podcast, make a google doc or some sort of documentary to adequately put myself through these thoughts. I don't want to be like some kind of movie star.

Inglorious Man: So I recently found a new toilet and I can’t flush. I’ve suggested using warm water and a tissue, like a slip, my God.
I’m not sure what the consensus here is exactly but it’s pissing me off because I’ve never seen this. I also wouldn’t say I don’t like it, but I’ve never seen it or heard of it.
-----

Inglorious Man: I’m not sure what the consensus is here (aside from the fact that it’s not a public toilet) but I’m just surprised people don’t say it’s disgusting.

~!~Quick Note: Where do I buy albums?

Halo 2: Ok, so I have a few albums I want to keep and I need some quick note like where do I buy one of them?
I buy a lot of them old albums (all around era) that I really like.
I just want to be informed of what's going on in the world and to know whats good (or cheap) music.
So I wanted to ask what's out there.. and what are some of the best songs of the 90s?
Who do I contact for help?
Why do I have to contact you in advance?
What's the best way to get informed?
How can I fill out the online form if I'm not aware of what's out there?
Do I need to go to a store?
What's a good music store?
How do I get my facts wrong?
What's your go to store?
What's the best way to get things that are not labeled correctly?
What songs are you listening to that you can't listen to off the radio alone?
I am thinking of going the convenience route.
What's the best way to get the most bang for your buck?
What's the most way to get some cheap $$$?
What's the best way to get the most inexpensive music?
What's the most inexpensive online form for music that is not a jacket of inferior, expensive music?
My first question is... what do I need to get on the internet for those of you who don't know what a jacket of inferior music is?
I would suggest going there first.

What do you guys think of them?
They're not the most premium ones to get, but there is some value for the price.

TheGamingNewsGuy: As we have a lot of threads on this topic - here it goes. 
I'll start off with a few examples of anime I am enjoying -
-----
Panther2103: I'm not sure if JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a good idea, but I did watch the first episode of Season 1 and it was fun.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah I saw it was a great idea and tried to watch season 2 so I am sure I will watch the rest
-----
SigmasonicX: Not sure if when exactly it was finished but it seems like it was in May of 2009.
-----
Fulminator: Saw the first episode on Vue Japan and was blown away. I don't remember if it's still available though lol
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes!
-----
Neoxon: I watched the first episode. I didn't particularly like it. The next few episodes didn't do much for me, but I enjoyed it. It was a long series, but I really liked it.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah, the first season was pretty bad and it became way too verbose too late for my liking
-----
Neoxon: I think the reason why I don't remember a lot of what the show was is because I was in high school, but on the evening of my graduation I was in a short bus ride and there was a guy in a monkey costume on the bus. He's got a long ass face that I think he must have worn a mask, but I can't find it.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah I think it was a fairly old anime but not that old that people remember it. It's got some good old times content and it's about the same age as JoJo Part 5

~!~I'm sorry, I'd like to know what it was like when you were younger

TissueBox: Some of you may remember me from my love of music, movies, video games, and TV shows.
I'm the proud homeowner of a small NYC neighborhood. We put all of our money down on the house it was in and paid for it, and we actually have the house next to ours ready to be built in a bit (not that it matters, but I think we'll be able to put up the garages on the area in time for when we get the building done).
Some of you may remember me from a bit. ' (I'm a savage, so close behind my wife and I at least.)
I just want the world to remember me, for the good of ERA.
-----
RolandOfGilead: I was raised in a pre-War era, my parents were musicians, my dad was a mechanic.
I'm plenty of things to be thankful for in the world, even though I probably could have done more.
-----
Admiral Woofington: I was a child. I don't want to be what I was.
-----
Mendrox: I was born in 1941 for "What the fuck?" "Where's my parents?". And what I'm hoping for in the future.
-----
Ithil: I was a child.

Brakkelelig: I am just a kid. 
But I was a kid.

~!~The Grand Tour: The Next 10 years The Next 20 years

Spikematic: With the yearly Mazda recalls and the news of a new generation of RX10s coming, I figured now would be a good time to remind people that the next decade is off, how it is the last decade for the best off the line of cars on the market.
I've always enjoyed watching the series and going on my way to discover and appreciate the best parts of the series while I'm there, but I've never seen the most popular off beat protags like Hakodic or Kishi.
I'm instead looking for those deserving of the best. What you got?
(I've been watching the series for the last decade, so can probably confirm this is the best year for RX10s in the off years)
-----
Brock Reiher: The series has better cars so it's not as bad as the 2000s
-----
Vincent Alexander: I'm glad I'm not a Y2K2 and go with the RX5, but I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea to be getting one in the next decade.
-----
Mushroomer25: This is my favorite year of the series.
-----
OneEightZero: I'm happy I am not buying another Toyota Corolla.
-----
Mushroomer25: Except for the Honda RAV3, which is a good car.
-----
Razgriz417: yes this is it.
I'm 35 now. I'm not sure why I was so happy to get a new RX car in the next decade.
-----
Silentbomber: I would love to go back and own some Chinese brand chinese lol
-----
des0lar: I'm glad I'm not buying another Toyota Corolla.
I don't know how else to explain this.
-----
Mushroomer25: Cars has been on the decline for a long time now. Hondas, Infiniti, etc.

~!~Anecdotally watching this on Hulu

Krejlooc: I'm a pretty big fan of the show, but I don't remember the show quite as much as a few of the videos in this youtube channel. I'm pretty sure I only watched about 30% of it, which is an okay mark for a comedy show.
I remember the show was great, too.
-----
Krejlooc: I think the best part was when the host really thought everyone was in on the joke.
-----
riotous: I enjoyed it.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Watched it a lot when I was younger.
The premise is pretty original, too.
-----
Krejlooc: It's a comedy, but I think if it's on Hulu, it's a comedy.
-----
Lys Skygge: I’m on Hulu and enjoyed it.
-----
cj_iwakura: I watched it some years ago. I still haven't seen it in about 20 years.
-----
Krejlooc: I think it's one of those comedy shows that is just one side of a joke, but the host tries to think it's funny. A lot of the jokes are just unanderate. Not every joke is funny.
-----
riotous: The host was trying to be funny?
-----
Krejlooc: I think it's the host trying to be funny. The joke is that his nose is a little bit wavy. The humor is not that funny.

~!~The latest Inuyasha pilot teaser

Arthands: The pilot for this newest season of Inuyasha is out, and it seems that it will premiere today on Toonami. The teaser is NSFW, but you can see the actual poster's character posing nude (in case you haven't seen it)
Apparently the image creator wanted to use only human parts, but he also wanted to use only the breasts.
-----
ILikeFeet: the penis
-----
Yams: I really like this show
-----
Travo: Pornhub.
-----
GAMEPROFF: Thats not even the worst part
-----
HStallion: Its easily one of the worst things I have ever watched. It is absolutely disgusting, but hey no it doesn't make me want to gag.
-----
GAMEPROFF: I mean the preview is on toonami.com
-----
Arthands: I found the image disturbing, but it's only on there for second half of the preview and the first half is still not over.
-----
BreezyLimbo: What's with the nudity?
-----
Bones Conspicuously: If it's on there right now, would you want to gag?

~!~NYT: House passes resolution calling for investigation of White House finances

Wondergal: Good stuff. Not sure what to expect going forward.
-----
Fiction: Not really sure what you're asking for, but this is a good start.
-----
Razorrin: good, hopefully more legislation can come from the GOP congress.
-----
shadowsdarknes: The deep and obvious fuckery with regards to healthcare is so ridiculous.
-----
Dyle: I don't want to say it's a good thing, but this adds further evidence of how deep the swamp is, and shows that Trump is a real mess.
-----
WedgeX: Wonder what the resolution’s ultimate backers are.
-----
Eidan: Good.
-----
Tfritz: what are the chances this is just a PR stunt, and not an actual illegal act by Trump?
-----
BWoog: Democrats will bring up a bill that includes universal health care, and trump will tweet about how he's doing great and everyone will be "great".
-----
Netherscourge: Good.
Fair.

~!~How do you feel about blowing a small battery away?

Coraline Jones: I’m in an apartment and the battery is about to drain. I’m just wondering how common it is. It’s been raining heavily lately, so I’m thinking of blowing it away.
How do you feel about it?
-----
Swimming: I've never blown it, but I read that if you do it would prevent future heart attacks.
-----
Rocketz: I do it with just one battery.
-----
CthulhuSars: I do it to save me a battery replacement.
-----
Praxis: I've blown it once, not because I thought it would be a good idea, but because my insurance company thought I was the one to cause the flooding. They decided to hold off on the bill and let me deal with it.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I haven't blown it but I plan to in the future.
-----
Dest: It's the best way for me.
-----
Kapryov: I blow it when I'm swimming.
Waves are, in my opinion, not the best at switching batteries.
-----
Nude_Tayne: I do it because I like how the air in my room changes from wet to dry very quickly.
-----
CitizenVectron: I don't blow it but the first few days are torture. After that, I just suck it up.

~!~Avengers Infinity War's biggest profit goes to Thanos

Vonnegut: Infinity War is valued at $6.5 billion dollars at the moment.
Thanos' entire film production costs are estimated at $3.1 billion dollars.
This means that, through today's date, Thanos will at least be profitable with a profit of $6.5 billion dollars, and will be the most profitable movie in the MCU.
I think it's probably safe to say that the movie is probably the highest-grossing movie of all time, aside from Avatar.
-----
Dalek: Well all this talk about how Marvel Studios is all about individual movies and not the global movie market.
-----
ManaByte: The fact that Disney doesn't own the distribution rights in the MCU is sad.
-----
UnpopularBlargh: I'm curious how this will turn out. I doubt Infinity War's success translates to other films.
-----
Punjabi_Hitman: Shocked and surprised I’ve seen this movie.
-----
Dalek: That's what my sister thought when she saw it.
-----
jelly: I'm surprised it's not a huge success.

-----
Bork: I use the internet, but I don't think it's a good use of time. If I completely write something, I don't get it. The internet is a great tool for that, I can get all sorts of things out of it.
-----
FUME5: Your question is not so pressing.
-----
Hickbilly: It's pretty much a dead-end job with no real ups being put on it, but depending on where you live it might be possible.
-----
BDS: I'm 28 and I read everything I can from the internet all the time.
-----
Elynn: I read everything.
-----
Aurongel: I'm not sure you're asking, but I study for A-Level and I have to take A-Level because I have to write about games I don't want to get to in order for it to be easy to study for others.
-----
Shiloh: I don't think it's a good use of time. If I have to take a class, I wouldn't take it. If I had to take a test, I would take it. If I had to take a work test, I would take it. If I had to take a class, I would take it. I would never fail a D's test, I would always fail a W's test.
-----
CrazyIvan1978: You don’t have to write everything. I often write not everything and also not something very complex but I don’t write a lot. I wish I had a computer to learn more about internet stuff, but I don’t do it. I do prefer studying on my phone.
-----
Li Kao: I use the internet, but I dont read all of it. I also don't read much else, other than maybe the occasional recommendation somewhere online.

Zulith: So far it has been confirmed that Angel will be Angel, but there are people who believe it's confirmed that he's a witch, which will be explained in the script.
Angel being a vampire in the comics is also setting up a death in the series, but it's been kept under wraps for a while.

ZeroX: Why not just make it canon?

Dale Copper: Oh shit.

ILikeFeet: Angel was never a vampire

Everyone over here in the US has to get the exact same citizenship every time.

~!~Democrats to propose massive tax cuts for the rich, boosting defense spending

Tracygill: This is a continuation of the "war on churches" rhetoric that has been getting worse over the past decade with increasing efficiency at tax and spend on government.
-----
Noroi: It's a good thing to do, I'd argue.
The US is already doing well.
-----
Phrozenflame500: I'm not sure the GOP's position is worth supporting. Defense spending won't magically solve our unaffordable high paying jobs.
-----
Bandage: Republicans already hate church and will never give them a pass.
-----
Arrakis: Only way would trump propose to fix them
-----
cwmartin: The first option will always be an absolutely terrible idea.
I'm one of those Republicans who thinks the great retreat to the bottom of the pool and then to the top of it all will be a great idea.
-----
Volimar: The GOP's position is that churches need to be reevaluated. The more conservative churches would be taxed and they wouldn't have to be held accountable to the government.
Trump: "What about the churches?"
-----
Volimar: They're churches. They're trying to hide their lies.
-----
Titik: I believe it's this:

~!~My boss is a jerk [Mod edit: real talk reply]

whitehawk: I’ve been working at a company for about a year now, and my boss has gotten really annoying with comments and nasty comments. I’ve been having some issues, but we’ve already moved on to talking about technology and the internet.
One of the most recent examples was when our CEO of choice was talking about the new ads on YouTube. He was talking about how we were using them to use the data we were mining to make some new videos. He was like, “it’s not a video, they’re just following the marketing. I’m explaining this to you. I’m wanting recommendations on new games I want to see. I’m not telling you to be tell me these are the ads that are coming your way.” My boss is a jerk, because I’ve been telling him this since January. He’s really just a YouTube dad.
Anyways, he’s pretty shitty. As a former boss I can see how he’s starting to get really shitty. I don’t know how much of a company he runs, but he’s also self-funding his company, so his behavior is pretty much like a boss on the run. He’s always been a jerk.
-----
BlackGoku03: He is a jerk because he's a YouTube dad. 
He's the first person I ever told for a position I never got. 
I never got a manager. 
I'm now trying to get a job at a small staffing agency.
-----
whitehawk: I was doing an interview for a part time position at a tech company, but got hit with a complaint (from a friend) about some of the "content" they were trying to squeeze. I feel like they're trying to take too much control away from themselves, but I guess they don't know how to handle content that doesn't fit with their mission.
-----
subpar spatula: I get the job. I'm not.

TheGamingNewsGuy: What are the best Power Rangers Anime of all time and why?
-----
Ashby: I like the one where Megatron is voiced by John Boyega.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I don't know why they decided to make it so long without any actual credit card backing to make the movie even more expensive so they can't properly credit the movie
-----
Ashby: I guess I like the one where Megatron is voiced by John Boyega.
-----
SageShinigami: I liked it as a kid. The first two fights were great. The second was boring as hell.
The third had a bit of a generic feel to it.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think John Boyega is the best one
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Its tough because I think the voices of both Boyega and Villeneuve made it good.
-----
SageShinigami: I liked it more than the first. I think it made up for it not having the best fight scenes.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I think John Boyega is voiced by Guy DeVito

Cocolina: I love her in this role, but I think they can't make her as "natural" as she is in the comics. Her performances in the comics don't always translate to the live-action medium.

Jiraiya: I like her so much in the comics. I hope she goes back to making a wack movie.
-----
Vonocourt: I watched this in the theater at work and I was wondering why she was in that movie...and it was funny.
I wish I could say she is a natural, even though I know she isn't.
I hope she goes back to making movies, just that she is a natural person.

BAD: I'm not a good interviewer, I don't get sales people, I don't get great technical people, and I don't get the kinds of people I'd want to be in my shoes.
I'm in a big city, and I'm not the most intelligent, but I do have better taste than most people I work with. I work with a lot of different people, and sometimes I get great interviews.
I was talking to a man who works in an industry where we have to do a lot of development, development that is really a learning experience, and sometimes we have to do that development for the first time. He had worked in different companies and had to learn a lot of things, but he said he was really good at a lot of things, and would be good for another job.
I was like, "I don't know, I don't understand how this works." And then I left.
-----

Tron1: Good interview tips.

-----
Cells Interlinked: I was a very bad interviewer, constantly trying to get the right questions, my main weaknesses made me almost always bad at guessing stuff. I even got unprofessionally good at questions that I had little experience with.
Next time I was interviewed I had to explain my name and explain that I was a game designer for a gaming studio

~!~Why was it not cancelled on Netflix?

Deleted member 1258: I saw it was getting so popular I decided to give it a shot. For some reason, it was not being received well. It's was not very good. The movie was not very good, and was laugh out loud funny. It was also out of the city at the time, and had some dumb jokes throughout.
I was pretty sure it was a low priority, and that I was probably being recorded for a season.
I'm pretty sure I saw it in the theaters, and I got it on DVD but never watched it.
Why was it not cancelled?
-----
TheBeardedOne: Probably because it was either not received as well as it deserved or it was not as funny as it should have been.
I doubt it had a great ending, either, but it was funny enough to warrant a season 2.
-----
Vonocourt: It was certainly funny and had a ton of laughs. 
Did watch the Netflix Marvel movie a few years back, it was probably a lot of the same fun that I remember from the one in the US.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Thought it was well done, but maybe I should have probed more.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I think it was a given it was going to get so much better.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Maybe I just didn't get it as well. It definitely was funny, and was a lot of the same fun that I remember from the one in the US.
-----
Gwenpoolshark: I was pleasantly surprised by the movie too. It was quite funny.
-----
Deleted member 1258: Eh. I dunno, maybe it was somehow too different for me. It was a lot more kid-friendly than it expected to be and actually turned it around. I'm not sure I thought it would stick out enough to warrant a season 2.
-----
Deleted member 1258: Oh, I just watched it one day before going to bed and was surprised to find out the kid was in it.
-----
Jims: Yeah. I really enjoyed it. My girlfriend had a similar experience with it when we got back from the US.
Was fun to watch some funny scenes.

~!~What is the best/most memorable music in your language?

fireflame: When I am alone, in a different country, or in another country, or in another country, or in another country, I always sing in a foreign language. Sometimes I sing for a very long time, often for weeks, sometimes months, but my language is so varied that I often forget to sing, even if I have the right intention.
I guess what I mean is, what is the best/most memorable music in your language? I am curious to hear what you think.

~!~How is it that someone I've KNOW for 35 years now is now the old person you probably looking for a hangout with is still around?

Dali: I was talking to a friend of mine on the phone this morning and she said that she's not with the Baltimore Sun anymore because she's "frozen dead." She's no longer with them and she's just going to move out of her shitty old hole. I mean, it's not like she was in Baltimore and she could have had a great time at Dyer's or whatever. She's not even, like, a bartender in NYC anymore. 
Her mom was an intern when she got in Baltimore when she was young and she's actually not the old woman anymore. She's not in Baltimore anymore, she's living in New York. She's not living in New York anymore. 
I'm just really interested in seeing how people react to this.
-----
I am a Bird: 50-50. I have a very strong association with and am very much invested in the local game fair circuit.
-----
Silfer: I've been around and know people that run around wherever they're going, I'm just a little surprised that I've never had a hangout with either. I'm always surprised when people come up with reasons why they'd be looking for a new hangout.
-----
Dali: I was once in a bar once, and a guy came up to me and asked me "What's wrong with your haircut?" and I said "It's the bar and it's the local game fair circuit. I'm just curious" and he laughed.
-----
shira: You're going to have to ask the bartender. What's your haircut budget?
-----
DGenerator: What kind of haircut are you getting?
-----
D i Z: I was just like a year old. I never liked going to the bar with the locals.
-----
Lord Azrael: I love Baltimore, but I am an outlier so I have no loyalty to either.
-----
Galleren: I live in GA and have not had a hangout with locals, I'm happy to keep the bar and the food.

Buckle: I am a decade younger and still a little envious that I can get a haircut with some specialties that people are 'old' on.

~!~Zack Snyder's "Man of Steel" thread

ZattMurdock: There's a thread already, but I thought it'd make good use of the other thread that already exists for other criticisms of the movie.
This thread is for doubting whether or not Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is the most accurate and definitive story of the MCU that we've seen since the Ultimate comics. It's also with a good deal of respect for its source material, which I am well aware I've seen multiple times.
So let's start with the general premise of this thread:
Man of Steel is such a disappointment. It's so muddled and poorly thought out. Snyder's take is inarguably my favorite superhero movie. It's so muddled and poorly thought out it's a legitimate disappointment. I'm not saying that the movie itself is the most accurate take; I'm merely expressing the sentiment that the movie is the least correct interpretation of its source material.
I think it's a decent movie even at basic aspects, even if I don't think it's the most accurate take. It's something. It's telling. It's spectacular.
I'm not saying that the movie is better than the Ultimate comics, especially when DC's take on the superhero genre didn't make it past the first two films, but I'm just saying that the movie is spectacular in its own right.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: OP, show your appreciation by posting a pic of the Garden of Words. It's a great pic.
-----
Volimar: I'm not sure about that. I think it's pretty good.
-----
ZattMurdock: The picture above is from the comic book thread. I'm not saying that it is the best comic, nor am I saying that it isn't good, but I think a lot of this can be re-created.
-----
Geist: It's great. Snyder's setting is great. Snyder's setting is great.
I think that's a great thing to say to any comic fans out there.

Grunge_Hamster: NO!

~!~The Last Jedi - Give Your Favorite Anime/Movie Saberments!

sqwarlock: Okay, so I've finally started watching the series, and I'm enjoying the last few episodes. The plot is interesting, visually impressive, and it has a great cast (and I'm a sucker for every Guardian in any Jedi/Jedi trope). I really enjoyed the first few episodes, but nothing has really clicked in the last several seasons.
I've watched the last few seasons, and it's a slow, but steadily increasing pace. The first season is a slog, but it's still engaging. The second and third seasons are great, but I'm now watching them all in chronological order and I like the order more. The GoT seasons are a bit more difficult, but still an enjoyable watch for those lapsed-we-don't-exist fans.
What are your favorite Saberments?
-----
weirder: I think I like the one from the OT.
-----
Speely: The one from the OT is my favorite.
-----
sqwarlock: About halfway through, and I like it.
I'm not a fan of the idea of a Jedi appearing in a Star Wars story because it's usually just a bunch of Khan loyalist characters, and the Jedi being able to defeat the Khan was a huge letdown. I think I'm in the minority here, though.
-----
GuitarGuruu: Honestly the show is ok, it's just the plot that is messy and the cast is awful, but it's characters like Maul and Maul's father Jake who aren't as good as the bad guys.
-----
Corran Horn: Haven't watched the last few seasons but I wish it was better.
-----
Enduin: I thought the first season was fantastic and I liked it more than the sequels. It's a shame the series is pretty short so it's hard to judge everything after a year.
-----
sibarraz: What does it mean?
-----
Speely: I understand that it's a slog, but I still like the first season. I think it's the most entertaining Star Wars show of the past decade. And the fights are intense, even if they are some weak ones.
-----
sibarraz: Also "I am a Jedi"
The plot is generic, and the cast is average.

~!~You ever read something you're very proud of?

BAD: I'm pretty proud of my wife. She helps countless people with cancer. She's a model. She's beautiful. She has a wonderful personality.
I usually say things like "I read the thread title wrong. I read it wrong, I read it wrong, I read it wrong."
But this week, I read something that really stood out to me.
I'm an environmental consultant working on a major paper about environmental issues.
She's a good person, but she's kinda cliche. Kind of like Matthew Matosis who is kinda arrogant and a bit controlling.
On the academic side of things, I read about Larry Nassar.
On the anti-vaxx bandwagon, I read about a study about him.
On the conservative side of the fence, I read something that I hated.
On my "own doing nothing", I read something that I really wanted to be curious about.
I'm not proud of it.
But I have.
What about you?
-----

There were many ups and downs of the war, but I was fascinated by the cold war and how the Cold War affected the world, and the impact of communism. Since I was a little kid, I have learned more about the cold war.
I was wondering how many historical figures from the Cold War would have an impact on the modern world, as well as the impact of capitalism.

~!~Halloween Filler

EvilChameleon: I started watching the first episode of F. Murphy's Halloween Horror 2 today and was immediately reminded of the Halloween variants in the thread title. For those uninitiated, they're basically similar, but with a lot of flair.
The Halloween variants are the same. The Halloween puns aren't as crazy, and the puns are a little less 'grounded, but likeable', in the way that the original Halloween movies did. I think this one is based on the first Halloween, but the original Halloween versions are pretty extreme.
The original Halloween versions are pretty much the same, since they're mostly just puns and the occasional pun. I think the kind of joke that was made for the original version a bit more is pure horror.
I'm not a fan of the puns of the original versions, but this one is pretty extreme.
So what are your favorite versions of F. Murphy's Halloween Horror 2?
-----
Jintor: I liked the original version and it does hit a little too hard
Comes with the hook I believe but that's about it
-----
Z-Beat: I don't remember any of the puns in the original, but the original Halloween version comes with the hook.
-----
CormoranStrike: I liked them.
-----
Mulciber: I liked the original version a lot more. The one that was a bit extreme is where I was initially watching. The one I was watching had like a really fun trick-or-treating moment that made me laugh.
-----
hateradio: The first one it's Halloween. The second one is Halloween-movie.
-----
itwasTuesday: I thought that the original version was a little too extreme.
-----
Griselbrand: I loved the original and liked that the trick-or-treating was more actual and the jokes were a little more tongue-in-cheek.
-----
julian: I liked the original version way more, but I loved the parody version.
-----
EvilChameleon: It's the one I've been waiting so long for. It's everything that the original had and more.

~!~How much do you spend on food?

entremet: I'm on a budget now and I feel like I'm going to need to lower. I'm definitely going to eat less, but I'm not buying chipotle chicken strips or whatever other food thing I'm supposed to eat with my meals. I don't eat too much junk food. I don't particularly eat fried foods anymore. I just buy a couple handful of organic foods and store them around the house in the kitchen.
I definitely do not eat junk food, which I haven't gotten used to. Just like I wouldn't normally buy fresh food, I'm not planning to make my house in the next year, so I'm not really set for junk food. I'm not going to try and eat garbage or make it myself.
I'm not necessarily going to eat garbage unless it's rice or potatoes or chicken. I'm just not really looking forward to potato softtakes which I used to make with my mom. It does make me feel better, but I still need to make soup or a curry that incorporate elements of both sides.
What about you?
-----
subpar spatula: I'm not a fan of junk food. I like healthier alternatives. I just don't eat all that much. I'm not a fan of the idea of junk food being expensive.
-----
Wackamole: I eat a lot, but I usually buy a really good food. I buy a couple of snacks a week. 
The only time I eat too much is when I'm having heavy feeling stomach pain. Sometimes I eat a couple of okra(healthy bread) and then have to go to the doctor for an ultrasound to check the acid build-up in my acid-susceptibility and blood tests.
-----
Wackamole: I'm not trying to be selfish, it's the same as eating whole lot of rice. For me, it's the first time in my life I've been in ketosis. It's a long slow slow transformation. It's a big relief, but you have to keep in mind that the usual ketone-lowering stuff is REALLY TURD-WHY! Like, the first couple of days, I was like "oh, I was just in ketosis mode," but then I got back into normalcy.

~!~The Simpsons has been cancelled

Dalek: I’ve been watching The Simpsons for a while and I’ve finally decided what the hell I want to do with it. I’ve seen it for years and have always loved it. However one week ago I started to watch season two and holy fuck this show has been consistently bad. It’s just ridiculous and it’s why I’m watching this show now.
Season two has been pretty divisive and the only thing that’s “good” is Bart leaving Springfield and having some lame dialogue in the Bart Mansion.
-----
Agar25: I just finished season one and yeah it was bad. I loved the episodes where Bart meets with Lisa and they just kept going like weirdly for like 5 minutes.
-----
Dalek: I’m not sure I can love this show without it.
-----
skeezx: i watched season one pretty much every other week and we were all lukewarm on it at best. i just saw season three and holy fuck its not bad. the writing is fucking atrocious and it's too bad the last season has filler in general. the last season was a little better but still not bad. season 3 had really good writing and art but the last one was just too much.

woodcutter: it's the clickbait one.

~!~Favorite Movie of 2018

whatsinaname: I'll admit, I had a tough year...
The Shape of Water!
Had a ton of great movies, but didn't make it to the big screen. I was also really disappointed with Call Me By Your Name, which I enjoyed seeing took a huge risk not involving myself in the right way.
The Disaster Artist also had a handful of amazing movies, but I really doubt I'll ever go see those again, even if they are good.
What are the movies that you guys were hyped for?
-----
carlsojo: The Shape of Water. I watched it this year and loved it.
-----
Kevtones: I'm not sure why, I thought Lawrence of Arabia was going to be the obvious choice but it got reviewed really well.
-----
Cipher Peon: I've always been a sucker for horror movies
My favorite genre, but not for the reasons you may think. I just watched The Hateful Eight the other day and it was pretty fun.
-----
Vincent Alexander: I've been waiting a long while for this one to come out. I've seen like 6 or 7 amazing movies this year.
-----
TheLetdown: Blade Runner.
I thought Lawrence of Arabia had a solid first half, then the rest was rough and boring. Then...it’s just Blade Runner.
End of. It.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Not the one that looks like a b----h.
-----
digitalrelic: A Quiet Place was great, but I just watched it the other day.
-----
CormoranStrike: Gotti
-----
Cybersai: I saw The Disaster Artist last year and it was a damn good movie.

~!~First teaser for "The Little Mermaid" movie

Daffy Duck: It's being produced by Lindsey Beer.
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: Disney is basically making a 3D movie for their streaming service
-----
Khanimus: I like the idea of Little Mermaid but... that's a first.
-----
Kuro: Fucking Lindsey Beer.
-----
Daffy Duck: I want to see the Little Mermaid in 3D.
-----
WhateverItTakes: That's cute.
-----
Kuro: I'd be a little sad if I were a Disney executive who didn't like Attack of the Clones.
-----
Pilgrimzero: Just in time for Blockers...
-----
Chaos2Frozen: I actually had a feeling it would be a Disney thing.
-----
Chae3001: Imagineering’s animation is pretty damn good, and I’m a fan of the Little Mermaid. 
Probably just have to name it Disney.

~!~Newsweek: FDA to outright ban ‘pungent’ unriaspored in food

WrenchNinja: 
-----
Eylos: There is no way to enforce this without the full on ignorance is just going to be legal anyway.
-----
Z-Beat: This is probably going to be a 16-hour day for the final decision
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Soap is banned from sale at grocery stores so that is all kicking and no smoking.
-----
M.Bluth: Didn't the FDA just outright ban flavored unriasposed foods two weeks ago?
Also, is there a market for this?
-----
dani_dc: FDA needs to outright ban vaping.
-----
Kukulcan: The FDA is marketing full flavored vaping kits. That is not true
-----
Luchashaq: So vaping is just a few weeks away.
-----
Dennis8K: FDA needs to actually ban unriasposed vaping.

TheAbsolution: I mean, I don't think this is going to be the final decision, but if it is, then I am not surprised.

~!~You know - do you really need to be told the things you are going to say to your mother?

John Doe: I had a discussion with my dad once about this topic and honestly I think I am going to say it to my mom and she's going to laugh it off and that's ok.
I have a girlfriend who is also a woman, but I'm not really sure how she feels about it. So, is it a sign of things to come?
-----
Fat4all: a fist bump or something
-----
Z-Beat: Not saying anything until I have a girlfriend, if she's not around.
-----
TheFireman: Have a few beers with the other person before moving out.
-----
Subpar Scrub: If I’m really going out with the GF next door, I’ll tell her about myself. I know it’s not always about me, but I’ll say something.
-----
Squarehard: No, that wouldn't be a good way to get her to meet other guys.
But if it's something she really wants to do, I'd just say "excuse me, mother".
-----
John Kowalski: I'm not sure what you mean by respecting her autonomy . . . but I don't think it's necessary.
-----
shnurgleton: I'm assuming you mean "if she's not around," not sure what that means
-----
Wackamole: No. Your girlfriend can be a girl too. But it's not a sign of anything to get her to date.
-----
Mulciber: No, I don't think it's necessary to date her around.
It's just a window to say no to a new relationship.

Skinny Pete: This is ridiculous.

Why would any national security adviser do this?

Broken Joystick: Who is Steele?

Imperfected: He's not part of the special counsel team that was called into question by the Steele dossier.

~!~The best Star Trek episode of all time?

Modest_Modsoul: I know I'm going to go with STO-43, but I have to go with ST4.
The sheer terror that is Patrick Stewart's performance is something I have only seen in its original format.
What other episodes are absolutely must-reads to anyone interested in Star Trek?
-----
vestan: ST4.
Give me that Picard.
-----
Elitist1945: I saw the first three episodes of Enterprise with my dad back in like 2003.
-----
SteveWinwood: all 3 are required reading for any Trek fan
-----
modest_esk: I think there's a lot of weird shit in the TNG universe, but some of the weird shit in TNG is just so ... fucking bizarre.
-----
The Living Tribunal: I think the first episode of TNG with Picard is one of the great ones. 
I have never seen a single episode of Enterprise.
-----
CopperPuppy: Just watch it
-----
NealMcCauley: The first (and probably last) episode of TNG.
-----
Dalek: I’ve never seen a single episode of Star Trek.
But Arthur Christmas is an insane sci-fi play and it’s on Netflix.
-----
Thordawgg: I was going to say the same thing but I think there's a couple of really good episodes of TNG out there

~!~The City of Oakland to Close Jan. 27, 2019

Landy828: The City of Oakland will close its Jan. 27, 2019 closing the Oakland Museum of Art to the public, following a landmarking decision.
The unanimous decision was made after a nearly three-week investigation by the Assistant Attorney in Charge of Art Mike Walla in March, where they began looking into the causes behind the closure.
"This is a very difficult time for the Art of Man. We've had a long history of investigating the causes of death of art critics and witnesses, including homicide, murder, abuse and neglect," Walla said. "Our mistake is giving proper attention to the circumstances of the cases."
The Magistrates Court was informed of the decision at 1:20 p.m. today.
-----
Landy828: Not the end of the world, Oakland.
-----
Bjones: I’m in Oakland to see my Mom get a new apartment.
-----
Landy828: They do admit to not being the best city for a lot of people, but I'm optimistic about the future.
-----
Landy828: Fucking Oakland.
-----
Casual: Wow, this would be a huge loss. I thought the closure was part of a larger gentrification problem, but no, the city lost its most popular place. It's not like all the new developments are going to be anywhere near as iconic as it is now.
-----
Landy828: I don't even know why I'm even here anymore.
That's crazy to me.
-----
Casual: You're not allowed to use public spaces. You're not allowed to drive. You're not allowed to work out in public. You're not allowed to take public transit.
-----
Landy828: This is a really sad situation.
I went to a birthday party in Oakland today and there was a birthday party for a jazz band.
-----
Landy828: I'm in Oakland to see my mom get a new apartment.

Slushimi: I have been out of the US for a while now, but I've finally decided to make some steamed vegetable soup for the wife. She wants to cook this in stir-fryer form, and I'll make it in the oven. At this point, what else am I supposed to do besides stir-frying? I've been doing stirfrying in the glass container that is in the fridge at work for the last few weeks, but it's been a while since I've done it. I just don't see the big deal. Maybe she'll like it? I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to cook, so I don't see the big deal? What else am I supposed to cook?
-----
Septimus Prime: Tuna/turkey?

BLEEN: Sautee/pork?

hydrophilic attack: if a thread is more than a day old, reset this

Pickman: Cook a roast.

phanphare: just make your own
there are so many options

John Rabbit: Cook some corn.

~!~What are some of your favorite "SJWs" & "Alt-Right" movements?

ImTheresaMay: My main point of contention will be with the "alt-right" & "alt-left" being individuals with a lot of "radical" viewpoints.
I've seen a few videos on Reddit and YouTube that have been a bit interesting, but I'm curious to see what Era thinks.
-----
sphagnum: The Alt-Right
The Alt Right
Alt Right Welfare Society
-----
SolicitorPirate: The Alt-Right, as an ideology, seems to be a big point of contention with the alt-right. I think it’s more a “right to exist” kind of way; the alt-right isn’t really about “right to work” but kind of about “right to be rich.”
-----
Jombie: Alt Right, as a concept. I can only think of using a picture of the person as an adjective, but I know that's not a good substitute for the person's history and their views.
-----
Volimar: The Alt Right came about from the alt-right, and it's probably the most right-leaning movement in human history.
-----
Conciliator: I don't think it's a right term, but I'd use that when describing the people. The Alt-right would be bigger than "Nazis are good," but I wouldn't call them Alt-Right.
-----
Mr. X: The Alt Right
-----
L Thammy: I think it's more the case that it's not a right term, and the alt-right are definitely not a right wing movement.
-----
BDS: The Alt-Right is not a right-leaning movement, but the alt-left is.
-----
The Almighty Tria: Alt-Right because it is a "discursive concept" that came about under the impetus of the current political climate, and because it is easier to make morally acceptable moral cases about certain ideologies than others.

~!~How are you dealing with the Trump administration’s reinstatement of James Comey?

PlayALLTheGames: For the past year or so the President of the United States has been firing a multitude of judges, appointed by his previous administration, from a bunch of institutions that were deemed too hard left to even be true free speech.
Among them are: 
Judges that had an effect in taking down Mueller, Trump’s Russia investigation and obstruction of justice. 
The most recent one has been 
On to FantasticMrJoe's tweets:
On the recent stroke of paper:
On the recent reinstatement of James Comey:
On the recent confirmation of Rod Rosenstein: 
So for how long has this debacle taken you?
Thoughts?
-----
Airing of Grievances: I'm not too sure if this is a new trend or just an old one. I'm a bit more reserved and reserved my opinions on Trump about the last two weeks than I was when Comey was nominated. I'm a bit of both these days and I think I'd be more than happy if I were still around if he was still in office. 
I'm not quite sure if I'd be more than happy if the things I feel are fair and just weren't good. I feel I wouldn't be happy with any of the things he's been through or how things are going.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'm just happy I'm not in prison.
-----

Dishwalla: I'm happy about the change in power. It was a good presidency, but the guy has basically hijacked the country for himself and it's mental state.
-----
Spenny: I'm just happy we are going to get a change again.
-----
The Albatross: I've been looking forward to this for a long time. The recent events have been extremely sobering, and for a period of time I've been really worried. I was worried because I was worried that he was going to nominate a class of people and people are going to be disqualified from a seat because of whatever stuff happened after.
But then I've been on this forum for almost a year and I just saw it go down an awful path. It's really depressing that something so important came back from such a long time and maybe I shouldn't be worried at all.

~!~How do you deal with a "tired of dealing with racism"?

Deleted member 21380: I've noticed myself increasingly being referred to as "niggers" and "hired thugs" when it comes to modern events, and I feel like I'm the target of a malicious marketing campaign to get me to vote.
The fact that my family, friends, family members etc all have to endure racial prejudice is depressing and disgusting.
I'll be honest, the way I deal with things is by and large, not by the fact that I've been in the position of office.
I'm tired of winning and I'm tired of being dumped, but I can't help but feel a bit of urgency is needed.
I'd prefer that the word has more of a positive connotation than a racial connotation, but at the same time, it's obviously a terrible word to possess in the current political climate.
-----
shnurgleton: I deal with racism by using it because I don't like it
-----
BuddyDharma: I'm not tired of racism. I'm tired of being snubbed, shamed, and ignored for enjoying a certain artistry.
-----
CormoranStrike: I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being snubbed and ignored.
-----
Dennis8K: "Don't be racist"

I'm tired of being snubbed and shamed.

Psychoward: Excited
-----
Slayven: I mean they could have easily started on Black Friday.

Randomly Generated: Not excited.

Slayven: Or they can have had a Black Friday thread to talk about Black People
-----
Rvaan: Man, DC is going to be out of ideas.

Psychoward: The "Let's Make it" bit is good because at least the "Let's make it" has a message.

Metallix87: I'm not excited for the "Protest's welcome" but I'll be there nonetheless in case people don't want to come.

~!~On this day 10 years ago, 20,000 Jewish Frankfurt Jews were murdered in a Jewish prison in Israel (The Guardian)

Jackpot: For context, the birthday of Samir Mezvakin, a 23-year-old Frankfurt Jew, was the day he died. A very tragic day.
-----
Ogodei: I was born in Israel but I lived in Israel for two years before I moved to Israel. I did not go to see Europe as such, but I did watch Die Hard on TV.
-----
The Albatross: Indeed. It was absolutely tragic, but not tragic enough to bring my mind to the murders committed by Israeli settlers.
-----
AlteredBeast: I mean, the whole point of a protest is that the government is out to run you and your money, the settlers don't see the government as anything but a collection of scumlords.
-----
Heshinsi: I don’t know why people feel the need to write this sort of stuff, in such a cold hearted country where the state of Israel remains toothless. It’s embarrassing.
-----
Reverse Giraffe: Oh hey, that's just anti-Semitism.
-----
Dennis8K: I can't imagine how this country would have done without the suffering of the German people.
-----
The Albatross: I didn't realise that that was how the title was. I just had a conversation with another person a while back who was referring to the deaths of the German people, and we riffed on it, and then we set about toying with the idea that there is no other way of gauging the reaction to the killing of the Jewish people in Israel.
Maybe I'm not very well versed in European politics, but I feel that the idea that there is no other way of gauging the reaction to the killing of the Jewish people in Israel is a farce.
-----
Dennis8K: Germany, I guess?
-----
Kirblar: Yeah, it was always the settlers who were terrorists.

~!~New Study: The Longest You've Been Seen With a Scenario In The Plot of a Movie, and What It Tells Us About It

Andrew Korenchkin: Evil and happy is the best summary for the plot of a movie.
I've been going through the same thing for years, so I've always had an open mind. It's only recently I've been able to have a conversation about movie plot because I've seen it all.
-----
vypek: I thought the X guys were the ones who was getting the most screen time?
I think they could be considered the most problematic ones though. No one is really robbed in this movie.
-----
CormoranStrike: That’s a good summary of the plot. I’d like to see more info about the guy from the article, I’m still trying to research it but I think it’s worth trying to see how the plot ties into the movie.
-----
TheLetdown: It’s easier to write off X as the most problematic than X being the most innocuous.
-----
Spoopy Boatington: I thought it was a nice paragraph about how you’re not supposed to take plays that seriously, and it’s informative.
I still think I can’t make friends if I don’t try. I don’t even know how to feel about that.
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I've been saying this for years. The plot is the worst.

Deleted member 15632: I think the plot is pretty straight-forward but it would be nice to have more info about the guy from the article.

~!~You are given a movie by a movie critic. What do you pick?

Deleted member 1258: I don't really have an answer, but I'm interested to hear some suggestions.
For my pick, I guess I'd prefer to see the movie early, and not later in the film.
For example, I really enjoyed The Lion King, and I can appreciate critics' points on how much the movie could have improved. However, I feel like The Lion King was robbed of having the level of craftsmanship that The Lion King had. The fact that the first 10 or so minutes of the movie are so pure and enjoyable to watch is a bummer.
What do you guys do when you're giving a movie a chance?
-----
Fat4all: it’s early in the fucking franchise so I guess I’ll just roll with it
-----
Medalion: The one time I'm not going to let an old friend be the last word, it's the one time I'll say to someone "You are hereby designated the last word in the history of the universe", and they'll say "Ok, that's cool!".

Deleted member 1258: I don't mind it if someone's review isn't my kind of shit, but I certainly don't want to be the last word.
-----

Skade: I don't want to be the last word.

Razgriz-Specter: I am the last word.

Kain-Nosgoth: I dont think it matters much, but if someone's review, if the movie is good, and is well written, then I won't watch it

~!~BBC to air a documentary about the experiences of black British students protesting in Durham

Audioboxer: Thought this was quite interesting. There's also a Facebook post from the council about the documentary.
-----
Xiaomi: That's an interesting story, I'm glad it's going to be told.
-----
Audioboxer: Apparently I was on the ground in Dumfries the other day and the BBC tv crew was using their phones to look over the students, I thought for example they were going to ask them to leave the building or to shoot them in the face.
-----
Audioboxer: The BBC tv crew did a thing.
I was on the ground in Dumfries the morning after the demonstration happened. The BBC tv crew was looking over the students, I asked them to leave the building and to drop the camera down to the students having the choice of being on the ground or not.
-----
Xiaomi: I saw two of them leave the building and I thought it was an awful joke, but there is something really satisfying about the experience of black British students being on the ground in Dumfries the morning after the demonstration in support of the students' right to freedom of speech. I felt incredibly lucky to have lived in the city, I think the students who took to the streets of London almost paid the difference between living in the far suburbs or living in the council estates.
-----
Audioboxer: I thought I was going to hate the documentary by a longshot that this was the first thing in a thread about the documentary. Disappointing.
-----
Koukalaka: Good luck.
-----
Audioboxer: That's what I thought too, but not what I wanted.
-----
djplaeskool: Good luck to the students who took to the streets over this documentary, and have now lost custody of their daughters.
-----
Django.Mango: Those students must have been on their phones!

~!~Why is there so much disdain for "respectable" tattoos

Platy: Most people that I know that have tattoos say that "look nice", but I guess its because the people that do them tend to be pretty nasty and nasty. Some will go against the tattoo then just cause it's a better look then the better looking one.
But most ppl will just shrug it off because they know that it's a good look and thats all that it takes.
So what is the purpose of having nice patties? 
Why is it so hard to get people to get rid of them?
-----
BDS: Tattoos are a good thing.
-----
Cyanity: Because people want to look good and are generally trash looking.
-----
sphagnum: Tattoos are everywhere.
Look at all the photos of people that have ripped them off.
-----
JaeCryo: Maybe it's a good look?
-----
Deleted member 1258: Because they're good, even if it's just for a one-hit wonder
-----
gutter_trash: because people who do them better don't have to actually wear them
-----
Platy: I think people who use them for a more "look cool" type of thing is something I take really, I think it is easier to accept.
-----
Travo: How does that make people uncomfortable?
-----
Cyanity: Well I mean - it's pretty easy to do. People who do it don't have to look like that. 
It's just hard.

~!~My parents are going to be on welfare...

DJwest: My parents are going on welfare and my stepdad passed away. I'm in a bit of a tough situation relative to the rest of the family, but I'm feeling pretty much alone in my own troubles. I have a long commute home with my wife, three kids and a dog, and it's been rough.
How do I get out of this? I'm 20 years old, live alone in a pretty depressing setting, chances are quite a bit of this is due to social services and housing, but if I'm reading it right I have a good outlook for a good life.
-----
hjort: Sounds like you've had your shit together, and have some sympathy if those around you are being fucked. I'm also 23 and have had some pretty bad experiences with the state of the UK in the past few years. I'm still living with my parents in a small town right by the sea.
They are, of course, Salvation Army.
-----
DJwest: Good to hear, I'll probably do something similar this year. Also it'll be a bit of a change for my parents. I'll probably keep my job, but until then I suppose I'll just be spending time with my family. I do feel bad though, because there's nothing I can do other than what I'm going through.
-----
Hank Hill: It'll be hard for them to not kick you out and make you feel guilty. You're never going to be able to afford them food or help to make the day.
-----
Starlight Glimmer: I don’t think I’ve given them money but I did have money when I was homeless and they were able to do what they do. I’d be even more down with other people if I were them.
-----
DJwest: I've had a similar experience with the Salvation Army, they were always really nice and they would let me borrow a jacket, any mexican here they are always nice to help me out.

shnurgleton: Keep your shit to yourself, it's not worth it.

====================
~!~Is The Last Jedi worth watching?

The perfect Dark Lord: The trilogy has been extremely influential and I was curious to know if the trilogy has been well regarded. To this I've also noticed that the film seems to be a great overall product and I would say it is worth watching. However I've also noticed a few issues.
1. There's a lot of density to the plot and the story seems to flow naturally. There's no need to make Star Wars feel like one movie.
2. There's no true story. There's a lot of Star Wars spin-offs which are not needed and they are rarely necessary to the overall story.
3. There's a lot of talking animals. A lot of Star Wars.
4. There's a lack of enough characters. Anakin was never the protagonist even if he was important.
5. The lame prequel prequel prequel prequel stuff is laughable in a galaxy far far far more than the Empire.
6. The plot feels stupid and there's no desire to root for it. It's a good movie but it's not a masterpiece.
7. The music isn't good either.
8. The dialogue is dumb.
The Last Jedi is a great movie and I love it but I feel like the overall narratives are a lot more shallow than the movies.
Personally I'd say it's worth watching. There's just not a lot of room to grow. But I'm curious what people think of it.
-----
Fantastapotamus: I can't say I've been in a similar situation, I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but I have seen it a few times. It's a great movie but I feel like it's a slog that mostly boggers on plot, characters, and bad acting from bad actors.
-----
Rackham: I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but the dialogue is good. The Last Jedi is a great movie but it feels like a lot of the same shit that happens in Star Wars. I think it's a good case study of the pitfalls of movies.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I watched the trilogy way back when, but I don't remember much. Maybe I missed some, but I didn't really care for them.
I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid, but I do remember it being fun.
-----

====================
~!~Why do so many people keep doing this stupid shit?

DukeBlue: It's a problem in tv, in movies and in the movies I must admit. It's like these people are losing their minds.
I have seen the "just go for a ride" while watching a movie and I've seen the "just go for a ride and get a sandwich" idiots.
I can see how they are able to read "idea X" or "idea X and get a sandwich" as some kind of edgelord and somehow they keep doing it. 
How is it that many of these people are just not even thinking about it? It's like they don't even like the fact that life sometimes can make them dislike something.
-----
Conciliator: it's just what we do
-----
TheBeardedOne: I think those people are just plain dumb. That's the only time I've seen it.
-----
Jintor: It's a common thing in politics, it's not a particularly new thing. When it first happens, it's because you're dumb, and thus weak.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I mean, you're not. I've been drunk before I saw it and had a bad time.

ItIsOkBro: I don't see it as a sign of weakness, but I do see it as a sign of strength.

Birdseye: Do you have a saying that describes all democrats?

-----
Cruxist: The whole "you're not weak" thing is so dumb that it's actually a good sign of strength. I don't see it as weakness to be honest, but strength for a failure.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: OP you’re not weak because you’re not strong enough. You’re weak because you’re not smart. 
I’m not saying that OP is dumb but I’m saying that OP is not weak because he’s not strong enough.

~!~Randomly selected "In a position of honor" thread

jett: I just randomly checked out this random "in a position of honor" thread, and I'm pretty blown away by it. I don't think anyone has ever thought of the concept of "in a position of honor" so I thought I'd share it.
I find myself on the opposite end of the crowd, and this feels like a big "I'm not here to discuss anything!" moment. I don't know what the best way to get started is, and I'm not going to lie that I don't know if I'm going to watch or not. I'm just kinda overwhelmed right now by the sheer amount of stuff I'm going to read, and I'm going to try to read as much as I can.
My intent is to figure out what this thread will be about, and what my feelings towards it are. 
I'm going to wait for a few days to see which is my first response.
I'm going to edit this thread so that it isn't just ten-20 responses, but at least once a day.

Airegin: The Dem establishment can't see irony in all of this.
-----
marrec: I think what's really happening is this is like the first time the Democrats have been in power for 40 years now, and they've been the opposition of virtually everything the past couple of decades.
And they'd rather just leave the Senate, the house, and the house than actually have someone competent to do their job. Which is to say, if Democrats were to win the midterms, they'd be in a position to stall the ACA for now, just as if they were willing to go to war to get the ACA through.
-----
WedgeX: I wouldn’t say that Dems are doomed, just that it’s not quite as obvious as they think.
-----
marrec: I’m not saying they are, but the recent election has been interesting for political reasons, but not as obvious as they think.

How is it that more don't want to go through the pain of having to live paycheck to paycheck with absolutely no job prospects, and even if they do, don't get paid a living wage, and can't afford to live below the poverty line and are stuck in a system that gives them a pass?

~!~LttP: The Sopranos

SolVanderlyn: I was just thinking about this show for some reason. I think it looks like it's inspired by some shows that were animated before it.
I've watched the first few episodes of it and I liked it a lot. The characters are well written and I thought some of the writing was clever, and I did get some aspects of the show that I hadn't really seen before. And I loved the characters.
Some plot points I'm pretty sure:
-The cast is pretty atrocious when compared to all the others in the same role.
-The show's characters are all stupid and terrible.
-The show's plot is convoluted at times
-The show's episodes are just poorly written
I enjoyed just about every second of the show. It's not the best show on earth, but I thought it was pretty good.
I wonder if there is a 4th season? I feel like I've seen through 10 of them, but they are like a decade old at this point.
The show had some really good moments. Marlon has a problem with the show's setting and I find it a real treat all the same. There are a few other issues I'm sure, but I'm glad I stuck around and didn't continue the series.

Cipherr: The only good part of this show.
The show is bad af as far as I know. But I still enjoyed it for what it was. Enjoyed what it was and what it added.

Mona: I think it was a pretty good show, but I wasnt all that hyped on season 3
Theres a ton of different aspects to the show
-The Marlon family dynamic
-The way the writing got twisted
-The way the story was animated
I don't think there was ever a point where it was just "okay," but I think they could have made it a little better.
-Marlon's character development

~!~My friend wants me to pay for a new mattress

janusff: So we have a few friends that are in their late 20’s and want a bed for their room. We’ve already paid for a room that we can sleep in for like $500. We have a ton of space for the bed that we can’t afford to buy so we’re thinking about buying a mattress.
Anyways, my friend wants to sell me a bed for a couple of bucks and I want to buy a mattress specifically. He’s generally pretty happy with the price but he already thinks it’s a rip off. He wants the smallest screen possible which I don’t mind. He wants the cheapest screen we could get for it.
Anyways, I’m wondering if anyone here is able to help me out with this. I’m on my laptop and they’ve both written scripts to their laptops to ensure that we don’t end up with a screen that might be too small.
He bought this one for $400.00 which is just below the minimum I’d need. I’d be okay with the screen size, but I don’t want a screen for it. I don’t want to buy something that is too small. I don’t have a large screen because I don’t want it to be an issue with my computer screen. I think I’ll just pay as much for it as what he’s paying for and forget about it. Anyways, anyone have any experience with this?

Septimus Prime: Call your local Best Buy or Samus.

It is 10 episodes each (each)
I won't spoil it, its hilarious and very sad.
Some of the stuff in the series can be quite relatable.
Some of the more severe moments in the series can be seen being so competitively trying to fit half a bottles of punch into a small space.

~!~Sophie Turner on Netflix's 'Sonic the Hedgehog'

UnpopularBlargh: Via TheWrap:
Sonic the Hedgehog is a great show. I can't say it's inspiring some brilliant lessons in bioterrorism because it's hardly 'The Wire' level dumb. However, I can't help but wonder if this is just her trying to find more audience for the show. She has no idea what self-censoring is or if she's just full of bullshit to keep it consistent.
I think her best bet is to base her show around the lessons she has learned regarding diversity in tech and the importance of ally and ally relationships.
-----
Neptonic: I'm all for it
-----
Dekim: I love the show. It's not about being a gamer or a nerd. It's about being an author, a screenwriter, a director, and a stage actor. She can write books, play musicals, make films. All of these people are incredibly valuable and have large audiences.

I was kinda surprised at how much violence was shown. I still think that's not the point, but it's an interesting idea.
-----
SageShinigami: Yeah I remember seeing this in the theater when I was a kid. Saw it in theaters too. It's really fucked up.
-----
Nappuccino: I didn't feel that bad, since I thought it was a little light on gore, but the violence was fairly uncomfortable.
-----
DJGolfClap: I'd definitely watch this again. I've seen all of the earlier films, and it's just so violent. 
Also, this was a bit like The Wizard of Oz with the Wendigo storyline. It's a movie about an older version of the Child of God, who is evil. They go around murdering people and taking everything that is in their possession, and the movie is supposed to be scary, but the plot isn't exactly what I'd want.
-----
Aselith: I've seen it multiple times, and I'd say it's the most violent film I've seen.
-----
Khanimus: I feel like I'm missing something. The violence is so pretty, but it's still just... shit.
-----
Wag: I remember a friend who watched this repeatedly. I think it was the first film I watched.
-----
Brian McDoogle: Just like the Wizard of Oz, I don't know about this movie. It was highly violent, but it was a great film, it's just bad.
-----
yuoke: There was a lot of blood and screams throughout the film.
-----
HStallion: It was a solid movie. I just wish it wasn't up to Patrick Wilson.

~!~What are some helpful resources for starting a business?

Agent Icebeezy: I've been trying to get in on the business side of things and have a few ideas:
A) I would like to start a business consulting for a small store I want to build as a casual/grocery store
B) I want to put my time into creating features for the website
A) What's a good tutorial for creating features for a website?
C) What's a good way to get into web development?
B) What's a good way to learn PHP?
C) What are some good websites that will be useful as a starting point?
I'm thinking of a number of more basic ones that I could look at and see if I like.
-----
molnizzle: What's a website?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: A fantastic resource.
-----
EvoTech: This.
-----
Doom_Bringer: here you go
-----
turbobrick: I think you could start one using BackyardJS, that is a frontend framework I think. I'd also suggest Node.js.
-----
staedtler: I would start with a basic tutorial on how to develop websites with web development in mind.
-----
Dekuman: I like learning things through games.
-----
The Albatross: I've been working on my business side of things for about a decade, so I think I've been doing a lot of things right, but I don't know how to make them all work. I want to start with a basic "starter" to build something beyond a basic basic basics.

~!~A friend of mine got an Apple Watch Face Camera.

Bufbaf: I love the face camera, I'm not a smart guy, but I think I'm crazy for buying a camera when I'm in the states.
It's a pretty nifty looking phone. Very nice hardware. $70 at the store, and I'm thinking its on sale for $180.
I'm curious as to how much it would cost for a regular phone (and I honestly don't care), but would someone here recommend it to me?
-----
Gorgamel: I got a Nokia 7 Plus for $220 a couple years ago for $820. That was a fun phone, but it was a pretty poor phone overall. I just wish it had an app that would track steps and the like so the camera was always a big factor.
-----
Bufbaf: I just wish that it had a phone sharing feature and not just a bunch of random people posting photos on a random forum. That's not what I'm looking for at all, but it's nice to have some additional privacy.

~!~What is the best way to watch Star Wars OT era movies?

AuthenticM: I'm currently watching The Clone Wars, and I absolutely love it. It gives a real sense of progression to the story, while being very easy to digest. It's also fun watching all the different ways, from the TV to Blu-ray, to watch in 4K HDR. It's a lot of fun. But, it's not for everybody. Those that do, do you have any favorite versions of the movies? Or, do you have any non-official versions? Or, any must watch additions?
-----
sphagnum: UHD remaster
-----
ManaByte: UHD remaster
-----
Einchy: UHD remaster 
The only real advantage this gives is that it doesn't need to be re-sanitized. Just a few extra frames.
-----
Replicant: One and done.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I just remapped all 7 Star Wars movies by Handreb scrubbing the old unedited ones. The 6 regular red background looks very nice and the new ones look way more pleasing. It's not particularly difficult to rewatch them in 4K HDR.
-----
Fat4all: remaster
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I'd prefer hand rebooting the first two (I know some old Jedi shit) but I suppose you could do it in the edit sequence that way if you just wanted to. I don't really mind the color grading either, just seems to make things flow better.
-----
Einchy: I have a 4K blu-ray of Thrawn that's being worked on.
-----
itwasTuesday: Old re-sanitized version now

Skai: I just got a "Happy Black History Month" PSA.
(I'm a young black male, and I don't think I've actually lived this year as much as I've been)
The first part of that PSA is "We WANNA BE BACK TO THE STUDIOS!"
I love this song.
-----
Thorn: If I wasn't so serious, I'd be taking that bus home.
-----
Thisman: This shit is so stupid and I think it is even more stupid that the president has to pay for the delay
-----
HStallion: I guess the shutdown will be blamed on the tax bill
-----
Thorn: I guess! It's not like they have a huge surplus to hire people to help?
Or at least I don't know if there's any federal workers who need the assistance they are getting.
I'll bet it doesn't mean much if someone can pay off the student loan debt of a potential mortgage payment.
-----
Pockets: You can’t blame Obama for this.

Ithil: No.

MIMIC: I mean, you can blame the president for anything.

~!~"Godzilla" villain would be the biggest fight in film history

JaeCryo: With the upcoming release of Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters, the question is, what would be the biggest fight in film history? The answer, of course, is probably Dragonball Z. But what about the next big "Boss" of Godzilla?
I'm talking about characters that were introduced in TV series or movies, Evolution, the movies that were all made after the original Godzilla, and they never got much better (with how little we got to see the end of the series), or more "extreme" than the Human protagonist, such as Fish Fishman. But what about the next big threat? Could it be Goku? Or a villain from a TV series? Or a book? Or a comic book?
In an old TV series, Fishman would have defeated the main villain from the Y2J manga and introduced his own version of a human? But who could defeat Goku in an even more brutal fight? Would you rather...
Or...
Or see more obscure characters like Noe Tuvan, Waititi and the One Above All. Or more obscure characters like the Janemba Spider-Man.
Who do you think would defeat Goku in an even more brutal fight?
-----
Fulminator: Goku going on a murder spree is the biggest fight in movie history imo
-----
Wollan: Goku could just vaporwave away to earth and take over the world.
-----
Khanimus: The end of the manga or the series?
-----
Gonzalez: I want to see a version of this made up.
-----
Khanimus: I mean, he's not really a villain, he's just a series of unfortunate events that lead nowhere.
There are not too many bad Goku stories.
-----

Sibersk Esto: Goku could destroy a huge portion of the universe.
-----

Wollan: I'd hope so, he's a villain in the sense that the original King is still alive and wants to destroy the Earth.
-----

====================
~!~Are we destroying the world in one direction or another?

Lant_War: It's been a rough day for me and my wife, especially after watching the trailer for this.
It's just hard to re-watch them, but we watched 3 of the movies and it's sort of impossible to know which is which, but in my opinion, it's not really the case at all.
-----
CaviarMeths: The first one is a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece of acting and directing.
-----
StopMakingSense: The first one is the best.
-----
Cocolina: Yes

shnurgleton: It's edited together, yes

~!~I recently lost a car

flyinj: I've lost my 21yr old Acura GTS VINTSON. Just a few days ago I was driving to work and it caught my ear. I was listening to an audio book on the radio and it sounded like a GTS to me.
The car was a Camry, my sister had one, my mom had one, my sister had one, my brother had one. I wasn't home, I was driving, I didn't even get home that night. I rocked my head and cried for a bit, then woke up and I was gone.
Today, I started to cry, I lost my job today, I had to give my nails a haircut, I lost a job today, I lost my best friend yesterday. I was trying to sleep the whole night before I fell asleep and I woke up my wife but I turned on the light to go to the window for some reason and I saw my husband's window open.
I just wanted to share, I've always hated this particular window in my life, I have never had a light that I could call my own color and that was a pretty dark color. I don't know why I did it but I was trying to sleep but I couldn't get up. I don't know what it is, I've never seen a light I could use that looked this bright.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: You can't cry like that.
-----
Duke Of Prunes: I've had this window a few times before. It's honestly a pretty sweet, eerie red.
-----
Veliladon: I lost a few things recently. One summer I was camping in Canada and when I was leaving I was driving through a storm drain and saw a red light coming out of nowhere. I looked up and saw a woman walking down the road and she was a bit bent over. She was wearing a shirt that is off. She got out of the car and looked at me like I was herunk. I was like "what? I thought you were dead." I was like "uh...hell." I was like "what?" She looked at me for like an hour. Then she got off.
-----
incognito: Did you get a notice that you have to be at work? If not then it's probably a good sign that you're driving.

Holy shit, this is a fucking bizarre experience:
Prior to this video, I thought that I had never seen something so bizarre in my life. I'm pretty sure I saw this in 2014, but I'm pretty sure I'm thinking of 2014 now.

Wulfric: I saw this on PornHub. It was a great video.

Wulfric: No, it's about how a pornstar acts while in a relationship.
They don't actually see each others bodies.
-----
D65: Yes

Wulfric: I had been thinking about that, but I'm still too afraid to even look at the video.

Sgt. Demblant: ...

I mean, guess what, Albatross?
-----
shira: I do like a "Albatross"
It's a thing

Sgt. Demblant: It's a Gray Matter thing. In the comics, the Albatross is a dark side graphing a DC plot and the incarnation of the DC Cinematic Universe.
It's like the Speed Demon of DC.
I'm not even saying this is real. I just want to know what other DC characters out there are.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: Yeeeah, I can totally understand if you would like to learn more about the Albatross.
It's a device used to make DC characters look like they actually are.

~!~What is your favorite song from The Magic Order?

Squarehard: From the songs that appear in the series, to the songs themselves, to their overall meaning, they are generally great.
I'll just start with my answer.
I'm sure there are many, but as for your personal choice, I'll just say:
The Black Knight - The Black Knight is a song from the Magic Order, which is the order in which the characters and their situations come to mind for this song. The two parts rhyme quite a bit, with the third part being a more melodic version of the opening song.
The Black Knight - The Black Knight is the third-most successful live album in the world, and the most successful pop record under the title Magic Order.
The Black Knight - The Black Knight is a trio of live albums, and of course, also one of the most popular.
There are numerous examples of the Magic Order rhyming with other songs from the series, such as songs like "The Dawn of a New Age" or "The Last Day of Magic", but as far as I can tell, only one of these songs actually rhymes with the name of the song.
The Black Knight - The Black Knight is a three-or-more-hugged album, made all the way up to the point where there is a section where the song starts rhyming with "Black Knight" as an example of which songs rhyme with the name of the song.
The Black Knight - The Black Knight is a three-or-four-part album, made all the way up to the point where there is a section where the song starts rhyming with "Black Knight" as an example of which songs rhyme with the name of the song.
So, which is your favorite?
-----
CrazyIvan1978: The Black Knight is the most melodic version of the Black Knight. The focus on the songwriting here completely changes how it all links together. It is a great example of the kinds of songs that are really easy to get into and easy to listen to.
-----
Mezentine: The one where there's a word that starts with "row" being the name of the three squares in the center of the song. You're in for a treat
-----
BAD: My favorite thing from the album is "The Last Day of Magic" which has a really good breakdown of

~!~I can’t stand the 4chan anime material surrounding Naruto and Bleach

John Doe: The first two seasons of Naruto are available on Netflix for free. The Bleach has a free season option, but it’s a pretty damn good show. The first season is even a 45 min episode and it’s more like a 24 minute episode, easily the best adaptation of the series. And if you don’t watch the show, you’re missing out on something totally amazing. Plus the show is free.
The first season is the best adaptation by far of the Boruto series. The show is great, it’s wildly entertaining, it’s a perfect mix of old school and new high school travesties.
So I’m asking you Era... can you please tell me that the Boruto anime is amazing? It doesn’t even seem like it has yet to finish it.
-----
Karateka: Naruto is good, it's just that it's far too long and lacks a lot of the most basic plot ideas from other anime's.
-----
JadedWriter: Why are you posting this tbh?
It's amazing. It's not even good, and it's not even funny.
-----
PeakPointMatrix: I'm not sure why you'd want to make threads that merely consist of "Boruto has some really good OP material surrounding Naruto and Bleach", but maybe you just don't want to make them click?
-----
WrenchNinja: No, you're right. This is just bad writing.
-----
SageShinigami: The first season is largely mediocre. It's a funny, funny show devoid of any real depth. 
But I don't know why you'd want this to be as good.
-----
Illusion: I thought Boruto was pretty good.
-----
KojiKnight: Maybe you should put "Special Ed" in the title...
-----
The Silver: Because it isn't even good?!

Anton Sugar: I have the hat that I've been rocking for years.
-----
Bakercat: I have the “My avatar”, which I think is the most appropriate and fitting name for it. It is very high quality, and the original has certainly garnered some compliments.
-----
ThLunarian: It's a really nice hat, but it's probably inappropriate for an 11 year old kid to wear.
-----
BDS: I've never had one, but I have seen some of the designs on Tumblr.
-----
Shugga: I've never had one
-----
John Kowalski: I don't really have one, but I have a couple of my own favourites
-----
Westbahnhof: I have a custom avatar that I hope to have for a future wedding.
It's so classy, but I hate it. I'd rather it be a picture of me, a picture of myself with a nice bow and a nice personalized message.
-----
John Kowalski: Oh wow.

~!~How do you deal with the stress of dealing with family members that are not your parents?

John Doe: This topic is obviously not for anyone's reading pleasure but just something that came to my mind while browsing the thread and wanted to see if anyone here had experience with dealing with family members that were not their parents.
I've always thought about what it's like to deal with stress of family dealing with serious illness or death of a loved one but what about dealing with stress of dealing with the occasional death of such a minor but what about the actual worst case scenario?
How do you deal with family members that are not your parents?
What does your approach be when dealing with stress of family dealing with serious illness or death?
How do you deal with the "stigma" society has created for dealing with the serious issues of family relationships?
What do you do when you can't deal with the reality of dealing with serious illness or death of a loved one but you just can't deal with the reality of dealing with the reality of death of your parents?
-----
CormoranStrike: Depends. Sometimes I say "I'm not going to kill them" or "I'm not going to do it" to my parents, and they say "Why, did you do anything to them".
-----
JehutyRunner: I don't. I try and politely help. If they're not in pain yet, I'm there to help. If it's too far, I'm there to walk over them.
-----
GARlock Spiral: Not for me. I try and politely help, and if they're still alive I try and politely help. If they're just getting some time off, I'm there to help.
-----
FUME5: Until they die.
-----
CormoranStrike: Cause you can't even get the undertaker made. Only you can get the corkcap in there.
-----
CitizenVectron: "It's not about hurting, it's about fucking dying" is always my response to this, as I blame my parents for it, and the negative thoughts they're exerting on me.
-----
Dook's Revenge: I just tell them to get over it and forget about it.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: this so much, i hate it

zma1013: I get the opposite problem.

~!~What kind of Brandy is in your fridge?

TheAbsolution: Brandy is a great brand and I had a crazy nostalgia hunt going on back when I used to use them. I was just curious what kind of flavors you all have and how they compare.
-----
Powdered Egg: Brandy sauce with chocolate chip. I've had it on Subway sandwiches the whole time I lived there.
-----
Cocolina: It's puffed up and full of carmel. Also, McDonald's has the best burgers.
-----
Kevers: WTF, I didn't even know this was a thing.
-----
Powdered Egg: Yes, it's called Double Down.
-----
Uncle0wnage: My roommate got one of those for Christmas recently. It's like going through a long presser with a loaded pistol.
-----
Dishwalla: Brandy or regular champagne
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: A good tuna sandwich.
-----
WhoTurgled: it's a nice tuna sandwich with a nice ass

~!~My friend and another friend are having a debate about the merits of charging a phone.

Mugy: So i'm just randomly thinking about this today, i'm hot as shit. Since we're both 19, i don't know if it's just me saying stupid shit anymore or that we shouldn't talk in public. My friend is also 19, i don't want to get in a fight with him over a phone because he doesn't want to pay for one.
I'm trying to reason with him that this is against the rules of the forum and i'm just not interested in the convo, why not just talk in public? We are just friendly enough that we can hang out in the car and fight or something.
My other friend also agrees with the argument that the price is too high.
Should i follow the rule of 3 or should i just explain myself?
UPDATE:
So my friend seriously just said he wants to chill and go clubbing with the rest of the guys.
he also told me that having a conversation like this with other guys is the most boring thing ever, so i don't know why i'm wasting my time with him like this.
edit: i'm a 17 year old and i know i'm old in a way.

Andrew Korenchkin: Charge the fucker?

Aquavelvaman: Charge the fucker

hjort: Charge the fucker.

Krejlooc: I'm guessing this is the wrong place to begin with, but I thought you'd ask the other thread.
I don't mean to sound snarky, but I'm also not sure if this is a bad idea actually.

Andrew Korenchkin: I just realized this thread is a thread about stupid shit
-----
in.: Charge the fucker.
-----
Beef Supreme: I don't know how to be your friend, but I thought you guys were reaching an audience, and I'm not going to apologize for that.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: I'm not looking for a conversation where you explain something that seriously makes sense to you.

~!~WaPo: The Trump administration is suing Time Warner to block its merger with Sinclair Media

KSweeley: The Trump administration is suing Time Warner, a Time Warner joint venture to fight the merger of two competing internet providers, for injunct November, 2018 in Virginia:
-----
Ogodei: I wonder if this will also prevent AT&T from getting sued over the merger T-Mobile/ Verizon had with Time Warner, as they had previously denied the merger to T-Mobile and then later claimed that they never had to sue AT&T for damages as well:
-----
The Real Jeremy: This seems like a good idea.
-----
AlteredBeast: This is so fucking stupid. Time Warner is a dumpster fire right now and they are going to get sued over this.
-----
marrec: Well, that's not good.
But I mean I guess it's possible the AT&T thing is just a publicity stunt lite.
-----
Kasai: I can't believe this is starting to happen. 
What's the timeline?
-----
Nokterian: I mean this alot.
-----
jviggy43: Well I guess this is starting to happen.
-----
Aquavelvaman: The more they try to get a Time Warner for themselves or for the other companies that are trying to get into the internet.
-----
The Real Jeremy: I think that is how this works. Time Warner is a public company and the government just has to approve Comcast's bid for Time Warner.

~!~How much do you spend on your phone?

entremet: When I started using my phone I spent around $150 on my phone. Now that I'm going to buy a Pixel 3 and get a new iPhone X I'll likely spend around $200. 
The thing is, I'm not talking about in-store salesmen, but online. I know that price estimates vary quite a bit.
How much do you guys spend on your phone?
-----
PantherLotus: I don't understand the question I'm asking OP.
I'm in the market for a new phone and my personal phone is $700-ish.
-----
Mr. Tibbs: My phone is $500ish, and I'm not sure how I did even scale it. I was going to suggest using a cheap cheap android case, but I ended up going with a cheap cheap t-phone (LG DV40, not Pixel 3).
Weird thing, though. I just want a bigger screen.
-----
digitalrelic: I've spent almost $200 on the phone.
-----
Infinitebento: $500
-----
RoadHazard: I'm in the same boat as you OP. I've been spending about $200 on phones for the last few years, not counting the Samsung S4 that I used to be on and the Moto X4 Play that I had a problem on. I'm sure there are better options out there.
-----
Border: $500 to get that top of the line, low budget phone. I’d rather get a $100ish phone and a $20-$30 phone.
-----
PeskyToaster: I use my phone a lot and I buy enough that it isn't a problem.
-----
Transistor: $500 to have a phone that is at least $500 budget.
-----
FaceHugger: $500 to have a phone that I like and I don't need.

Robdraggoo: Uh I don't really have a facebook account. I just use my account to keep in contact with friends.

klastical: I use my facebook account to follow back on to FB messenger. I'm not sure if it's the best way, but it is probably the best way. Especially if you have a group messaging your group to who you'd say it's your group, but I'm not that familiar with group messaging apps. I do use it for ERA and ERA.

How would you like to learn more about this amazing series? Post below!

TheGamingNewsGuy: I think I'd like to know more about this amazing series

TheGamingNewsGuy: This is pretty much the title of the comic
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes and it's called Crisis on Superheroes #1000
Also I am not sure if it's allowed to use the Superhero term but it's a very similar series to Crisis on Superheroes
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes and Crisis on Superheroes title is Crisis on Superheroes
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Well it sounds like they are using the term Superheroes as well and I am using the comic name to avoid the TV show title
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes and the TV show name will be the title of the comic.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: This is a pretty fitting way to put this
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: This is pretty much the title of the comic
-----
CoolestSpot: The comic and graphic novels were a huge part of my childhood.
The comic gave me the ability to see the world through the eyes of an alternate reality host and I loved it.
The comic itself is a pretty perfect example of what happens when you flip the coin on a 1st world.
The alternate realities are also happy and perpetuating but now they're super bad.
The book is the gateway to a happy life that goes on way longer than the comic
Now the comics are the logical translation

~!~The legacy of Martin Luther King and MLK - is there a reason to celebrate the occasion?

fanboi: I was thinking about this earlier today- the main reason for this thread seems to be the two decades of mass imprisonment of the Black Panthers, and the national awareness of MLK.
I do not feel that the time should be dedicated to the memory of MLK, or the appreciation of his ideals.
I appreciate the effort and effort of people who have been deprived and brutalized in ways that were not the default response when watching shows and movies about him. 
But the reason to celebrate is not so much about MLK. It is the present moment, and more than that, is that we're not as aware of him and the struggles surrounding him as we were when he died.
This brings a lot into focus.
1) I think that there is a reason to celebrate and value the lives he lived for a time.
2) I think that there is a reason to celebrate and value his life, and I think there is a reason to celebrate MLK Jr's life as well.
While the focus on him could be misguided, I don't think it is misguided to think that celebrating his life will be effective or effective.
-----
Oheao: There is a reason to celebrate his life and be aware of his struggle.
-----
fanboi: I think that is a legitimate reason to be aware of him.
-----
Oheao: I think it is important to acknowledge that we are not as familiar with his life and struggles as we might be with the struggles he was in.
-----
fanboi: I think that this is also where the focus is.
-----
Oheao: This is a good point. I think that we're not as familiar with him and his struggles as we might be with his struggles.
-----
Oheao: I think that this is a good point. I think that's what's more important is that we are aware of his struggle.
-----
Oheao: I think it's just the right message for us to talk about that we can't talk about just positive things for a lot of people. We can talk about how we feel for people who have been deprived and horrific, but we really need to do that, if we're going to get to know the people. The important element is that we will never forget

~!~Ankleons can be an issue when it comes to how you interact with the community

Terra Firma: I've never really been involved with the community outside of a few specific groups like my dad. I've become more of a follower of the community since I've gotten my Masters in Accounting. I've become more of a total follower of ERA with each day I've read something like this. I've always had social skills that I wanted to get into but never had the chance until now. I'm not sure if that's what this thread is about.
One of my friends used to do this with me. That's not really a big deal. I don't know how he managed to pull it off since I'm relatively young. I do have some social skills that I have that I really do not have. In fact I do not think I have any at all, even though I have some good ones. I just have a problem with having way too many friends.
I'm not sure if this is common at all. I guess this is the excuse I came up with when I read this topic. I am not sure if it's the default one. I am a fairly solid person, I got into a relationship as soon as I got my hair cut, I'm a pretty solid person, but I'm very bad with time and details. So I guess I can't really apply it to myself. I think I'm probably better off without any friends.
And it's not just ERA, I've got a couple people here who have pretty bad friends that I figure just a lot of people can pull off. But I never really thought much about it outside of the fact that I have a fairly decent job. I think I'd be fine without any of the people I have on here, but I never really thought much about it until now. I guess I just feel sort of weird having so many people on here.
I guess that's kind of it. I just don't really feel like there needs to be more people around me. I like to think there are more people out there, but I don't really see any of the "friends." I guess it could just be a lack of trust I guess. Like I said, I kind of just feel weird with a few friends. Maybe I should just figure out how to interact with them better. I just don't feel like I have to interact with them at all.

~!~My friend just had a vasectomy

Mr. Poolman: I've always had a vasectomy. I'm 32 and I've had it done about nine years now. I think I have a natural birth baby around 9 and I think I had a natural birth baby around 10. 
I'm a big guy. I've had my finger prick. I've had a few others as well. One that's a natural birth baby is the one I had on my left ring that was total pain. I had to throw up and couldn't stand it anymore.
Last year I had surgery and after a week I had a sore thumb. I was unable to take anymore, I had to put my fingers in my palm and it was like a gummy bear feeling.
After about 10 minutes of the thumb pain went away again. I had to go to an ER and they told us to let it heal for a few days. Then about a week after that I suddenly felt a slight discomfort in my left ring.
When I got back on the ring I was so exhausted that I didn't feel any pain aside from that pain. I thought that maybe I got a mild sciatica or a slight tachycardia. The doctor said I'll need to rest for a week or two before the tachycardia test would show any pain.
I was going to take some ibuprofin and a small dab of Vaseline, it had been a while since I've had one. But my friend said the two things really didn't match up.
So I took one of those Claritin tablets and I felt like I had a heart attack. It didn't really help, as my heart rate dropped. It was painful and it was mostly temporary, but it did give me some pain resistance.
I was feeling great, but then I went to the ER.
I'm pretty sure I was in the bathroom, in there testing all the patients.
After I got off the phone they had blood coming out of their testicles. They said they were going to check again, but they wanted me to take one pill in case I contracted a cold while having a testicular cancer.
I took a swab and gave the swab in to see if it was true (I was having a hyposmia) and there was no sign of cancer.
Then they gave me another one in which they had a problem with the DNA.

~!~"The Aquaman" will end with the end of the current story for the current movie or some other story?

Uzumaki Goku: I've seen some speculation that "The Aquaman" will end with the end of the current story for the current movie, but after the recent news that "Black Panther" had a theatrical trailer, I'm not sure if that's the case. I just wanted to ask everyone if they'd be ready or waiting for "The Dark Knight Returns" to come out. 
As someone who grew up with the comics, I'm not the biggest fan of the "superhero" craze, but I think it's time for the "superhero" craze to end. The DC movie genre has been going on for over a decade and I think we're in the last major "superhero" craze that started in the 2000's, with the "late 1800's" and the "late 1900's" (as in the heyday of the 1800's in the US). What are the current odds that this current craze will end in the end of the current movie?
-----
Mariolee: I'd love a "Dark Knight Returns" but I doubt it.
-----
crimsonECHIDNA: I hope they do one as a stand-alone film.
-----
Rob: I'm not too sure they'll do one. They've been doing them for 20+ years and they're just as relevant as ever.
-----
Anubis: A movie that ends on a cliff?
-----
Mikey: I'm a huge Batman fan and would love to see the DC movie version, but I doubt it.
-----
Slayven: I think you need a movie to end a movie movie that's ending it for.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: The Aquaman movie will have a film as the end for it, iirc.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: I'd be down for a sequel to the current story, but I'm not sure that's the case, it's not the case for a movie that's to end a movie movie.
-----
Sho_Nuff82: I would put a stop to it. If they had a first draft with the most likely version being the Dark Knight Returns, the entire franchise will end before a movie. 
I think Warner Bros. would be smart to not do that
====================
~!~Do you think that the US will still be in the ACA after 40 years or will it be delayed to the point of default?

Secret Fawful: I don't think I'll ever consider a transition to a private insurance system.
-----
Username1198: Dumb, im gonna guess that 40 years is not too far.
-----
Wyman Manderly: I can't see a time in my life when I'd want to pay more than $10/month, so I'm guessing I'll be in the clear
-----
Gandie: I think we'll still have private in the next 40 years.
-----
Stop It: I'm not sure. I fully expect private insurers to be self imposed pots until healthcare is done.
-----
Kirblar: I'm pretty sure we're going to have private, private insurance after 40 years - that's the only way health insurance can go.

~!~So here in the United States, is there any law preventing you from donating blood?

LionPride: The thread about stem cells being used as a viable treatment for a blood disorder was originally posted here in the old thread so I've been thinking I might get around to it later. :/
Now, I'm not sure if this is a case of 'if we can't cure diseases, we have to cures ourselves' or if we have a cure-able disease that no government will allow us to cure. But I'm generally sure that if we can cure any disease, we have a cureable disease, just by "curing" ourselves of something that would work.
I was reading about the 'salvage" project which is essentially by cutting out parts of your body and using that to create a new type of cell in your brain. This basically involves killing off parts of your body, then harvesting that type of cell in the new type of cell, reselling it in a new cell in your brain, and transplanting that into a brain that's functional and healthy.
So I get this, I'm a pretty big fan of this kinda stuff, and I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas.
-----
Rackham: I think donating blood can be tricky. You have to get moisture in the blood. You rub it down and it comes out fine. You have to get a bunch of moisture in the tissue around it so that it keeps getting rinsed out. You can't get moisture in the blood, but you can get in a lot of water by attaching a thin silicon film to the film and letting the remaining moisture move around during a few moments. You also need a special guard that can keep the remaining moisture out. You also need a special guard that takes up a quarter of your body if you're dragging around a bunch of it around your body. You also need a special guard that takes up a bunch of your body if you're dragging around a bunch of it around your body.
-----
Squirrel09: Yes, but I think you have to get it done fairly often. I think the most you can do is get it done by your dentist/surgeon and have it dry out and slip on a ring that way.
-----
LionPride: Bumping this because I'm thinking about doing it :(
I've been thinking about it for weeks though

~!~Christopher Robin (2018 film)

lil jetski: This film is a masterpiece. It's a masterpiece.
I have never seen such a beautiful and clever adventure as this. I've seen every part of this:
Spoiler
-----
TheBeardedOne: I saw it, but haven't seen it in a while. I'd have to watch it again for sure.
I didn't realize they switched out the TV show. I may have to.
-----
Ravelle: I've watched it and enjoyed it enough to play the new game.
-----
Dommo: Love this movie. Can't believe it's been so long since I saw it.
-----
shintoki: I wasted my time waiting for this, I'll have to get on that.
-----
Velord: I've seen it but have never been ready to see it in full.
-----
FloatingDivider: Actually I'm seeing it tomorrow and I have to say I'm really looking forward to it. I know it's supposed to be out in the UK but I'm interested to see it in cinemas.
-----
Kirblar: I watched the movie a few months ago and I still find it incredibly beautiful.
-----
Rob: That's the part I want from my heart.
-----
Clydefrog: I've seen it and I'm a huge fan of it. I'm so down for it.

~!~Invisible Cities - Netflix


Dr. Caroll: My favorite part of this show is the two leads who are actually the backbone of the protagonists.
-----
PeskyToaster: I like the show. Love all the characters.
-----
Khanimus: I was expecting something kind of lame, but I'm not surprised.
-----
Dr. Caroll: I'm not sure if this is a great judgment or a terrible one.
-----
DrROBschiz: I was really surprised by the two leads in the show
I watched season one pretty late but I believe it was really released around april or early fall
-----
MrNewVegas: It was a good piece of work from the writers/showrunners. I didn’t expect it to end so that way.
-----
Dr. Caroll: Yeah, it was definitely a good piece of work.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: I like it too. I don't know why but it was good.
-----

====================
~!~What is going on with the new Kylo Ren / Reyverse?

Yukari: I am sitting here watching episode 7 of the new show and they are talking about Rey and Kylo Ren.
I'm watching episode 7 not Kylo Ren.
-----
Brock Reiher: He's a Reptile
-----
Rackham: Reptiling lol

Realeza: Are they just going with the Reptile Throne?
-----
The Gunslinger: He's a Reptile.

The Gunslinger: He's a Reptile.

~!~Best Android and Kindle devices?

AlexFlame116: I'm pretty new to the whole Android and I'm honestly surprised how quickly I blew past my 5 year old self. I've been using my Kindle for a few months now and it's been working fine for the last month. However, I really want to upgrade to a better tablet. I really just want a tablet with a battery for quick and easy browsing while watching YouTube or Netflix. With a tablet I have the ability to read books on my smartphone with the screen but with an actual display so I just want something that can read on my phone. I've been looking around for the best Android devices so I can get the best deals. I'm not really a gamer or anything so I'll mostly just look for something that costs around 500 dollars or so.
What are the best Android tablets and best Kindle e-readers?
-----
Skel1ingt0n: I own a Samsung LT3808 that I use all the time for browsing and video conferencing.
Otherwise, I have a TPformer Uno. Amazing battery life and great screen. Amazing for the money.
-----
jon bones: i got the sony deogle keyboard and i'm loving it
-----
xxracerxx: What's the best Android tablet that you can get for 500?
Also I'm in Japan, but Amazon does not ship to the US.
-----
ArmsofSleep: I have the OnePlus 5T and I love it. Plus, the e-ink has a great long term battery life and solidifies it as a really reliable tablet device.
-----
Sankt Ra: Don't know about others but the Xr is great for cheap (and on paper) value. The screen is nice too.
-----
Lump: I'm a fan of the S8, but not sure I can stomach the unibrow. I've yet to run into any major issues, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to get the last year of the warranty in writing, or if that's a dealbreaker.
-----
AlexFlame116: I'm curious if I'll get the refurbished model or the refurbished model from Best Buy at all.
I'm going to Best Buy today since it's a new day out and I'll have my Asus Transformer Asus tablet.

Matrix XII: I’
====================
~!~At what age can you be considered old?

Halo 2: Like how do you say that if you were around when the 2nd Amendment happened?
Do you think you are old now and you would be considered old?
I say you would be around 10-12 when the 2nd Amendment Happened era ago.
-----
Lumination: I'm considered old.
-----
Sectorseven: I'd be 10-12 by the time the 2nd Amendment hits.
-----
DrewFu: Maybe 10-12 years old by the time the 2nd Amendment hit the ground. I would be between 10-14 by the time the 3rd came around.
-----
BLEEN: 10-14.
-----
Muppet of a Man: I wouldn't be 10 years old by the time the 2nd happened.
-----
GK86: I'd be a decade old by the time the 2nd was over.
-----
Hokahey: Yes.
-----
Grimminski: I'd be around 10 by the time the 2nd happened.
-----
Deft Beck: "My life is already over... I have no kids."

====================
~!~In Japan, a few Japanese girls are just having mini sex

The Artisan: I'm in the mood for some mini sex, but I think I need to turn this into a series first.
The manga is more or less light on details, so the girls do this in the background while sitting on a chair.
I'm thinking, what the hell?
-----
Fuu: Why? You’re so cute too.
-----
L Thammy: You know what? I'm not going to lie, I'm jealous.
-----
TheChuggernaut: I'm jealous because you brought up that one guy that was getting a huge erection in your butt.
-----
The Artisan: What
-----
Cyanity: Your butt is probably a magnet for a lot of people. I don't know how many times I've had this happen to me.
-----
ry-dog: That's why you have to stretch your butt out
-----
Muffin: I wish they'd just force them to penetrate the butt.
-----
Mesoian: And I'm not even sure this is the first time someone has said this. I think I've had two Japanese guys show me a couple times.
-----
Abu: lmfao

====================
~!~Get a vasectomy - Advice needed

Blue Lou: I just got out of the cycle to getting a vasectomy. I'm a male with a mid-life crisis, so I don't know if I'll have any kids at all by the time I'm 50. I'm still young, and I don't want kids.
I was told in medical forum that I should only do it if I'm at a point in your life where you want to be a father. I did my research and was able to get the right information for a vasectomy.
-----
Luchashaq: My issue is that I'm a very unhappy and depressed man who'd rather be dead, so I feel like I'm stuck in a box to be a father.
-----
Tiberius: Sorry to hear that op but I'm not sure what to do. I'm 34 and I feel like I have to do a lot to make up for what I have. I don't know what to do.
-----
AoM: Give up hope and live a life of solitude. 
I went through a vasectomy about a year and a half ago. Took about 5-6 days to go from your usual "normal" rhythm to the point where I could feel my heart rate and oxygen levels go down. Also started working out harder and harder with each session.
Then after a few weeks my heart stopped and I just got a vas and it was my favorite thing in the world.
-----
Praxis: I'm 35 and have had three jobs in my life and am very financially stagnant. I've been in a vasectomy clinic in the US and it's like no surprise that I'm having this problem. 
But I'm also very happy. I've got a good job and a good child. It's not something to be afraid of, I'm not in a perfect place but I do have a good life ahead of me.

~!~What is your favorite snack?

hobblygobbly: Biggest one you've ever had? What do you consider to be the best?
For me, I think I had sour and chocolate cheddar cheese fries. (not the french onion kind, but the godly stuff I could just eat all day)
Edit: also, for protein powder, I got the real deal: 
I'm also partial to the cookies: 
-----
Truly Gargantuan: Food Does Not Mean Good
-----
Chivalry: Cereal or Chunky chips
-----
SliceSabre: A piece of fruit.

The Almighty Tria: Oreos

El Bombastico: But we'll somehow get a Spider-Man movie...
-----
PatMan: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse makes more than Avengers. It's the first film that's actually good.
-----
berzeli: I wonder if is gonna do well on Thursday?
-----
Slayven: What is the last movie that was decent?
-----
Gravity Insanity: Damn Spider-Verse is doing okay.
-----
TerminusFox: Infinity War on the way
-----
Slayven: Spider-Man and the Human Torch sharing the same screen is going to be a disaster

Pachimari: Infinity War is going to gross more than Avengers. I believe.

kswiston: I don't know if that's fair, but I would imagine it is way, way too soon.

====================
~!~Should I watch it?

SoundCheck: I've watched the first 13 episodes of the Netflix original anime The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. I watched the original episodes on a binge and I feel like it's a good enough show to warrant watching. What I don't get is why the actors are doing what they do. Are they having fun acting like old friends? Is it a fun show? Why is the premise too weird?
I guess I'd like to hear from ERA about it.
-----
PSqueak: I think it's the best anime ever made, but i do wonder about the creator's intentions.
-----
Zhukov: I don't know, it's not great, but I do understand why they're doing it.
I know I watched the first season on Netflix, but I haven't finished it in a while.
-----
SoundCheck: Wait a second.
-----
Kurita: Yeah I think it's a nice show.
-----
Cantaim: Yes I think you're being a cheapskate if you don't like it. 
I think there is something to it. It's also kind of a little slow, even if the premise is something you could take to the next level.
-----
Rackham: If it's like most anime series it's not great. It's better than it has any right to be.
-----
Gundam: I know this topic isn't as pertinent but if you feel the same then don't be an AnimeEra member.
-----
SoundCheck: I am sorry for the lack of information about the show.
-----
Rackham: It's a pretty good show. The main character is a dumbass, self-proclaimed 'hack' (?) who has to work to pay for his magic prayer and fill it up to the brim with magic. It's a pretty good show.

~!~Official 'Crazy Rich Asians' Scores Surprise Oscar for American Film 'Crazy Rich Asians'

WrenchNinja: 
-----
Bigkrev: I think the reason this film has more wins than it has Oscar buzz because of Wong's performance in Ghost In The Shell... I never really thought this movie would win so close to the time it did.
-----
BlackGoku03: What did they score for Fist of The North?
-----
Birdseye: I'm not familiar with the film but I remember seeing it in a box office review and hating it
-----
Khanimus: I'd be interested in a documentary about it.
-----
Slayven: Where's Wong's Ghost in the Shell?
I am not sure if he has made more than a handful of movies in the past decade.
-----
Khanimus: That's what they're saying. They're saying that he made at least half a dozen movies in the past decade.
-----
Einchy: I’m probably a bit surprised this wasn’t nominated.
-----
Bigkrev: The documentary just came out, and it did cost a cool $90M
-----
Bigkrev: So Kim Watley did a great job as Wong in that one?
-----

====================
~!~How do I watch Mac?

MrH: Currently on Netflix and I'm enjoying watching some classic movies and TV's, but I'm starting to get worried that I might not enjoy watching them without them.
I don't want to watch them on all the DVD's I've seen recently, I just want to have a place to stream them.
This is my first time watching a movie- I haven't seen it in a few years,
-----
Horse Armour: Watch the movie first, then.
-----
danowat: This.
2nd DVD doesn't give away the whole plot.
-----
shaneo632: This.
-----
Krejlooc: Watch it first, then just watch it after.
-----
Jonnax: If you only want to watch it after you watch the rest of the series, do it.
-----
Jindrax: This
-----
Tagyhag: Watch the first movie, watch the rest.
-----
Horse Armour: You just watched the whole film first then.
-----
PlanetSmasher: Watch them both first and then watch the rest. The rest of the series is like the 4th or 5th movie, so make sure you watch them after.

~!~Sony Xperia 3, iPhone XR, OnePlus 6T, and iPad Pro owners - thoughts on the 3/6T?

BeforeU: I am looking to buy a phone that has a headphone jack. I am interested in these three phones:
iPhone Xr
The 6t is a 4 year old phone that has my moms Apple giftcard, the Xr is a 4 year old phone that has my mother apple giftcard, and the 6t is a 4 year old phone that has my stepdad apple giftcard. I think the 6t is my biggest problem. I am considering upgrading my iPhone 6 to the 6t, but I also want to prioritize features first before I leave the house. Thoughts? Is the 6t worth it? Is the 6t worth it for both family and hardware reasons?
-----
PeskyToaster: It's not that old, it's not that good either.
-----
Mcfrank: You could get a 6S if you want the feature. If not, no harm, just get a 6S.
-----
BeforeU: What does the name give?
iPhone XR
-----
Kthulhu: It's not that old, it's not that good either.
-----
dallow_bg: It's ok. It's not great but better than nothing.
-----
Futureman: It's not that bad either.
OnePlus 6T is a good phone, but it's not really a phone I'd even call.
-----
Drewton: It's not that bad, the 6T is a great phone.
-----
BeforeU: I want to upgrade my iPhone Xr to the 6T. I just want to be able to play my ps games on the go, and pick up all the apps I want.
-----
BuddyDharma: It's a decent phone, but it's not the most powerful. I'd say the Xr is worth it, but if you're just playing games on it, I'd just recommend the S4 or whatever the best one is.

~!~Avengers: Infinity War is now on $10/$10/$10 for 24 hours

ManaByte:

Buckle: Good.
The only movie that sucked was the avengers trilogy.
There's a good chance they'll make another Avengers movie eventually.
I think the only thing this one will be on is in theatres.
-----
TheGhost: They are only going to get $3 lol
-----
Indy in the Fridge: This is the only thing this franchise has going for it?
-----
Dennis8K: Damn.
-----
Jombie: Did you not read the comics?
-----
N.Domixis: $3 for 24 hours?
$11 for 24 hours?
$10 for 24 hours?
-----
Trickster: And here I am, not knowing what the movie is, I don't want to see it
-----
jelly: Avatar, Spider-Man, Spider-Man, the Darksiders, Black Panther, Logan, all have good theaters.
-----
Geist: Can't wait, I'm looking forward to seeing the rest.

~!~Eminem's new song "Somewhere Under the Sea" is a song about loneliness

ElectricBlanketFire: I'm in love with this song.
-----
hydrophilic attack: sounds like the kind of song about a terrible romance
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: It's depressing.
-----
Griselbrand: Sounds like a kind of song about a terrible relationship.
-----
El Bombastico: Does that count?
-----
T'Challa Shakur: What in the world. 
I'm in love.
-----
Luap: Y'all should really put a stop to the cynical song-collecting, because this is the type of song I'm looking forward to most of the time.
-----
AlteredBeast: This is a really good song.
-----
Powdered Egg: Loved it. I like that 'love' at the end is real.
-----
Sasliquid: I’m not sure if I like it this way but I really do like the chorus of it and the video’s music is great.
