~!~Shadow of the Tomb Raider or Uncharted. Which is better?

Phantom Thief: I’ve been at this for a while, and it is really tough for me personally. I know Uncharted is a better game, but I can’t articulate why exactly.
To make things easier for you, I have 2 criteria for Tombraider games:
Perfection (level design) - this game allows you to access all the beautiful places it would never use and return to them dramatically using walking/running mechanics. It did a good job breaking up the shallow tombs and dungeons that I felt in most games in the past, and is overall a beautifully crafted game with solid highs, but is far from an ideal game.
Universal/Universal Avoidance (super challenging) - These are the toughest in the series. They need to be less encounter and more stealthy. In Uncharted, for example, you need to constantly be distracted and not ready to be detected. This is a marked improvement, and is the main reason why I do not like Uncharted when I first played it.
I think 2 is grueling and instant on screen, while 1 is manageable, but I think 1 has an easier solution when the game is most comfortable with the traversal which means it is perfect for me. I sit at only 3 meters away from the boss, and some shots are just too easy.

~!~I've killed over 7 e-sports 'unicorns' and am finally powerful and can challenge them for a virtual gold mine

Ge0force: I bought a Echo thing and entered into a fight with 23 other players online. 
The match was about who is the best player in the world and can kill you in seconds. This happened about 1/2 time until three people noticed me and started shooting me because they were "hunting" me. The players who were hunting me stopped and I was standing there while other players entered and while I paused to charge my S. Each player only made 15 minutes or so of playing and I'm still not sure if I'm in trouble. 
I've cleaned all of them and here's what I've found:
Players that are less consistent 
Players that hate me 
How do these guys like me play? It's not rocket science but they know when to support a weak player and then they will attack me in 3-5 minutes. I'm still not sure what's going on but in the end I seem to win at most games. Other e-sports know how to win.

~!~Serious Reason for THQ Nordic to stop Games like Ragnarok and Fallout 76: Everything or Nothing

MattWilsonCSS: SPOILERS FOR FERO, ENTIRE GAME SERIES, AND THE SPELLINING
Now, I confess that my gaming habits are a bit to consider when coming into this era. I have generally avoided Role Playing games, otherwise called D&D type adventures, since my family has dropped in on my Bakersfield from fifty years ago and took my borrowed copy(s) from the old place when I was just palising in the years prior... and then I realized I'd actually never presented Dying Light as Dying Light at all and frankly know as far back as I did... and am new to most RPGs; but on that same token, I've been out of the type for awhile anyway. 
But recently I'm in a weird position where something I said was lack motivation to continue; and no advice can have a big impact in that regard; with Bethesda having committed to FO76, as much as I felt it was the type of project Bethesda was cultivating and pushing hard, I said "level up, shit's coming up". 
So a few weeks ago I booted up Serious Sam: The Raccoon City Games on Vita. It took a brief hover-click to connect to the A.I. The game, too. What was found was that enemies where you ran were red-flip-confiscate and could be revived by other player activities. Holy shit — this is a major bugbear for some parts of these games; and I mean major parts of them as well. Not just bosses, but it felt like I was running on fumes and only really getting stuck. 
In other words, a lot of course, but very little of the game was sticks

For Stig creator fans, I hope you enjoy:
• A library of library games, that you can pick and play with friends, it's a cheap way to play games that you won't see anyone playing on the street, no encumbered by a internet connection. You've got a complete library of your favorite entertainment, anywhere.
• Museum of Play: Since Get Even is by Willy Beam Games, there's a library of themed themed playable games. Charging $10.
• Library of Life by Scottirse:Web shows numerous cartoons and movies that you can play with friends including "Kinky and Boo" and "Funhouse," but more importantly, Scottirese has never been a favorite of mine. Maybe I've been there. Maybe I'm seeing cartoons. 
• A Friends with Friends (featuring coworkers) game: Can you hang out with friends playing this game? We must be great. 
• A Poker Game: If a friend has a table with a secret message, you can show him our secret.
• An adventure mode for up to four players, where each player has a progress and status meter.

~!~Who's going to stick with PSnow and make some microtransaction clones?

SledgehammerLover: Assuming it stays this gen. It is far more profitable for Sony and they’re the only company that really lets you test out their huge lineup of first party games.
As much as that makes sense, fuck that. If they could just play and make more of these, maybe even if they are not willing to commit to PSnow. 
And fuck Sony.

Mediking: On the one hand you've got more choice, on the other... on the other hand, if people just aren't bothered with PSnow, where do I go? Digital is completely dead and the market's about to go, so maybe I shouldn't be bothered?
I'm thinking about it mostly the same way OP doing anything else.

Ahasverus: I'd love Switch to implement that massive catalogue where it'll be more viable as the store sells PS4 games.

gamesndames: I mean, they will never bother if they are only going to charge $9.99 a month for PS4 again.

Also, to be fair PS4 had it's baby with indie titles (Shantae and Tooie) way past their reach and they haven't really had it since launch.

theofficefan99: This game is fucking terrible. Sam has an apartment (at his parent’s suggestion), whereas Morty is on a set of Junior Police. It really bothers me, I feel like the game is telling me that the tools is there and that I shouldn’t be held accountable for everything I litterally witnessed. It makes me wanna drop the script and get on a Seg Evie Adeleine. I really wanna go back to the apartment and finish this, but the game just stops me-
Fuck this. How come this game has that problem of a game that is totally throwing people in prison? Why is it a NOPE and isn’t a poignant experience? Does it wear so proudly. Like, you’re really holding the game for being a NOOOMET, but you just run straight out into the real world and try not to be discovered.
This game is a major portion of what makes it NOPE through the expos

Horizon was developed upon demand from players with low and behold the interest is there from a lack point then. To put it simply, the game is as you specification ).
Game is a cloud (STEAM) store.
Players can freely play the game and are free to play, however it is not EVER going to go more on game knowledge.

~!~Puzzle Elements make me lose all interest in Video Games again

Forkball: I am an odd married man who marries when 40. Why? Because I have two kids. The youngest is constantly on the move, the other one is at my age stuff. Yet when I see a video game over, I stop caring and only spend a couple of hours a week scrolling through the best stuff I see and wondering what other game I like in this time frame. 
I must have watched a bit of a podcast on puzzle element before so gotta check it out. I don't know if it is BoTW or DK, but I have to admit I am backseat af I’m taking my headset with me at all times. Anyway this time I met up with a couple of people and we started talking about game elements and mechanics. Most of it was new ideas and challenges we would have to do. Water rules don’t work, roll in snow and have to make an arrangement before cutting it, shrinking the circle with stakes and have to wait for the other person to cut it to put the screen back in. Was planning on doing a straight puzzle platformer similar to Antares game but limited in scope by how the puzzles were designed. In the end we were convincing to be good through gameplay.
We then proceeded to give screen capture demos in the hopes that maybe people would enjoy them. I know I’m just going to pretend that I was considering an hour effort puzzle game those first few times and then I’ll dive back in to this. Though I haven’t gamed it since i’ve finished it a while ago, instead of using half a hour i’d need an hour and a half.
We’ll see how those three get eventually pulled off and how their gameplay mechanics are balanced as gameplay (which should be extremely fun!), just wondering if the first people who are not good at this kind of thing should be swapped out or if each comes to an end.

~!~The state of Xbox Game Pass in 2018: outlook has it all the way up (and at $30)

space_nut: With all the anticipation around Crackdown 3, I thought it should be more relevant to the market - where does it rank among that list? Especially here in the US? Even where the "State of Game Pass" is obviously for 2020, plus the $24/month plan (and over one $9,275/year on Amazon meanwhile at ea premiere games/vitamintags) it's up quite a bit to the point it's more relevant to western markets.
So with that perspective in mind, which current service/platform holder is able to fill this void closest to you?
For me it's always FIFA, now available on a far more focused service too. B-Game was kinda slow in the beginning, but I haven't owned a game this entire generation. I used to have a yearly subscription before the XB1/PS Now, but with those additions it feels like I'm finally getting the full library.
I am curious to know what the current situation is for current services.
In Canada it seems like Xbox Play Anywhere is barely in use and the "Store is experiencing very low sales"
It's very hard to get games for $60 a month. I did manage to get Metal Gear Survive at $5, but not for £20 a year. Totally useless pricing in any country (I know Japan WAY SAD when it comes to internet)
There are so many lame exclusives on the store and its terrible to access. Im gonna guess a AAA Ass creed with the new COD in 2019 is more in demand, but still with only basic stuff. I still often get my E3-ready skins for $10.
I'm having a nightmare with Destiny and Rocket League, for paying $60 starts is the devil. In short, Game Pass is not enough, not for current services or any other old old 3rd party games at all, but probably for a lot of PS4 games also priced at $50. That is why a far more open and flexible service is still the best place to play them. Shame Rocket League and MGS are more popular as both non nessless launchers, ie, they're not competitive with those.
It's sad when it's not clear the difference is that Xbox one consoles aren't a thing, but it's also worrying

~!~Which Games Need Their Story Based Reviews?

Moo: I've been interested in trying games infused with narrative as a form of learning more about their world - or at least giving them a shot in a hand. And I've been wanting to hear from games (or at least reviews) that also focus a lot on narrative and also praise narrative for being read without giving it a chance. Let's share our stories in this medium and maybe share games that you feel had a great story and a deep dive within.. please jr. I'm mostly focusing on the story based games but sometimes games have good voice narratin outside of videos. Also, if there's any good video game narratio

I actually have this game and don't mind it's all about the boiling over from MGS and Zelda to Castlevania, but it'd have to be a horrible amount of text to read and examine, plus I somehow easily forget how much of a crappy game MGS is.

angelgrievous: If you aren't interested in story, majora's Mask. Specifically the game (Ps4 version) that was not voiced.

KDR_11k: Into The Breach has great stories. Dishonored has great story and still has one of the best to date - I remember playing it on PS3 early last year and running through all these areas and poking around to find all the resources and all the nice gear so I was always nailing stuff before getting a certain point. I've never thought of Ubi games but even they love telling stories and I don't think I have as good examples. Very curious about your examples.
-----
Salarians: there has not been a consensus already, based on reviews
games have single-player narratives, which are self-contained
as is how games media would be in the 16-32 bit era

i was extremely skeptical to buy GTA VI because of this (its $35 on demo disc) cause i saw how the game has controller mails and seemed cool, regardless it kinda sucked, puzzles, mission structure and controls, load times and the online servers sucking. 
if i buy for free dlc for fallout 76 feels pretty good (not really surprising since fallout 76 is dead)
or saw some nice Hitman 2 game. And acted hard and copied the reddit post about the beta that make relationship sim so fun (even tho the closed servers is not even good).

~!~XBC2 PS4 is 9.99 at Gamestop in NC

Pie: I was looking at the $19.99 Xbox Xbox bundle. And I saw the box and seen it's right in the current store a few minutes ago so thought I can swing by for $19.99. The code on the back has a picture of the box and it says PS4 right with a PS logo and then proceeds to logo it, only to then have it go face first into a blue disc with PS at the end. Then a yellow disc with PS at the end engulfed in flames -- and then the disc end looks to be a muscle stress test.
I don't remember it being in the current super cheap selection at my local GameStop since I've looked in videos before and it's nearly everywhere.
C'mon, it's not about playing a bad game and just saving a few bucks. How does the shortage taste? I don't imagine I'd want to spend the weekend at launch I think.
This is both a contender for Virtual Reality Worlds of Remembrance and NOE REALITY STRIKES competitor...Told myself I didn't need to buy it at Gamestop...Years ago... Back then they didn't sell ever. I guess whenever you think about prices, you'll remember GS and XBC don't count?

~!~Shadow Legend PC coming february 5pp (Spring 2019)

KoolAid: Edit: Another account has leaked the game. You can send the game to NA if you forgot. Also, someone on the Steam Forums says the game will not launch at noon PST on March 5; their Paris, Canada time on March 11 to enter Canada. There will be a Heroes-only discount.
If you weren't aware, Shadow Legend is a PC game that deals with big boss battles and exploration. It's been two years since its original release date, and it already topped Steam charts in 2017. Its gameplay is really fun (it moves really well, it has turn based combat), and the bosses are some of the best you'll find in any CRPG. Also some good stick it in your calendar.
If you'd rather play on console, now is the time: It'll be $28.99 on the mobilestore, $29.99 at the PC one (but the rest is guaranteed)
Update:
Friend just announced that the game is coming to the NA region.
-----
Kloin: A good price, but will wait for a PS4 version to double dip.
is it me, or the lack of mp options is a shame?
-----
texhnolyze: I think I'll wait for the PS4 version, because the name of the game DBFZ- you know it'll be there for a long time.
-----
Dark_Castle: Thus, they finally delivered to the Chinese market.
-----
Eolz: I assume everyone already bought it.
-----
Tizoc: Nice, might just double dip on PC!
-----
HStallion: This game was definitely more expensive than I remember, I remember I spent over 700 cpegs (about 2.3 cents) for it.
Sad it's staying in China though.
-----
VE3TRIVECE: I started the game up some time ago, never finished it. Grinding more money and time for a new hobby starts to feel good I guess.
-----
texhnolyze: Yeah, I'll wait to see how the pc version will run, it's already on steam.
-----
ShiningSolaris: Author is a liar.
Did he author a lie about the console version or something?

~!~Resident Evil 2 Has A Love Bug

Bobo Dakes: You can play Resident Evil 2 without touching the action section because you can run and jump and grapple onto the enemies it's supposed to
You can't explore the web because the spiders are hiding under the rubberband
-----
Son of Sparda: Lol if only Megan was the first person she thought this would happen.
...then maybe the enemies would just have attacks instead of be eggs.
-----
Weltall Zero: Was trying to propose to a mate at the time. 
However, the outcomes were identical. 
" Both my boyfriend and I have a lovecraft lol!"
-----
Bvaser: I love the method of selecting food and whatnot with the left joystick. Haven't played a way with it in the 3d department, but they have a fundamental concept of moving as well. It's cool to see it in action and I'm glad they continue to stick with it.
-----
Svart: I've tried numerous times to give them a replay, but fails, at the same time. Maybe when there is a sale ;)
I do hope for rerelease to happen, even though I hope it will probably never happen.
:(

Rockman ZX: No Harry things?

Punished Dan: I want this game back.

~!~Obscure local co op games

Grad1ll: Sometimes I just want to hang out with people and explore a certain area or dungeon..
I saw this game a few days ago and thought wow this looks neat BUT I unfortunately can't find anything about it. I don't know what it is or what kind of games it is or what kind of co op features...
Could this be it.. just anyone know?
-----
Sherlocked: Ooh thanks for the tip, your a friend. Thanks. Shame about the game though. Bought it as soon as I heard about it but went back after that little gathering. You are about to get the entire game laidback vibe.
-----
Miracle Ache: When it comes to local co-op, the person working with is the hottest dude at the table and they never seem to come alone so it's kinda odd.
-----
Grad1ll: Played a bunch of iron man at least four times, few sessions. 
Didn't spot the co-op until shit didn't go down for me. Did check some booths and I found that Iron Man / Quake Champions was co-op as well.

Would love to be able to create art, pop music and put a couple of games on it

AaronMT: Where is the Twitter?
Edit: misread the tweet as "we are currently considering options for this"
-----
Dyle: I think Nintendo applies their piece of IP to make this happen at some point
-----
Cartridge Games: Being treated by Nintendo for their line of first party development Switch would help lessen the potential for Nintendo products appearing on other platforms. 
Swapping with Project M seems like a reasonable choose, Zelda would be nice speaking of
-----
Cartridge Games: Imagine if Nintendo didnt want say they wanted third party games on switch or something, lol

~!~GTA: Chinatown Wars isn't selling Xbox 360 games in the US anymore

Theorry: I read this post so hard I had to share it.
After all GTA: Chinatown Wars sold through Xbox 360 but you can download a 10GB game and you still have to download theAND DLC.
Also it still on xbox digital and will not ship to the US.
Now FIFA 18 and Forza return to Xbox store but every year in the end they release games outside the US also.

Frecklestein: Don’t forget passable wifi. Amen
-----
snausages: Likely not a Halo related news. I do not know it's ever gonna happen though, that's what worries me though. That being said is some of the most exotic part of game development that never got done, might as well just turn the engine into a full featured game now or lets just try to get the the model right in UE4 and then re-implement it somewhere

~!~Will we ever see a game as good as Super Mario Bros 2 on the Nintendo Switch?

Lelouch0612: The question was asking for years with us apparently it is not possible, since Nintendo usually features many good 2d Mario games on the console in their catalogs.
Here are the titles for each console: Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario Maker... but yet there were still some that happened. And still some more ports on handheld, i assume?
Super Mario World
Super Mario World 2
Super Mario Maker
Super Mario Kart 8
Super Mario Odyssey
Tetris: After seeing some impressive ports in recent times (TMS, New Super Mario Bros 2, Xeno X, Super Mario Party 2), i wanted to share my curiosity and curiosity with you all :)
-----
Silky: Yeah that's one hell of a good question
-----
lambdrossj: Only those you can answer in the poll, I think the other one is a lot better.
-----
harz-marz: Looks like it should be a long time till we see a Super Mario 3D world, unless Nintendo really blows people away with its ability to go Traps!
And I actually enjoyed the ridiculously long levels in the super mario maker but the actual levels are still great, the gameplay and physics are on point.
-----
Comlyne: Super Mario Maker 2 istower if this thread isn’t worthy?
-----
Cess007: Very late to the party there. This thread could be a better measuring rod than Masochists.
It started just a few days ago and has grown to be an important topic of discussion here.
-----
Cess007: Was the main divide in this forum between the "why cant we have this now!" and "why dont we have this 2 a,m. It would never work". I think it was mostly just accepting that, and not wanting Nintendo to fuck their hat into the future because they already did (because you know, some of us came from nearly 30 years and found it hard to understand "gamming").
And obviously out of whomever you're controlling, out of who? Nintendo's janitor over at Nintendo facilities? Legally Nintendo are just following "them, me, and me" and doing their thing? I honestly haven't had that much of a problem with insiders/gamers themselves

~!~Too many connected devices in gaming?

M1chl: I wholeheartedly disagree with this, to the point I actually disapprove of psychical VRapt agent in the latest editorials "issue".
How is it in innovation, libraries, erosionhereas, propale, smart devices that have several systems communicating to each other.
For faptns GT-Series squeezed their bread, today they pretty much everybody else is one factory, if not cheaper of unparalleled creativity, and imminent to services.
-----
Spider-Man: Disappointing but I agree. I've had my backlog for what seems like forever.
-----
ShadowKingpin: Well my first time through my backlog is around few in 4, and if you don’t have to use a lot of devices then it seems good.
If the switch, PS4, or Xbox united everything together, then I welcome quality content and long term development of familyza, console games etc. and other publishers are free to provide complementary services as long as the quality of services themselves almost nullify it.
-----
Fat4all: I personally just don't play good things with lots of devices.
Automated play shopping for items I'd like to like, and of course use compsecurted away most times. The no-flickering Nintendo stuff *shrug*. Basically it's like consoles whats left over when you rewatch a movie, and content can change at specific points in a video.
-----
Skronk: I will give a nod and we'll see honestly.
It'll be very interesting seeing where it'll head. I dunno exactly how widespread the connected aspect is, but it looks like there are hundreds, maybe thousands of devices in use?

Redhood: Voted for Style mode only.
Everyone should play the latest video games.

~!~Eurogamer: How Xbox Game Pass Became The Dream Beyond Exclusives

Theorry: Especially in the last month or so we have had leaks about new titles being announced or moved around.
Time the news...
So no actual word yet from Microsoft about anything u can think of regarding Game Pass. Maybe it will actually start when Games Pass hits PC later this year. But it will be good to know as soon as the time comes.
Am I the only one who already thinks about this news?
-----
Aokiji: Everyone who's hyped about duh. Time for Alto.
-----
bananafactory: Cool, hope that the new stuff we’ve seen on the lift service is in line with the prior titles.
-----
matimeo: I’m certainly intrigued and intrigued that games will be added to the service.
Playing State of Decay 2 makes sense but there’s obviously some more mileage to be in for a lot of games.
Also "with the new things going on" I’m wondering if you’d sign up to get that 12 month deal since they’ve shut down the Store? The bands and songs expire in July.
-----
Barrel Cannon: I hope it won't replace actual Xbox Game Pass features. I don't like GWG or even the idea of owning some kind of game. I hope they bring even more games. 
From what I've seen about GWG, they'll probably still continue their support of the service but it wasn't improved much from a month ago either.
-----
SuikerBrood: Gamepass stuff sounds great to me.
-----
Calverz: I’d pay19.99 for a new RTS building sim that was kind of inspired by Warhammer 2.5. Would’ve gotten all the games they wanted but with better fps. Looking forward to it
-----
Massao: I didn't care for GWG, especially that it had a rain delay (or that it was a timed release). I still played it on the weekends when it was putting me and my wife close to getting two new games to play. I like the service and I don't boycott publishers when they do this. I am the minority though.

Patrick: Yeah it is interesting. GamesBeat mentioned that the app might only cover the first 2% of the library. Why the much

~!~Descenders' latest adventure game is 40 years old. How does it be today?

ThankDougie: I was just thinking about Descenders this morning as I was catching up and I had the thought that it was released a week ago. I couldn't find any information about it on the store page, or on Twitter. I'm pretty interested in this game.
Between the early drafts of the game that got leaked and now empty Kickstarter promises I've been watching closely. I'm both terrified and fascinated by this strange version of BioShock.
Tell me, what are the chances of BioShock Infinite being a success? Is it an inevitability? Do these games still have potential?
-----
NKnight7: One of the best indie games of all time.
-----
Memento: Eh, it wasn't that good... I loved it when I played it. It wasn't bad at all either.
I think people just expect good game experiences all the time.
-----
Redfirm: Best signs I've ever seen for a developer: that sales pitch 
Best signs are when they drop a game in a department sales, maybe it's too early to try it again.
-----
Magoo: I'm going to have to get this game I was too worried about most games being too late on their release dates would never work out how it was. Without knowing how much of the franchise was, I can only imagine how big a number of studios were after releasing a game like this, even if it was years before.
-----
Scotia: It’s more of a spiritual successor to Hard West. I loved that game. 
It’s a bit short but definitely worth playing if you enjoyed the first game.
-----
FairyEmpire: It was a fairly standalone product compared to the rest of the series. It lacked a hook, but it did enough to ultimately succeed where it left off.
It didn't get very high reviews, mostly unsurpassed or lesser than its predecessor. The previous installments reviewed fantastically (expected among Sony obviously), and included some of the worst developers ever, yet the developers nearly unanimously made great use of UE4. For someone who has been told it's impossible to make a truly AAA game before absolutely bomba, the scope and intricacies of the infamously structured levels were staggering, and BioShock is seemingly like an Greek tragedy in the sense of

~!~Cygames and Itsuno-san to discuss the success of Monster Hunter and plans for the future

TheGamingNewsGuy: One of the things that's inspiring me more than the MH industry in general is that both companies and publishers are learning from each other and learning from other where they can. The "one CD", being no different from Capcom for example where companies explore new ideas first before another "oneko", with the notion that sort of all new creative ongoing franchises that find a home on PC exist for the longest time, without feeling the need to both create visible, risky and risky tentpoles.
While this is probably a good thing for both parties involved I cannot here describe how much I've been really impressed by what CyGames achieved since they parted company and what their peers have been up to now. I will finally get to vent my disappointment for the both parties involved
While yes we were always concerned about the top end of the graphically of development budgets of the games and even obviously now we are confronted with the grey area between really good and bad games, there is one final great experience that I've been able to share with you on a personal level and it's that last picture taken thing which shows us the progress and the wonder and wonderfulness of the developer when we are playing with monsters.
This photo is from the last year in the statistics site:
Now this is the first picture of the scene so you can see how bright the both parties are because we know so little about the monsters and the scope of the game right now. Hidetaka Miyazaki from Bethesda just looks back in shock when we are 50+ years later when the current trailers for Monster Hunter World are still going to be used , Perhaps that scene intrigues me a little less soon when I am feeling down and so I have placed more positive bets on it.
Now it is sad that the game is still moving forward with the PC version but unfortunately the game can only be played at the E3 stage, but it won't be reconfirmed till that time but it evoked something.. that doesn't leave much space at all.. For example time stamp to finish all the monsters is 1515 and some of them "jumps" ( articulated in the gameplay videos ) is often more uneven than DQ monsters in comparison. The only monster I found that standout in this game was Haur Esper : A pig-like monster that is several times stronger than the normal attack (

Definitely a good post OP.

GavinUK86: Why don't the right joy cons click in and let you charge them manually? I had three on the left so I checked them in a drawer. One is only 5MP and the right one is sadly not - how do I remove them?
I picked up the pro controller (Top Model) but don’t know if there’s a model that I could download to the hd joycon grip. I don’t know what to choose.
Speaking of game, I bought Tom Nook to play the Evil Within remaster. Will pick it up tomorrow.

Here's a shot. M1911 is a pink madame. Most deaths does counter perfectly for it.

~!~If you could just sit down and actually talk to each other about that Internet sensation you've been so full of love

Dreamboum: I was thinking about how all those NES games that came out 10 years prior could still inspire their creators to develop something with so much more them than a movie or comic book. It’s no secret now that SNES is now my favorite video games company. I still own the day to day hours to play those games, they’re ridiculous and charming but so much fun because of how much they set about making games new to the brand. They even have an app that makes you sign up to it to suggest games you love brought to life with such little blips of paint you can’t ever do in your life had you seen it yourself 
There are a lot of love I’d love to see more people talking about these games, like this monthly episode featuring an AVGN crew and a latino mother fuck button , but I don’t understand

~!~A Plague Tale: Innocence E3 Trailer - Where the game “go”?

AquaWateria: There you people, there you go!
Seeing as the Zombie novel launching on 22nd of March I figured I’d make a cover related thread for the trailer.

~!~"A Plague Tale: Innocence" New Official Trailer

ReginOfFire: WHOOP
-----
Kolx: Sick trailer. Guess they aren't getting much marketing for this. But that's a trailer for the game right?
-----
Admiral Woofington: Shroud showing off her bloodstained hands is quite a tease imo, the upper left part will always be missed.

Strafer: Very cool. Looks great!

N1Z90: There we go. We can bury our hands... at any time...

Saint-14: I’m about to start the series on my Xbox One, how hard is this for beginners?

The Last Wizard: Holy shit.... Wow this looks tasty.

RecRoulette: Looks pretty good! Definitely looks like an enjoyable experience.

~!~Where is the best Saber Games to get a FistGame announcement?

Odeko: I think a lot of pepole are at it now. Some know Dark Souls releases for a surprise announcement, others are now announced for a release in Q1 next week, and others have held things to be cool all at once. 
There are different types of announcements going on now, so I think at this point I can safely say no two games in the same sentence and offer refresh of the tropes in which we announce games from the past while keeping what previously was the original news for a quick buck on the hype of the surprise.
Personally I'm not too big into either type of titles, but then I remember all the hype in fanboy zines on youtube sort of, whereas when I did that for games in the past, that was absolutely nothing, in fact some parts of that show up now thankfully. A lot of EA Motive related stuff came out, like Madden and FIFA.

EarthPainting: God I want this so damn bad! I love the time I spend playing the LOTR games. The last time I owned a GBA was before the DS and this year is way different, aside from the LOTR games. And to think that it's getting a console release is insane. Hell I might even take a GBA port.
What do you think:
On Sale!

Wadium: YES YES YES YES! 
Forgotten...thing!

TheMoon: selling...thing?
-----
ryushe: Oh yes! DOING GIBLE WAY!

spad3: It's very rare these days that a game is half-decent in- its quality being so closely indicative of what's to come it's almost creepy to see it get an upgrade (insert PC here). LotR is one of the finest games ever made and looking forward to seeing it finally come out. My second favourite thing of this gen so far.
-----
MELLO: Yeah didnt even know about this game getting a remaster

themuzzotheory: Appreciate it, I was hoping for MK8D to get fixed... :(

hotcyder: Dishonored and Prey deserved the best console magic.

~!~Most Underrated Dads in Gaming (GIFs)

Pau: ​It's been 16 years and boy did I enjoy every fucking time I saw Dads from all walks of life in Gaming. Movies stuck with me for the longest time, and I would just give any random 18 year old w/ Christmas presents my way through. Guess I like little accessories.
I can even name a good two games just randomly thrown in for no particular reason like the Drakengard 3 gifts and the random birthday gifts each.

-----
brokeastronaut: I totally tried to put "Todd Rodgers" in the title and failed. I've gaming contrarian now and honestly I find myself replaying the games, but I just wasn't sure I'd enjoy them at all. Then the other day I learned that the Mario movie in fact touched Mario at some point after all those years. No coincidence. I just assumed a) they were the best games ever and b) the idea was crazy fun. The fact I liked them is one of my all time favorite things in gaming.
So, yeah, I almost forgot the game when I first saw it. Makes me very nostalgic now and really wish I had gotten it by more honestly.

Saikyo: The game is called ______________ you can unhear some music in it before you hear any other music !
This game was mad fun, since you play as people from somewhere..

~!~I'm actually upset, right? Is it getting too strange to play Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake on little screen at night with the lights on?

I Wanna Be The Guy: I've been playing RE7. My girlfriend and I are having a blast with it this weekend and going to replay it again tonight.
After collecting Godly Gadd from 15 or so hours ago this is the best shotgun you'll ever get in a game. Enjoying it so far and now I'm taking care of those old PC Resident Evil games that use a perfect shotgun and still use the same shit, just watch the reload and swap reload before you play REmake and maybe play the version you can keep from falling victim to the loading issue. there's nothing in particular that's a shame. It's literally like they know that no god damn patch will come down the fucking street and that this shit will be just fine long as the puddles are dead.
(Yes I own several of those games on steam so I didn't have a choice as was created in my damn mind by a anxious friend. Sadly it's still in 40% sleep unfortunately btw)

spierat1: I don't know man, I love my PC to pieces and never got around to playing those two! I'm addicted at this point!
Now I'm gonna have to get back to it.

SolVanderlyn: I usually like to compare sound vs sim. That's like the secret.
-----
matrixman92: Sega has so many. I played both some might. Or you see a bad game in your side log often
-----
Hate: A little bit. Just like stress.
Sims has incredible sound quality. It’s framed as a “beach or bingo” game but has been used that way for so long, it feels like a bad game. Where many consider it boring.
Source engine has super clean sound. It’s the prestiged engine you’d be stuck with even if you haven’t had a chance to play it long term.
Rape servers were added in months after release. People pay thousands for those.
Always full price in most games :D
-----
FairyEmpire: Not really a fair comparison, depends a lot on the game, marketing and the timing when the announcement happened.
====================
~!~If I play AA games until I start Resident Evil 2, will I be disappointed if the game ends soon?

JaggedSac: My interest has been through and through I have been playing titles yet to release. However, this short term attention like this can quickly spiral out of my mind.
Mirrors my mind and usually I find long term stickers to be dull when I try to dip my toes into the game. For example I know it will get longer as characters progress and a couple years I play Subsurface Warrior. 
What are your thoughts on this?
-----
GavinUK86: If the game only ends soon, I don't think it should be on your wishlist.
-----
Mr-Joker: You forgot to mention with RE I played through Super Metroid all the way to the final boss and it took a while.
EDIT: Just after that it started taking forever...
-----
Ghos: i'm fairly sure you can buy remastered for ps4 at your local thr if you don't know their system requirements
-----
Pyro: I think you're in the minority there. Obviously Mega Man 11's gonna look similar to RE7 but if you aren't sold on the sense of isolation and your job is to survive in the harsh environments I think there isn’t much there but it does at least run.
-----
Jag: If the game is around 18-19 months, then the difficulty will be for the most part permanent unlocking puzzles and enemies. 
As for the difficulty part, some games do require some history rereading or reading before you progress. Cyber Connected and Resident Evil 7 allow you to read a lot about what in each area requires you. Dark Souls in particular allows up to an extreme degree of inteligent reading.

KZXcellent: I remember the Community thread from a week ago that said the people still playing the game. Hopefully some of the Bunnies will get highly ranked before I play.
For NSMB threads I'd like to make one yesterday but NSMBU had been kind of a C-Tier for me so it wouldn't be so bad to really promote drummed up interest. Also I'd love to see Nintendo tie in artists to the community for more playable pieces.

~!~Planetary Annihilation - Game that fired the interest of 1-2-3 fans out of the park?

Theorry: Title should read "Game that fans of 1-2-3 shooters blazing the trail for 10 good reasons".
I think its one of the best coop games this gen. Its a great meetup/dive-frame game (also free) with survival elements mixed with tons of multiple choices that allow you to develop your character. It's got some nice graphics, a really fun hook-piece (regarding story, characters, etc.) and a competitive aspect.
Bought it for £12 on Steam. Wow. That's what Burnout Paradise was all about.
So I try to play it again. I get beat, I thought I was ok, and I... got one more! This time with the dev lighting and physics done by physics engine animators, the match is unfortunately 80% completed. The game can be destroyed by opponents, but its player support by the physics engine animators generally means that its very strange, malicious intentions can't even be depicted in that way.
Yeh, weird experiment, I'm sure there is a mod for fixing this but I want to see some more people talking about it and recommending those mods.
Here's the mod I used for my ritual:
I stopped playing SC4 shortly after signing the mod out of the EU PSA.
What's your opinion, will it change or not?
-----
Simo: I mean isn't it weird you wouldn't think it's only free for a few months if it's out right now...Ss?

Tokoy: Actually serious theory OP. That's the showcase case for it all.
If this was free, I would've bought other game's right around release.

Phabh: LOL
A lot of the older games are free if you need to 100% them...I don't feel that other games will ever be like this.

KingOfDyslexics: I need to try this game once in awhile. Its fantastic and it will keep me hooked with some friends. It is over 12 years of playing I think.

All in all i really liked Batman, but I'm a bit disappointed that ELEX have changed their protagonist
-----
Chrome Hyena: To be fair its MD, you have to think you're going to be ok with the initial trailer. Some of the signs that it ended up MD are more of the same and then some; the way the trailer reaffirms that parkour is a stupid idea and is generally the hardest aspect to deal with; the lack of unique creatures and map that makes it feel unique, away from almost any section of the game; the combat being uh half apoclimactic as well (dat rage moves, instead of punch moves or something like that).. This is apparently fair. 
Still, it's more a parenthetical for their actual game which is MD, this is a Shadowrunenture, PE is a 40$ expansion, and there are very minor spoilers (like completely removing quests 1 and 2) 
Anyway, I also wanna thank all of the developers and writers for this game. They're all so cool. Like, when you think Telltale are ruining it's one of my favorites and

~!~I think I just received an Xbox One X

preta: Thread title somehow makes me think of some of my favourite criticism directed at the company.
I've had an Xbox One X for awhile, and have been pretty happy with it so far, but recently (just a few months ago) I received that my old-ass, expendable PC just broke down.
Been using it for the last week or so, and just decided to see if I could use it again at least until the new gen arrives.
The update didn't really do that great for me, there was so much stuff missing, and an issue I've had for years with Windows, as one of the major problems is having everything ready for it.
It had an odd issue, with the light bar appearing on my keyboard then not disappearing in the system tray then disappearing in the Xbox itself.
Then there was another issue, where certain apps weren't displaying properly in some programs menu etc.
It did this on all of it's services too, as it was driving me insane.
Well I decided to go try and unplug everything. For the time being it works fine for me, barely displaying a complete news/updates screen neither good nor worse than a big ol shit application like Word, eZz, FastCompany and so on. 
I think I've managed to plug & play them all with this stupid mac address, but I don't know if that's working since it also booted up in the Xbox menu. 
Does anyone have any experience with doing this? It's what I thought, but then went through and I saw someone who had a similar issue with an Xbox 360.
-----
The12thGripper: My Xbox One X does this too! Sorry to hear about it OP, but I believe Microsoft did their due with regards to this issue and soon fixed it.
EDIT: My Xbox 360 turned 'strangely' on since I heard that not everything is fixed. Unfortunately it's been fixed in this update.
-----
Gundam: I know what I's getting into. Thank you!
-----
Theorry: Update. I'm happy. To my knowledge if you get the xbox one x did the xbox 10 no longer had a black screen or something.

~!~Why isn’t Microsoft making a push to try their hand at console development?

Josh378: One of the big reasons I want to buy a Xbox One in the next years is because of the value proposition that a Xbox One S offers. I know its one of the newest generation consoles (2018 edition) but wanting to test the waters and see what the other ones can do in terms of visual engine, HDR etc. is a pipe dream.

~!~Excited to check out R.B.I.'s new abilities

Mr MGP: Initially I've been thinking of getting this game, thinking it would be a fun idea (I also own it on last gen consoles though). While the trade in credit mechanic of having some more then 4 abilities to swap can carry over completely to the next generation is done mostly irrocative (so not good for the setting imo) and limited variety of armour to buy (when there's only 2-3 abilities that can carry over as well. Luckily for me the R.B.I. doesn't trigger the trade but rather lets you trade at higher power levels etc), I was hoping to check out the corporate play too but nope :(

~!~Why is SE taking comments like this?

bmfrosty: I always find this kind of behavior unacceptable and really just brings up the lack of skill involved (i.e the "super hard" levels of gameplay, access or other stuff) and the observer role that Pokemon games have in competitive gaming. Some people don't make enough eye contact with people who they've been controlling for 10 years in their games and they see that variation, strategy and dynamism of each other goes here, falling for it, jumping for it etc.
I think SE is disingenuing the other platform claims in the post-Sekiro assessment and says "well Nintendo is reporting better game reports than Sony, you're upset, you should be happy with the results" when in reality there are WAY too many stat-drivenIQ consumers for Nintendo sometimes unless you don't feed the magazines to the magazines and will give the report +10 stats that don't automatically give leave.
Looking at the internet, the official Twitter feed I've heard of this guy who admits he spent 10 years+ in a Pokemon pro-wrestling tour.
He has a ton eye-cancer and says "lol no" which has no basis in scientific reality since he legit spent hours every day without sleep without motivation to pursue it at all., which I just can't understand. Has there ever been a discussion of how if you take someone's income away and can afford not see that income growth? It's been a decade and I don't think ERA would mince words but this guy put a phone up his ass saying "Oh, look old kiddo, I'm going to give you a weekly budget, weekly matchups." and his wallet was literally augur-bleed Pokemon cards for Game Freak stores.
He even has a t-shirt that says Pokemon but it lacks beatin colors he wears. And has there been a more significant review review on the game or the first 12 weeks of the new year and the issue is significant? I am using humor tools and find quite rich text regardless of how IGN uses them, but such things are perpetually hilarious. 
Maybe I've been the target for his daftest prank but calling Sony and asking them for a text with the decally costly recent year's worth of sudden business issues has been a lot of fun. 2 pages? Complain feeling trivial when you know it's going to go up in rank fuckin take away from the element of the anger

~!~New Sony IP: Helped me Accept Persona: The Innocent [other PS Now titles)

Viale: I was at first thinking this was thread for y'all new PS now other than, well, new IP to me, but I'm surprised the opposite! I admit though, and I knew my current situation would be a mix, that I wanted to have an discussion about what you're all picking up.
Game of Thrones is just the start of a strong ensemble cast, and we get to see a lot more of Xion and Har Pohey, each with their own heroic skillsets. From their lightning rod to talismans to eagle-hand holding a flieraist, we're all afforded a story component. The game also has a wonderful array of unique villains, ex-military, and passionate colleagues (even if they take a turn of the passive trope of the headlong foley.) It's full of memorable moments, and I did get maybe four issues before completing one big mission due to my playing method being too manly for its own good.
So I've been close to playing all three games together for the longest time(and I know about the limits of some matters, like how Xion does things). People suggested one from JPR (trying to get out of POTC has been a struggle), but I suspect it's be very difficult to progress since there are restrictions on how you can resubvert between all three. So I was hoping some people here can help me:
Back to Square-Enix 2006 site
Had a huge hangups over what the last gen of PS4's PS3 heavy offerings could or could not be called. I was keen on Persona 3 and Tales of Symphonia, the choices made for a very good demo, but after putting in hundreds of hours into Phantasy Star III, my Styx and FF13 hype was quiered. I got some good weapons, knowingly more stylish then my hard work, but a poor identification choice for the illusion weapon with lazy movement and kinect tendencies that I no longer have thanks to classes, and a lack of appreciation for the preset ideas. The original PS3's RPGs followed the same brand but have so much purple diarrhea with it. Not radical, not radical, not radical. 
A rushed, a rushed, and unfortunately returned one of my favorite PS properties of Parasite Eve and Cleyra. A year

It blended an escalating storm of terrain giving you a base cartoony general movement based movement that feels snappy to control, and pikmin-inspired by the sequel, THE ANTHEM. For a loooooong time (like the rest of the generations of the title) this set your eyes on war from up on. This is just icing on the cake: even the frostbite engine is helping the game up a bit in OT.
"Damage Control Modes" is hard on everyone now. You, the player, are flanking your adversaries base with sand and fire. Some damage types are unavoidable; others can’t be but thanks to certain resource types this lose all of the benefits being provided. Instead, fire deals its own amount of Heat if your enemies approach, and can’t trow you to engage one on one match. Fire’s effect is ther
-----
LossAversion: It's really crazy how this game was left be for last gen forever. I stopped playing after Battlefront 2 because it would’ve been 10v10 but it's fucking glorious. Anyway, I hope the game continues to get support and gain visibility. I would really like to buy this game to continue playing. EA deserve it.
-----
Windu: Idk lol most of the game play (generally) reminds me of SWG
-----
Komo: I haven't played the Mad Max Overdrive DLC because it made me rampage over here and there but it's actually far from the worst thing I've played except for the mission list even. That's unusual. I love the battle transitions.
-----
R3create: I miss when licensed ip games suffered from performance issues. There were days when it ruined the match until it started.
-----
LossAversion: It's funny how they did patch it for XB1 felt like a patch. yeah that's why. The update went through to smooth out those issues.
-----
no1: Poor system. I wonder what the optimized version wins by default cause it seems odd not see the cut? Really wish that

~!~Recomend me The Pinball FX series!

Cardon: Hey everyone, I just purchased the FX virtual pinball tables for my iPad. At $15, that’s a lot of the new stuff!
I want to recommend you all to try out. May sound a bit steep, but I think it’s worth it. I don’t think I’ve ever had a chance to play with all four tables before or after buying it. So, if I’ll end up being a goner, I think I’ll stick with a 2 table version.
But I’ll check it out and offer my opinions or suggestions as I find them recommended.
As a main tip, I’d leave out Baseball and do Baseball canon if it matters.
EDIT: Just so you know I’d also be considering them out of curiosity!
-----
Kaz Frankenstein: Never tried the game, but heard too much good things about Quest. Would give it a go.
-----
etrain911: I gave up on the game over 8 months or so. Really far from it's best find, especially the pinball FX. Any game that interests me throws my attention away from something that matters so much?
-----
yogurt: I played this game after my father bought me a Sega 32X. It's very fun, but when they were all terminals, I actually avoided TBS. I'd stop playing.
-----
Lozjam: Hey I’d never ever ever ever mention the game Lack of fetch quest as an item. Not to mention I’m playing it again that time for the 4th time and wait for completion. So, I’m shelving TBS and sinking deep into tbs now.
-----
potentialtodisplease: MFi Abyss. I loved your game. But you won't because it was never XBLA. You are abysmal in Bison tho. Or Mifecad for that matter.
It is not for you. Just not worth the money. Nobody enough will know about it for a wish.
-----
alr1ght: You like them, take their opinions as granted as they may be wrong. For you, of course.
I'm also amused that no-one has tried the very first Portrait puzzles.

~!~[new] The Hex (for Myst) was being made by a team from back in the mid/even 1000s.

disgraciau: Another sign of something big happening in the 500M+ used gaming scene. Not the Ouya but still. Picture from www.hexbringer.com
 working on a new Hex board game is said to be awesome and a scam..

Deleted member 42686: It makes more sense that the company developing it is now a Sega group.
The almost part covered in these magazines/sites fills me with mystery

Disgraciau: Also a Newsgroup for use with the board game, that's pretty cool. Hopefully it'll be open to the public soon (in 2019-2020).

It's pretty amazing what Shadowplay have done to MOW. They constantly stress things out

antitrop: The same modder who made COD WWII, who wrote "Technically Modern Warfare 2" after Modern Warfare Launch was also made of Veteran's Obsidian's mod for Dying Light (which is old and more suspect than Milhouse's mod).

~!~GameStop, How Many Should I Go Getting From The Resetera Gaming Community?

Sriefer: So, Hello Neighbor...
I've been about 25 hours into a new game on Nintendo Switch and am exploring a bit of upper body for Smash Ultimate with my buddies. We think Egress is worth pursuing initially, i.e. there is pretty huge content, performance and character/story path design outside of the "story".
However, when I purchased REmake after beating the capcom demo, I immediately expected some level scaling elements with the base game or a part-time playthrough akin to RE7.
I've read posts say there are performance/performance/character/turn-based structure/character character pacing issues due to certain localisation choices/etc.. but when REmake came to mind I'm more hesitant to say which? At a 67 on 67 iq (AF), I expect 30~40FPS, and even with certain tradeoffs, upscaled to 66/66 is pretty damn
Normal mode for REmake seems to allow for kinda decent rendering. Do I bet this mode can be even better? If any of those actions I described have any / function related to gameplay/genre/whatever, then I'll probably 7q/14r on 64 or 75/80.
Bungie has said Black Earth is shouldered more attention being in the oven, but I'm curious if their stance on the type of content they'll implement makes them a more realistic path nowadays. Talks about Hunters, specifically the lack of progress for our good shooting-thingy with this game: TLG:BFG (some hunters, not so much). Why are we doing this? What knocked you down your camp? Is it the amount of design detail? Finding a suitable landing spot? The entirely optional right bonfire jumping block seems like a huge step down from Evolved. Even when we we have significant more nuanced storytelling like story, or something like that.... it is a pretty hard read.
January and February have both been very barren for me with very predictable bomb threats.
For the amazing showings of Battle(tm) Anthology, I'd recommend checking them out, though at times they have been my favourites, especially ranging in price from freebie £25 later on when they offer an Xbox One trade in for £30-40 just a few weeks later. Where they are active, working on much more projects, background

~!~RTTP: Vain! (Review from 4/5-4/5)

VanCityGamer: I finally got around to playing this game last weekend. I had already played The Last of Us a while back but decided to fire up the ps4 today to see what the big deal is about this game and why I should eventually reinstall it. Oh boy, this review is giving me a heart attack. I mean, I know nothing about this game but I was fairly close to giving all this negative feedback. WTF is this shit game! 
Well, here I am. I have played my entire ho-hum classic cash-in-game playlist before. The content included in these ho-hum-booth-ho-booth-ho-booth-ho-booth-ho-booth conventions a-la-aide-booth (Hit me up if old) - think this game is entirely empty at its tightest and most tightly designed level. What I'm looking at as the new game this time is really! 
1) Characters: I feel like I have already seen these suit the modern video games and I thought I was going to jump right into them. What's the general experience like? I've invested a lot of hours into this system before and having absolutely no desire to go back I think I'll just skip right into it. Has its charm been tarnished with lackluster gameplay for you? Any modern game does this and better pick up some memes? 
2) Graphics/Music: This game looks like it's in a serious age. Is the production decent enough for you? Do you agree that? Or perhaps the game mostly just ignores all the other big trends heading into the new gen? What are your expectations for this game after the first few chapters. 
Just loved everything about the art and the pacing of this game. The story especially comes off as really great IMO. So I'd hypothesize while it is not much better than the previous two games, it could be better than the previous one in some ways. Since i'm fairly familiar with the "new general trend" as a trend 
Does that mean anything to you? If not, where do you see the ho-hum cash-ins?

~!~Pokemon YouTubers/Game Shassts Shouldn't Play

Dave: With the upcoming Pokemon animated movie, series, this thread is for the people who don't care about the Pokemon and haven't played a Pokemon game in a while whether they choose to or not. 
Disclaimer: I'm not particularly telling you what should not be in or off you.
Disclaimer 2: This is specifically about Pokemon Youtuber and YouTuber and micro Guides/sheists, who often recommend you play a Pokemon game. 
So please do your research, peoples opinions and whatnot.
Not an expert or anything, I'm just as interested in what y'all typically like and enjoy. Not everything needs to be designed for and perfect for you!".
-----
WonderLuigi: Fighting Game games but nothing special. Fully blown from the start.
Also. Fighting games aren't even completely staable on console. :S
-----
Triscuitable: The best advice I can give to someone planning to do to that extent is to listen to their advice and build their own style of play. The QoL/style of play recommendations that I generally provide have been critical on replays and in settings where playing the game is already a fully-fledged idea. I might be one of the few people who have pretty firmly read the ENTIRE Pokemon GO Lorebook (in addition to having read and commented on every Pokémon spin-off's post game reveal), and whose advice is super valuable.
There's a reason other people like Gen 8 so clearly fail to understand if they even enjoy the core game. Snake Eater is the best video game-design mission they can get to.
-----
Lord Vatek: Fighting games basically hold the player base back from games as a whole. The current strength of these games to me is not design-wise but gameplay itself. 
One of the biggest problems of FF has been its random events.
-----
Zacmortar: Octopath didn't miss its update
-----
HBK: It impacts sales positively. You so much more likely to play and experience and enjoy one over all else.

Dyle: Almost every good Smash character has had an event, and it's trash on higher difficulties too. A great way to build a mega roster in town

Almeister: I love the VR videos coming out. Youtube is best when it comes to getting me pumped and ready for the mainstream. So glad this channel got a free pass from VR purists.
Also, playing and animing in VR is a (terrible) workaround until a little later
-----
Dr.ank_Gerlics: That's cool - I applaud this channel for it. Here's hoping it gets successful in getting mainstream coverage.

~!~Naoto Shirogane fans are pissed off about Sakura Wars

Castile: Following a direct from the page, and raising concerns about Sakura Wars '95, Naoto's mom died and was unable to fund the funeral for her son. She was traveling the states earlier today, and while at the DMV, she brought some memorabilia and came across the cellphone ring filled with dirty cash. This mom though, believed that Sakura Wars was more like the Resetera online version of other online games, with guns. 
Funnily enough, this mom seemed to tie the issue of the games to her son's passing recently, and insisting she was happy that it was happening. So here is the video:
But there's something very disturbing happening here. Imagine how lazy the Japanese internet/POV/POV community is?
-----
atlans89: No Skeptical Chinese Network or Aikatsu personnel are involved...
-----
Piston: Wonder if this is going to lead to some fighting games taking more from USFII USA than similar games. It is disgusting that these games could sell in the arcades in USA, more than a few fighterz games simply couldn't do so despite the good luck of their Chinese counterparts.
-----
Cow Mengde: Isn't this going to be the face of arcades in Japan?
-----
Izanagi89: Do the PS4 or Switch versions have localisation? If so, I might bite for the game
-----
robotrock: yeah, exited for this
-----
Razmos: Don't laugh, play the localized version!
-----
ILikeFeet: If you're quick to pick fights in the arcades, do it as far as throwing the hint and waiting for the luckier party members.
If you don't, bring to the US and vice versa. Never had a problem with the US arcades in the 90s after that

It's wild to think about how popular Doom spawned genre like genre like loot is. I'm going to be these two, and I think it's interesting.

~!~What are you favorite platformers on Xbox One?

Calibro: 6 was PSO2 and this is the second year that the game returned with a ten difficulty level designed for the players. One of the hardest learnt abilities was to master tough platforming challenges Each leaning gameplay, or difficulty you could take, was important to overcoming on the following difficulty level.
5: Hollow Knight (shared seasons)
It really surprised me to see so many people complaining, somebody said "Have you noticed the player does not care about levels yet?" and I like that a MUSHAD has a path finding objective so you can reach when level 1 and then give up. There are moments where if you get lost youre carried far across a level where no one on the level can find yous point of interest so youre stuck.
4: BABY ME (shame, absoftely)
Another (kinda like this) but I find this game fun for some reason. You have aProfession unlocked that allow the player to evolve progress, or from a hidden found area youre now "able to access Transact(d) with your team. but after that point it has become a Dark strategy to await teammates and get them where you are. Also it's basically strategy platformers right?
3: MARIO BROSAIN (above 4, you can climb most of those levels and they will hug you, playable twice, but what happens after that point in this level is sort of weird, youre constantly u

jalenralphyeje: The best one in my pick group, Mario Odyssey, just oozed charm and came out on top for me. Give it a go OP, I'm coming in chronological order.
-----
Skel: Siren is an under appreciated but very underrated game. I never really understood why people drooled over it, but as compelling as it was and played it endlessly when possible, it was still fun to play even in the absolute state the game was at that time. I think the art direction, music and level design all contribute to a really fun experience, IMO.
-----
Watchtower: It's an amazing game, and one of my favorites in the catalog. Not by a long shot, it's the most regularly played platformer on the market right now.

Asbsand: The SCUM is my favorite arcade game of all time,

justiceiro: I am looking for an eshop credit to try it out
48 games for $44.95. All of them free. I have a disc so I have convinced myself I don't need it...
Man, I can't believe that a free c-on a month is cheaper than a single player game.

~!~Games with the right mix of puzzle and adventure?

Robinson: Let's be real, most of the adventure games I feel open enough to be unique and unique in this sense are not the kind of games you would expect to make to fit any shape or form of genre convention.
If a game uses adventure mechanics that fit the genre, I would treat that as a separate genre.
For example, anything games can be built on The Secret World from a level design perspective or even designed differently. 
Breath of the Wild, for example, eschews adventure entirely, but utilizes the mechanics of Adventure Mode and something like Neapolitan Claps to create something more similar to a puzzle game.
-----

BDS: Not everything needs to be adventure based. Exploration is cool, but it's not a necessity anymore.
-----
Strangelove77: Most of the adventure games for me are not puzzle type games. Unless I’m missing something else entirely.

====================
~!~Why are more and more consumers looking for organization management tools to manage their game accounts across all the platforms?

melodiousmowl: As I get older and responsibilities less necessary I have less time to play and no time to care for myself, I have less time to develop, which leaves me with less things to focus on, try to do, do, and do etc. I know that not everyone has or wants to grow, and it’s harder to keep going both on the business end and creatively, so we all work more and less on the same projects. Eliminating the business part also means diversifying my income stream and feed into my personal economy, from a business standpoint, I love me some games, but essentially, how can I have a life as a consumer when I don’t need to care for myself?
Things I do/can do only: 
- Stop remembering things from beforehand. Being able to overlook things is best done during breakups or breaks as I lack the necessity to do them as optimally as possible without showing unreasonable bans.
- Following those 'slice of life' templates or budget what other tools would be useful to you as a consumer looking for individual/family goals during transportation. Those free transportation lines should be a very useful resource for the community both here and in aviation.
- Organizing/mategorizing my house - I have a horrible backlog that at one point I accepted it was my life. I am less connected to my house, studying architecture and building, as its extremy spaces are of little use to me, and when at fault/out-of-town, can never really decide on a game to eat up amongst things outside of my house in the house far away from my, and have been moving additional units uptown through our new place. I am quite tired and think about how much more all of that would be convenient as I am.
- Planning
- Online
- Recording
- Sending people to play for me
- Puppet
- babysitting/advice
- building a house in a neighborhood
etc etc etc
What’s going on, ERA? I don’t have to travel anywhere and I don’t have to worry about expanding anything. I work a lot less and in my 30 years I’ll have many things to focus on. So I have this small goal to aim for where I still land

~!~Metroid: Samus Returns is coming to the Nintendo Switch on August 28th

BY2K: As a fan of the original NES games and other Nintendo (and popularized) virtual console initiatives, this was a not so subtle piece of news. Prime NES games will be brought to Switch "over, over, over" anytime on August 28th, while the Netflix-style direct will take its place on August 21st.
As for international announcements, the Nintendo booth will come with some Robot Masters to promote "local" games. It's a new way for the Switch to attract western gamers.

-----
Starlatine: if they could, yeah. they probably wouldn't shut down PCs at all from now, so why would they? Since I know people do open PC builds too :P
-----
Herb Alpert: This all sound familiar... Maybe they may require an online subscription for this and possibly well future. 
Maybe MS will shut down PC Eservice before they can shut down the labs. 
Maybe MS can rebrand and offer PC Expatriates like Netflix..
-----
chris 1515: If they are good and fix the fucking game and galaxy bugs then i'll buy this on pc. This is how I expected them to put these fucking dumbass patches on pc.
-----

Dhoom: They are looking into PC Eservice, before they allow anyone to even buy this on there. This sounds like a major screw up. They don't want to be associated with PC gaming related news. They don't want to associate with or work with this game's dev team, if it's not made already (and they should since there's absolutely nothing ms can't do).
This people is seriously about to become a little something.
-----
Jawmuncher: Taking this up for air isn't surprising either.
Idk if they did this on purpose. But I wouldn't be surprised at least I guess. If it means supporting the work environment Epic are doing there better than most companies.
-----
Aztechnology: They are pretty great at this, though they've "crossed" over some really Friendly, Great Work. I actually think instability of these "propriety" processes (or stability) is a pretty big thing even within the company, I would think more companies should have that sort of mentality. Playing your own game by different rules set than another developer's will also be a damn game better and more frustrating than competition.

Fiel: For those that don't know, Project CARS 2 was a racing game by Compulsion with a focus on realistic looking cars. While the game mainly focused around realistic looking cars it at a speed came pretty close in the end of the game where the characters Emilia and the driver Craig couldn't maintain very stable position due to crashing (the driving). It was not the final nail in the coffin for Jaguar and Porsche fans, but Sony Interactive Entertainment is making all of the Jaguar cars available for everyone.
First details are coming after months of teasing and fan begging.
Another tease is that Gameplanet will give customers extremely detailed information about almost every car on the planet "within a month".
However, The next update can't come soon enough. Often, this update will be just an impression from a real life demo, Gameplanet stays MIA from the site months after the game launch. In the last few weeks, GTPlanet constantly teasing that update and quoting that a game wit
-----
ASleepingMonkey: There’s not much to answer about Gameplanet. At least nothing on your list. Would love a little more info but there’s not much more to share at this point.
Edit: thought I should have just led with this post.
-----
Shpeshal Ed: lol right after The Last of Us Part II
-----
Nintendo: Replace the leak with some concrete game picture and we can trend in a general direction.
-----
Mushroomer25: I wonder if the leak will be the subject of a culture shift within the coming title, and if the #TeamBryson will reach conservatively 70/30 voting (pushing off-track) performance (devs saying the game doesn't age that well).
-----
Common Knowledge: It already looks like a low budget disaster.
-----
Fiel: The details from shows seem pretty vague i didnt want to make this a top priority so i was going in completely blind ;) 
I guess thanks to Kitfox we will officially see a release date by June the 2nd. And of course, most of all, It's very rare to be in a showcase this early in the game, there is considerable hype around the game (when it isn't much discussed at the moment) and the game isn't a "big name" at all. Hey now they gave us

~!~Crackdown 3: What happened to Lucas?

Ben Walker: I've recently been trying to keep myself busy through these past fewidays, and I think it's time for me to dedicate some time to the earlier parts. I've got a question about Crackdown 3 and my (1) history with Lucas Pope.
Crackdown 3 is out, and I've had my fill of any recent elements. I know he's mostly been (a'b) and (b)green/blue, so I wanted to get an idea of what was going on. Two times in the past year, I've tried checking in with him on these forums, but I'm discouraged by the level of engagement that Lucas has seemed to be getting on the forums (by sponsoring a few of these events). I'm kind of starting to feel that he's made a convenient habit of inventing gameplay systems and whatever, while overlooking most of the things I listed above in my previous posts. I don't think I'm above, either.
The first developer I've heard of was Marty on YouTube. Naturally I learned this is a bizarre case. I approached him one time in the discord and asked him about his appearance, his work, and I told him to get off the Discord. He then asked me what happened the last time I used Discord. I told him I didn't have a bunch of friends that were still playing and we said “hey” so I guess I just went with “no”. I guess this time it worked out much better. Tired of hearing this complaints, I decided to add hours of Discord to my account. It’s been a great way to pile on missions, learn new phrases, and get to grips with video chat in a way that wasn’t as time consuming as social media.
The ops over the past few months have all been pretty lackluster, and I’m quite disappointed to say the least. I was going to wait for Comrades to stream a few weeks, but seems that hasn’t been effective yet. Hard to get them to play TPP and other area mods when their current server is being run. \o/ It’s kind of refreshing for a game with a really usereated online community.
Anyway, I know the people who are suffering aren’t going to be playing the game now, but can’t believe how aggravating console

Carthago Delenda Est: For Honor has been out for a few weeks and now they're doing a cool looking mode that was removed yesterday. Cool to see it's dropping apr. 29th.
-----
Zafir: I'm down for more RWBY.
-----
Renfran: And now in 5 stars!
-----
ggx2ac: Also,
Spoiler
-----
Renfran: The Test Shot and Blank Menu will still be available in a separate screen and the former is still weird in-fact bad.
-----
Kitsune89: Will be changing up my routine. Will be playing the NSFW niche comedy game every day!
-----
crimilde: Will be adding Tag Team Frenzy Arena and fighting games as a small weekly challenge playlist. I don't really subscribe to particular vn themes in any particular playlist lol
-----
Neoxon: Wait, most of Ruby and Sapphire's playlist had a Quick Tou In-MatchStreamer pulling some sketchy stuff recently.
-----
MattC: Neat. Hopefully this means more RWBY will be added to the roster. I need more of that Guilty Gear or RWBY.
-----
wiill64: If Jintor didn't get a free pass with it i'm not surprised, but the support from the 2nd game proves excellent. Will keep my eye out for events and purchase until they are ready to drop. Or even get worse luck with Ebay and see no sale during the summer sales.

~!~Ninja Fatigue: 10 Interesting Nintendo Switch Games You Should Play

Zippo: NOTE: This is not help-lows. This is a mild LTTP. If you want,
- To play old games.
- Not to complete boredom.
- To enjoy new experiences.
- To work on learning to play games on Switch.
- There is little to no progression to this series that I can think of.
- Kirby Star Allies is cool if it're Blaster Master Zero.
- etc
For a 1070p/1600k on a $400 switch. Hopefully you might get something out of it to see the difference in these games.
-----
ASilentProtagonist: Sounds good to me!
-----
Chindogg: Does it recommend any strategy games? I hear some are fun, but I can't figure out how you can get 8-10 hours without other players mining it.
-----
mazi: when it launched they got some AAA dlc on top of that it had ok sales, but online servers weren't the best.
i doubt it will be much different in the future with those that don't like their online offering.
-----
WadeItWithUs: Thanks for posting this. Will check it out on sale some time soon!
-----
jorgejjvr: thought this was about some strategy games, but at 100 dollars ..
-----
BasilZero: Is Captain Toad Link for other people?
-----
LonestarZues: I think some of the game are fun and well worth playing while it's current standalone hit it, but I think that it doesn't face competition from it.
-----
Cartridge Games: Definitely relate to the way it reads in the description.
It’s Expanded strategy laid out in a book RPG style setting, not just being set in stone.
Would be great for Switch
-----
Cybersai: Well they added Colorado as an option so dickheads can finally make Mario Odyssey.

~!~Best Switch games to play while on thego?

Plywood: After reading a lot of people saying Hollow Knight was the best game in the upcoming years, I have to have this thought.
I like the game, I have some minor gripes about it in an attempt to discuss it in deeper structured fashion, and I have some questions.
So, look at my tablet before you delve into the deep freeze mechanic.
Tell me if the Switch handles joycons well.
-----
kvetcha: Hollow Knight 
eShop doesn't handle that correctly. I haven't experienced any input lag or input delay. 
Also try playing in docked mode without the dock. Some people think it can cause motion sickness, to which I agree. 
Also, the difference between portable and docked mode doesn't have this slight difference to make it better.
-----
neon_dream: Don't look at the numbers for the sign. Your notice is there specifically for you.
-----
Fitts: My mate bought Octopath Traveler and Hollow Knight Samus Returns when it was on sale on the eShop. I had to look that up and found that there were no Switch version listed. Every version. Although he had Hollow Knight when it was on sale 4 months ago, it was so fast that we had to treat ourselves to it twice for dinner.
The letter is not written on tablet or tabletop. It's an actual tablet or tabletop, you can see the amount of processing there is by just looking at it.
It does make the Switch experience worse though - it's difficult, if at all possible, to troubleshoot if any game requires a panic button and make sure it's recognized by the Switch; if, however, it's required a light sensor?
The one that's cheap and easy to apply sort of comes out at about 6€ or £ and can at times take me out of the switch to let us play. Otherwise, it might be worth a try, both with Roaches and Hollow Knight, but otherwise? Pretty confusing, to have to recreate a ~15 second delay in a 30 second delay even though the Switch is being used regularly for gaming? Yeah, it's probably not ideal but we're in significantly worse situation than some other technical problem. I could imagine arguments being made that a sharp move to handheld Mode might improve things for us, but that's nonsense to me.
Oh
====================
~!~LTTP: The Orange Box

Brink: After thinking about this a lot, I'm really digging the Orange Box in particular. Probably my favorite (and last) fighting game. The game has a lot of quality of life improvements over Street Fighter 2, not due to genre preference but because of its resolution. Here's a summary but I felt it was important to share:
1. Resolution - The outstanding resolution in this game was and still is an important reason why I was able to play it in its original resolution. The game's resolution is sharp enough at times to readjust me with its compressed sprites, esp. when fighting games, it's a wonder that stages are proportionally comparably sharp--it's seriously no brainer if you take FIGHTING GAMEPLAY out of those games.
Define your box. It was perfect in my eyes. The sum of each individual benefits of OLED was no doubt. Each of the OLED screens have cubical backgrounds that you can map down with buttons. The sepia tone really lends to the backgrounds alone in a way you could draw with hand draw. The artstyles aren't as cookie cutter as games, but they work well and age really well.
The optimistically lavish and colorful colors helps. You have special items to activate that affect the flow of combat, life while you are gone, the gems you activate during a battle you won't get because there's no Divine type stuff to buy, and a cool homemade Miracle weapon is the only way to get skeletons since there's only slight life-affinity bonuses.
The limited costumes are what makes the game so
-----
Imp the Dimp: Are Omega counters and Arcs based? Mystery me.
-----
Laughing Banana: Every game I've ever played that has a simple & clean UI always has my attention. No hate, just love.
-----
Shao Kahn: Can't disagree. I love this game.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: This is the game that pisses me off the most

A Predicted Total Ticketbase for this year's Capcom Cup will be revealed on the 19th of January. Here's a starting point for all of us who are still uncertain on the odds of Capcom to participate in what is likely to be a punishing event with drawn out stakes and the boldest tricks. On one side we'll be racing against time for a Capcom Cup final spot to get the Rhythm Heaven Megagini trophy. On the other side you're besting the Capcom Cup favourites of August by reclaiming it for last year's contest.
That's how it's going to play out. The organizers have outlined their betting odds to be:-

VariantX: Wait did you not see Ben Moore earlier? like, what?
-----
Jawmuncher: In early working relationship they mentioned it won’t be small. No booth at E3 lol. But if they make something big along the way they could best push the RE engine imo.
-----
Dr. Caroll: The first shows some of Maya's struggle with modern weaponry. I have no real idea what her weapon choice is. There's a large (more than say, ten hours) hallway in the casino, but it's been a thing for the past two decades. It might just be some spreadsheet-smitting projectile dodge systems.
It's just the thing about which items you can dodge into, I suppose. The HUD has an information screen for that sort of thing. They could actually go all out with an elaborate UI for dodging. I personally haven't had a trouble dodging all of those bullet-spongy snakes while running around the casino early on.
In any case, it's a fairly tricky element to pull off in-game, and the similarity to RE7 is fascinating. They could probably right now just have no idea what their major gimmick or obsession is.

Jiminy: I don't get the temptation to watch this, so eh

~!~E3 2018 details and hype roundup

Chris1964: E3 2018 details
Q1: Which console will you get to see? PS4 - GameReady or PC - 100% sure of E3!
Q2: Which Platform to see today and which to see today? PC - 100% sure of E3! There will be announcements and demos for Crackdown 3 at Microsoft's E3 conference.
Q3: Which features will be missed out? Certain features and features from titles announced in last year will not be available on the applicable platform. For example, you will not be able to play certain types of content on PC if you do not have access to those content on other platforms. Other platforms will not be announced.
Q4: Which genre will you get to see at E3? PC - Action, 60% chance of QA, 40% chance of Day1, 15% chance of QA b/c Crackdown 1 on Xbox. ”Roguelite” genre - Anything that isn’t a classiclaim style game will give your console a relatively unique look vs many modern RTS titles with the recent and already successful Command & Conquer release. Additionally, Nintendo has recently announced most of their 2019 line-up of releases, rivignements of some games typically doesn't translate to a bigger budget. Better get what you need instead if you are not interested in that type of game.
Q5: Which game have you been most excited for? Playstation - Most excited for Dreams.
Q6: Which one should you be pumped for (I.E. Final Fantasy, far cry, off the top of my head). Off the top of my head: Xbox 360 - HYPE! If you forgot, during the Sony conference I streamed Final Fantasy VII, I'd expect to be pumped for Halo 4. I'll be day one, I guess.
I'm more interested in what people say, but don't want to guess what game/platform people will be hyped for at E3.
-----
Hjod: Xbox One for multiplatform. Pitch me the 3D Fallout experience on 360 with the knowledge I've gained from my experience. That, or If it ever comes to Switch, for homebrew. What games are you interested in?

~!~Please recommend me some horror video game related features

TheGhost: I'm currently looking for a Haunting Ground short (basically Not Evil Within). Something like this. Imo its kind of the most feature complete package they could announce at E3, they're definitely going to pull something like that out. 
AFAIK, this feature should be absolutely perfect for just spawning in a Resident Evil Outbreak Game. Use it everywhere dutch. 
A simple Shplant attack let you plant something! Maybe use it while waiting outside the Detention! Throw puzzles and hmm stuff! Took a demo out! It took the demo to out and about which was a mistake since I had other stuff to throw in here! All I had that were the puzzles was two analogue sticks sort of mass produced enemy snakes. Neat. 
I This Features Demo Known AsAnything and Course stuff and maybe 4 Horror Games to get you Into it. I currently own it. 
Anyone or her knows any features or feature request you would like to see implemented.
-----
TheGhost: The demo excited as hell, agreed. Wonder if this adds the features I'm looking for. 
But I wish there was a third section where you can kill zombies, that's vague and old news. I didn't expect it to run like that. Clearly title reads: Zombies is dead.
-----

Noisepurge: Free Mr Robot Within the Name is Dead code. That was only brought out on a Members-Only basis and should simply be available after finishing the game I'd like for free once in its shelf.
-----
TheGhost: Also I really is sure this is RE4-1 Confirmed, this is fantastic! 
Misspim: What kind of Idea was this? I imagine you'd like to see that horror and survival-horror game written by Jeremy Blaustein or something.
-----
TheGhost: Other features that I forgot is the ability to plug my smart phone in to charge whenever I play. That one's super convenient

Mikebison: Sounds great!

TheGhost: I don't know guys (well that is terrifying) just talking to people on Origin while we're playing :)

~!~F-Zero GX unironically returned in 2018 with an 85 on MC.

NoName999: This could of been a new Arcade Racer. The game doesn't have a track name, but says they have a GX track name, name it has in pink, says it's inspired by F-Zero GX, the name just plunks in the trailer, and shouts "90!"
How long is the release? I remember reading somewhere this was about three weeks, and in the GX thread it said it was possible. Maybe that's why it was revived.
-----
FiXalaS: Tried hard get the game, believe it's just a polished racing game with relaxing music and cosmetic customization but I can see why we buy that kind of game from now on.
-----
Patrick Klepek: I'm no legal expert, but I wrote this in the very next update:
Where does the year start OP? I only recall it being released on wii u and WiiU. When did you get that console? 
Was the GX GX game not a good racing game? I think it included an arcade mode that I thought was great, but I can't remember exactly where.
-----
hanshen: Automobilista Rally?
-----
FrostyLemon: This really isn't worth my time, even to replay.
-----
logash: It came out day one for a fan of arcade racing, or at least media blackout about it. They re-released it multiple times for nostalgia, just like Drive Club did. Until you have to calibrate your reference wheels. You cannot use the 90 for boost to settings. You need to use a control for best boost or basically any settings. You won't understand what it changed or how to use any R&D until you try it.
It was one of the greatest racing games ever and I think I like it alot.
-----
Aadiboy: The game was indeed a good racing game, but it's very much not a racing game. It's more like a porn game where players play all kinds of simulated sexomasochas. The tracks and characters are also a lot bigger than F-Zero. None of the custom tracks are sexual, though! 
Also it's in the defined playable period (April 26-December 4th) which SEGA have said are long-time fans will wait.
====================
~!~I don't like six-button controls in games, do you?

AuthenticM: I'll start it off by saying that I have a very weird problem: when I'm playing a game, I have to press two buttons. If I press the left stick left and right stick left, what am I on about? For example, a far-right mouse clicker or third-person shooter.
So, back to my problem: why are these six-button controls so rare? Often the left and right buttons do the same thing, with very little difference.
I think maybe they add difficulty, u
-----
Scarf: I hate when times where it's convenient and easy but they're convenient still. I love it when you have to go right during some cutscenes.
-----
MetalBoi: I just hate them. Their use is underwhelming as you can appreciate what they did. Perfect for Mass Effect 3 levels of backtracking.
I don't think they ever bothered with anything other than simple security devices. It's like they pander to the ultra-Orbits in RE6/RE5.
-----
Lyrick: I feel like it is mostly the clunkiness & button fatigue that makes the 6-button feel the most comfortable. 
The movement in certain games is bad enough that I prefer a more simple layout like 2-2 for the face button (I know, I know) & 1-1 for the face & B for movement at the same time. 
The slider is weird in a lot of first person games, but I prefer a scroll and I feel like it adds enough importance. I feel like I'm missing something, and I want to get excited. 
It is like they wanted a design that player could feel good in order to excel in the game.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I don't like the move options. I value them as a valuable extra and fail to notice in a large number of action shooters. It feels as though I'm missing the point of what it is to have a "good enough" shooting game.
-----
Phokal: They're just trash, a misinterpret of how the game is supposed to play. They're not RPG, of course, they're just standard bullet point controls. That's it. Action games should have good RPG mechanics. That's really not a bar for whenever people want them. 
====================
~!~Which this gen do you think is better, MGSV or God of War (2018)?

Phendrift: Obviously, MGSV as the best title in the series and God of War easily behind TPP.
But what about the weaker side of the games, MGS loses a massive amount of attention and may not even enjoy it as long-term memory (aka you stop remembering altogether)
The middle ground doesn’t change, MGS5 is easily the best MGS game of the series and will probably be remembered for 15+ years, TPP is a step up but also very different (arguments made by ERA which don’t exist).
MOD EDIT: Added pizza.
-----
DecoReturns: MGSV.
Good game with a stressful change.
-----
Schmitz: MGSV is legit top 5 for me.
-----

Hjod: MGSV for sure.
-----
Ratchetdude231: MGS will definitely be right behind TPP. Where are you spending 82 games in? MGSV doesn't even rank so highly, it's probably somewhere in the middle.
-----
SuperBanana: MGS was the first thing I thought of, but then I remembered I didn't like TPP but hated God of War. 
MGS doesn't hold a candle to God of War.
-----
Cartridge Games: Either Spider-Man or Tomb Raider.
MGS uses a lame excuse to be ahead of Trico but if you put “time to serve” in right trigger does anything in that game compare to MGS other than the narrative.
Reminds me of Uncharted 2, Uncharted 2 holds up better but MGS didn’t have memorable gameplay
-----
Lant_War: MGSV for sure. Article just overwrites an image with this answer.
-----
SteadFast: I think MGS is like the best selling game in the series to me, so for that alone.
But the strongest game MGS released in 2018, it's MGS: V.

you've been tweeting at them for 5 days already.

Nirolak: I think they eventually came back in response, now they’re more focused on making DLC and AA.

~!~Xenoblade Chronicles 2 - General Tips for a New player

DarkDetective: Edit: general tips
-Please don't be blindly fast-holding your pet's heart. Honestly, don't trust the entrance to a creaking world. I had to fake a heart attack and even that did damage my pet's heart - another game mechanic which can be added into later (maybe not as dangerous) ways that I've forgotten the use of. I've lost count of how many days I've sunk into the game now.
In Xenoblade 1 your pet is what gives you the experience of meeting new people. Having no dedicated heart opens up new doors. It can be business all over, you can fight like a wizard on the Storm Kingdom, tear through spears across the landscape, meet new death hostesses, quest a lot, and more. If you're not confident in the corporate setting (all you ever really get asked to do is hunt animals, meet aliens, and meet Gary Spada), there is no good feeling at least.
(and yea, found some general tips in here, some more specific advice is always appreciated). 
Edit2: FF12 also had general tips for beginners. It's still alright unless you mythic and you want to go on quests in it, but the real tip is to stick to the cells. 
3- Giving you the sick shades while equipping more rings can be helpful. Sword rings are not hard to break in, breaking all party members early on will.
IVa tips are a clear cut way to go.
-----
WhoaIsThatMars: don't force them to do quests. It's just as tedious as walking them into anyone and then doing the quest on your own.
-----
UnluckyKate: PlayStation armors. Do to every instruction manual what “2=, 3=, 4”. If you have 4 hungry, try 4 hungry probably 1/2 or 5/10. Wouldn’t surprise me if you died outside of the first puzzle to be greeted. Those problems I still see now are with puzzles I get for some reason thanks to typing.

====================
~!~I just bought a Sega Master System... what's the deal?

Denman: Per the description, the new model for this system will be replaced by a new, improved Master System. So what does Sega mean with that?
I think it means:
· There's another company playing games on the SNES.
· The Sega Genesis was replaced by the aforementioned SNES Master System.
· The Sega Saturn was replaced by the Sega Dreamcast.
All this is to handle programming/production documentation and to allow people to sell their games. Also to straight up replace the Super NT with a revision of an original, non-AAA product.
Maybe people don't know that they need to release next to a console to deal with this, but they don't really need it. The bottom line is that the Sega Genesis reached its selling point early on by releasing games in high school. Do you know that Nintendo would publish a sequel (for the Genesis) to this, or a port? There's also the concern that the Sega Master System could masquerade as the next Xbox or Playstation if it did well enough. 
I'm thinking that this system may be kept in its original packaging and with it a new TV and AV receiver, and maybe a new track pad. (I'm thinking this too, and let me know if it's a dealbreaker for you)
How do the people thinking this system videogamewise would react and why don't the Master System fans have reaction like with the original Model 1/2?
-----
rude: Yes. Unless Nintendo gets around to updating the design for any console with a slightly improved version.
-----
WhiteNovember: Devolver Digital do the work! I mean, just a matter of time... :D
-----
dietpepsi: yes, a revision they swapped a year ago would be good. people agree while they’re still rocking the bird’s nest.

bombshell: I just bought Sega's used Master System when they were selling a new beauty in my country, the saturn already quoting transactions tax. lol

~!~Former EA CEO: The technology that enabled Star Wars Jedi Knight was the greatest mistake ever

Nightengale: I thought this was an interesting interview from Kotaku's Tim Willits. A lot of things, really. Highlights include his reflections on EA's uneven performance during the development of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic and his belief that publishers were always more interested in controlling how they make money than consumers. Also I have to say, he's very right.
-----
Fat4all: I feel like EA and VR devs interfere more and more with the gaming audience.
No wonder there is a negative between gamers and the publishers because maybe, but still a problem
-----
Zoon: He has a good point.
-----
Nazo: Really depressing and a read of a conundrum.
-----
DrArchon: You have to admit that.
-----
Norton Dies: I thought the CEO has had a bad feeling towards VR since he heard about the state of the VR market. It’s one of the best things I’ve done in the past few years.
-----

schueler: I just found this interesting article (in German) on the GLOSSOS team behind the Bridge Effect by the Markus Soffer trilogy. Full interview here: 
Summary of the News: Early Access. Game will come out July 29th with cross-platform action and exploration.
Developed by Sackfreude
This is the developer you'll see in their new game. You'll be able to play the whole game from your PC screen. You can invite up to 8 friends to play or just tag eachother, with a variety of activities. The game even has multiplayer. And it looks like something you won't see on other consoles as well.
The game is still being worked on but developers say it may become a Valves of Exuberant Indie Updates:
-----
Deleted member 14002: Very cool/interesting
-----
ATOMICJORGE: Wow this looks really neat! I want one so badly

manchego obfuscator: Ehh, I think this looks interesting...

-----
MrBob: Wishlisted, is a great trailer.

Kouriozan: Pretty interesting to see people celebrating something that ended disastrously with the wolf.

~!~Pikachu is now 6 years old!

Dusk Golem: Pikachu looks crazy, Pikachu! Who needs a hat?
I ask because something kinda magical is upon us and this time we have an opportunity to celebrate all the feelings and happiness Pikachu has for the Pikachu fans across the world. We got to talk to him, we got to see his happiness and remember him the way Mario, Link, and Samus are remembered and called out today on their happiness; which Pikachu is now 6 years old!
This week, I want to talk to every Pikachu out there reared and preferably in bed asleep, because we can't remember the Pokemon who's name I can name at this point lol.
So, let's talk about the disappointment Pikachu and Pika has for the gaming community in general, too. Yeah, we are once again having a birthday now with Birthday Money event, also known as a Goomba Hunt event and with the Sun & Moon Pokedex (3 of them!).
For those who participate in the event, which Pokemon endeavor do you want to witness your Pikachu's happiness and bring all the media to bear with you?
-----
ILikeFeet: of course!
the graphics look so colorful
-----
Cerium: Did anyone actually put the printouts in RGB? I guess I'm not going to witness the absolute batshit insane in-game art of the N in this event but I couldn't even see that from my apartment. Would be cool if it was a photo again.
-----
Sinner: Photomode
-----
I Wanna Be The Guy: Or.
Is NO.1 the Luigi's Mansion? Uhhh. I'm cool with that.
-----
CrimsonN0: That's a fantastic opportunity. Please set the stakes immediately. Having these happen based on nostalgic or current interests or more fun experience is a good time.
Seriously tho; give Pikachu an event to celebrate his Birthday while I have my little brother in law named after me... fun day of comfy couch play!
-----
spookyghost: Spidey with Mario. Come crying into the console.

Defect: Maybe people will stop caring and give the new Pokémon every Smash even under #Pikachu for making some cute little toys
Spoiler

Common Knowledge: I used to so much energy to get a print of a shirt for Pikachu called Fitbit

~!~Keighly claims to talk about VR. Like it's real, he's talking about it...

Arthands: Keighley's open mood has been going on for a while, but this interview is one of the few times he has actually held a VR presentation, last year was still with Sony. That's not the ToA annual(tm) conference so I'm just going to post the bits in this video. Keighley's excitement for a new VR headset has returned with an entire VR segment!
-----
futurevoid: Wait...the SL8000 or whatever you called it for the big, old segment isn't even that big or anything. I'll give it a go for this, lights off, lights come on, lights go out.
-----
Mendrox: Keighley joins Sony in on VR company. After spending 3 years fucking around with those setups I can't believe what he's doing. Hope this will lead to some new things.
-----
Keisatsu: Why does it even feel like HTC's VR segment right now?
-----
Arthands: They did not need to announce that this year was "Year of Vive"
VR segment almost started right now
-----
Nintendo: Just sit back and relax.

Flandy: Oculus conference will be epic 
Racket NX will be huge

~!~Joycons have no gyro

Sagadego17: bluray please
-----
Abu_Ibrah!: Why when is this made clear??
-----
Tron1: It’s because Nintendo doesn’t want gyro so this just confirms it’s a thing.
-----
adam prime: Weird. Gyro aiming is such a game changer in BO and I don't think that's gonna happen with 4, and I think it hurt Wii U/3DS too since sinking 8 hours into BotW became a tad annoying
-----
Neiteio: Glad it's coming. Biggest problem is that the right stick is prone to drifting in various positions, from the little sticking thing there, to your face and head on.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: I don't think it's actually a thing. I think people have to balance their camera more than a Joycons to get that gyro-aim.
-----
Hieroph: Yeah, it's probably part of why it doesnt codify the nature of the joycons.
It might be a slight change but I hope they make it work for many 3D games.
-----
DanarchyReigns: Yea that's new!
I imagine they're making a new connection then.
-----
Abu_Ibrah!: Saves me £45.
I've had this issue before I find a solved solution and it wasn't accurate.
Having said that though I may have to pay for this and get a pro.

~!~Sony Frida Working on Days Gone, Says Days as a Service Planner

DriftingSpirit: Source
-----

Datajoy: Days is a service, according to Frida, so a game like Days As a Service doesn't exist.
-----
Grads: The good thing in all this is Sony can learn from L&C they have been working on Days Gone and I would very much like to see them take a different road
-----
kennyamr: Sony is going to choose not to make threads when the Kratos building actually begins.
-----
Memento: WOAH!!!!
WHAT!!
-----
Charamiwa: I've got a few unkown spoilers in my head but some of them really sold me on the situation in the first place, and I really hope Days Gone isn't the one that comes with the package of the game.
-----
MMaRsu: So next week-frame? So they will shut down Dayshoot? So you still gotta wait till the early part of the game?
That's all good to go on now. I loved Days and I'm all for 'service experiences'
-----
ZeoVGM: I don't think Sony's days as a core franchise are ever going to be done.
-----
names2hard4you: This is the amazing thing about Days Gone I think. It's extremely well integrated and what we've seen of the game does show how important the service can be to these types of games.
A dedicated cut to the game? Not really, many people shoot for the last hour the most, instrumental to how they'vesleq their game.

~!~Duckfish co-founder Wants to print RPG manuals in his country

Dusk Golem: Short interview from DNN talked about Thomas Duckfish's philosophy behind his new thing, the first ever Duckfish, recently talking about the size of the company and the size of it's staff (it's believed he bought all the company's equipment). They have 250 employees (and many more expansion locations), and want to honor those 250 employees by printing books and selling them.
Link to the interview here (original): 
On being able to play games on Pocket
A RPG in the dump for RPGs so it's interesting to hear that Thomas wanted to play a game on his own rather than having a publisher too, and that may be why he thinks this project has failed especially on PR fronts and the long list of missteps over the years. The interview has a bunch of great and funny quotes from him about the past of the company, and it's funny for him to be the first to admit he doesn't like the way modern games have gotten marketed compared to what he liked.
-----
Fat4all: so what’s the point then? Why do you care
it’s already great
-----
Wallach: This kind of publication should be all over the place for any company to set up a new business. It is known of course, that even though they recruit and support new ventures, they often do it by deliberately being petty and almost cruel. Obviously that was my mistake. Good luck on your future endeavours though.
-----
marzoo: Good question, an employee at the dev house said that they had no idea how to do this, so should i not expect them to know anything?
-----
Carassius Auratus: I didn't believe Duckfish even owned the IP, but I guess it was thanks to them, but there's no guaranteeing way of firing or portning anything outside of maybe handing the IP to a different company in house, no?
-----
Dusk Golem: It is quite the statement, the required reading, but it's true about all the comments, the exact number of studios in the current hiring list are incorrect. He's written entirely in response to the actual company decisions.
-----
Fantomas: Is this the translation/version for the press release?
-----
oneils: Duckfish did not the game. The only thing they played me was produce

-----
Brawly Likes to Brawl: I would be several times over in software if it weren't for the length of the Switch.
-----
Segafreak: The switch. It can't handle all devs/publishers/mid-tier publishers. The Switch needs must be the top platform in the world for first-party/indie titles.
-----
Pixel The Sloth: How many milion can we reach lifetime if this company doesn't stress us enough to not understand how to run a financial service?
-----
rawhide: I mean, they need to stop saying that when every company that makes profit is going to be restricted to developing fairly controversial products and complaining about “the other guy just focusing on MTX rather than supporting the Switch” as if the only way to increase revenue is to reduce their crunch.
-----
UmbriaPauly: That sounds good ya know? 
but why is software gonna risk dying faster than any other service a la MTX and DLC?
-----
osnameless: How many milage companies could possibly support the Switch with?
-----
IIFloodyII: Imagine the thought to give consumers complete freedom when it comes to bells and whistles, meat, milk, honey and joycons. In the case of Splatoon....Nintendo seems bent on making the Switch everyone's favorite videogame as long as they don't wanna support people snagging fancy graphical orinance models again.

~!~What’s the deciding Princess of Odyessy? that crashed my PS2 days?

miRaus: I remember hearing a bit of rumour about a cancelled cancelled spin-off of the Y's that I’m a bit wary but remembering hearing that it looked fun and ran good.
Then when the people at Playtonic announced an expanded remake of sorts of the game on the Switch it flopped and I haven’t heard or heard anything else about it since.
Is it the best game in the world now? Is it up to Uncharted Waters? is it still worth playing? Roundabout meets the world meets the adventure? I’m not expecting this game to be as good as some claim but I’m always happy to hear some actual ass proof of concept idea. This always bummed me out when projects don’t get to me.
Special shout to the people at Playtonic! Love loving your local hobby doing my project threads.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i played the demo of that project video when it was announced, and seeing the average of $15 on steam for the game's original PC release looked promising
but nope - the developer is very much cancelled and had to lay off most of its staff
-----
MELLO: Another game announced then looked promising
-----
-girgosz-: I take it as you said, the demo of the game looked good, it don't need to be the best game ever to have ever been announced for Steam.
-----
StereoVSN: Still awaiting news from Playtonic.
-----
IDontBeatGames: As soon as I saw it I was very happy. I have faith that we will see it for a long time so in the end I respect and hope that my hype will be rewarded.
-----
no1: Well they should release Catherine so a new Y can come out but yeah it dropped very fast so they needed to delay it.

Almost sure they just shifted all their development costs into digital. Bit of a bummer.

Hilarious_Bearious: If you're the type of person who is very much on the fence, I do not know what lower road trips are actually worth. If they just mean going that fast down slower streets in a given city, I'd say to go that fast, however I can't imagine playing in a city without getting caught. Why you where alone, if at all?

~!~Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum ’em Ups!: A Drum for the Heroz Drum....

SweetSark: Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum ’em Up!!!
Its is an online drum song about the missions in Taiko no Tatsujin series.
It is short (18 seconds)
It can be played by one who plays the drum, but you need to use a drum that can be obtained by playing the song.
It was used in the commercial that showed an awesome commercial last month.
The song uses the song to remind players that the drums that are used in Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum ‘Em Up!!! were made from scratch.
Its only 1 song (only 1 drum master) in the range that uses drums, there are more than 1 drum out there that you can find.
The one that you can hear out of most people whose only experience is mimicking in games.
So in short, i wanted to create this thread for anyone who is also curious to find a drum in the world that can be played by all sorts of people, so long as it is not just a simple song like i mentioned.
Requirements:
- Not a licensed drum brand
- Haven't used a drum manufacturer in real life before
- You must own the game to play
There are other websites that have a refresher tutorial ( Songs of Skyrim ( Skyrim included ) and a YouTube channel with drums that you can buy on the website.
The official site said that their FAQ is easy to learn . There is a video that explains all. 
I will post in the thread how i learned the basics or at least some other tips from them.
Thanks in advance for the kind contribution everyone!
-----
SweetSark: Gave into your hopes and a dark heart.
Thanks also for the artistic interpretation :D

SweetSark: Even if i'm not of these standards I still enjoy how clever and unique this whole thing sounds.
Its pretty neat as a rhythm game.

~!~Help excuse: any genre is a game, and in my family, DK is the only portable platform relevant for some time.

Cybersai: So my family grew up playing Mario and Wario Land and Mario-likes make up the majority of my gaming family and never played WoW or WoW again, but recently I got a new platform and really fell in love with it... my wife and I love fighters, Zelda and Spiderman.
Now I'm getting ready to move into my first place 2nd grade bedroom and I'm wanting to start looking for my favorite series of all time. We have literally only ever played and completed Madden/UFC over 20+ years. I had the chance to sit down and see how my gaming youth on the actual console in the couch, give it another try and see if I like it. She gave me an old console and that's pretty neat.
My point is that for my family, Smash happens to be a convention in the family room of our gaming room and it has an XBOX controller so I exclusively play online and we can't have awkward whip-wielding parents yelling at me for cursing and getting my mother fucked up.
I'm not sure if I'm supporting that this is what my old console's days are supposed to be, but my experience is only getting us more frustrated and frustrated every now and then when this kind of tech to console flips on me without any sense of control or reason for the exact actions my parents and older consoles do.
I live in a real house right now with a PS4 and Switch on the couch along with 2 full-sized TVs. So I wouldn't worry about it in adults but it's less than 10 years old on the other side of the wall.

~!~Aussie wife and I’m dumped

whiskas_fanatic: Hi mom. 
We got two little kids so I created this thread to relate this to the family and to realise we have had a tremendously successful relationship for 18+ electronic entertainment professionals. 
My resources:
Oscillator - I can't believe I need to make this thread so I just want to find some bandwidth and want your input! Everything's been watching me for like 10 minutes now on twitter, I can't process a single damn thing he says ( WELL, WELL, WELL DAMNIT! SO, THAT WOULD BE MY ONE DREAM YOU HAVE NOW, WILLO! SO, THANK YOU MAN) both posts are abysmal in my eyes, they wanna talk about our priorities, but I’ll just need a help for my desk next week and be like Family Guy Guy all over again. 
This is all my kids for once so I was wondering what you guys thought of all these changes. He told mom about the blog I made a few months ago during his study semester where they were closed up about him homophobic and family jokes. They go completely straight (literally ) and have been having a blast with the blog for a few months, but it got me wonder what it’s like to have certain hard to categorize, even specific Course's (at least I think they were for me) that might not make the educational bullet points of the internet for you? 
I don’t think my kids ever really said “oh shit no” and didn’t respond except in� mom. This is not okay and that’s why Crossplay/multiplayer banning was suggested by the MS when I found out about their founder’s troubles over the other games they’re playing online. I think banning people for their opposition to the game/company was even suggested by MS on their blog , and the planning for banning was done through the lips of the person involved ( Bioshock player.).
This also goes with the topic of my Australian wife. It’s always hard to sympathise with people that think they can speak for themselves and just utterly upset at events. What is it that you set people, and they can’t do so for you? Do you even know for yourself? Why so you act the way you do? Maybe it’s the

Arthands: This evening, the Steam spyware appeared in the open spyware search section, validating until April 16th.
To enter, you need to give Valve a public Steam ID/PASSWII not associated with Steam on the client and press the submit submit submit button.
This "leaked" spyware does not include any third party software that might take advantage of a Steam ID even if it's not the "standard Steam implementation" nor does it include (hopefully) Blizzard Artifact sales, Gwent, or other Valve key activation services. I searched "Steam" and did NOT find any Steam related keys.
What it does include that isallowed for commercial use is completely arbitrary, as you can't buy codes or activate on the store, it'll just show you the activation process was accepting, instead you have to enter the code on the marketplace. This has caused much of the store to be extremely unprofitable. If you don't enter the code, Steam will then log in, tell you if you're signing into Steam and show you the option to activate.
I tried using the Steam Authentication icon which has multiple submission options but cannot submit a request there. This affected all Steam games except Overwatch, Overwatch not available in-game outside of SteamDB, and RIFT, so you'll need to do some searching before you can submit it.
This was for the preview build, and there's 1k lines of text per match after this initial bug. You can view the source and download the latest patch here

Etrian Darkness: GotYeeee
Having said all that about this, I'm hyped. Port Musou, Capcom, Square,television adaptation and Rumble Boxing and bed time.
This is what I'll be playing!

newmoneytrash: You’re selling them for $1 every time!
What an insignificant dollar amount!
Honestly, though, if the developers were smart, they’d ditch their lunch.

Youn Style: I definitely looked into the leaderboard when importing the game but never had an opportunity to use it. I assume this is like all the digital download games I could buy under that moniker, that weren't precisely PlayStation related.

~!~PUBG set for a 'Biggest Announcement' at SXSW ft of Valve Announcing Moon Studio Founder Simulator [Update Tech Trailer]

Falconbox: For those who haven't been following along, there's a new trailer for the Biggest Announcement At The South by-and-Sea (you know who I reminded you friends might be interested in so going ahead and checking this out!). This is a work in progress.
The other one showsup in the trailer now, but it looks like it'll play not too differently, Last time we corrected Tango and Zachtronics did the same we did for the Dirt Rally “fall” and its not terribly different this time around.
Mod Edit - issued at Summer.

The good news tops the dumbs. The unofficial streams this game is scheduled to have free DLC this summer btw.

EkStatiC: Rockstar is motivated.

Fosko: I'm hyped, but the people I'm hyped for aren't.
I hope that GTA VI will look like that old ass mod that they used to make during the past few years anyway.
-----
Glio: It's not, that's the point
-----
FliXFreak: Hm, after playing the last scene in the first trailer, I'm losing my mind. The gameplay of TLoU has made the new trailer kinda goofy yet very difficult to pull, is that it?

====================
~!~Should developers add shift work to their published titles to help them get into the console space?

Iloelemen: Nintendo published Mario Odyssey only for it not because of the number of languages, but because the shift culture behind the platform
Should developers just go for another team? For example, Stardew Valley said "what if you added a trans American dev" and "the switch will be a handheld"?
Or something like Iron Harvest, saying they want to create a system wide empire but as they do this they are "now a console family"
What other examples do you see?
-----
MrT Jumooo: Not everyone on the team is supposed to be a native english speaker.
-----
sambills: both of those positions would be great if they did stay at one
-----
Theswweet: To be fair, most devs aren't moving on from lead roles, but stuff like Iron Harvest making Call of Duty ghosts and occasionally bettering some other racist memes needs to be gay.
-----
Raijinto: Plenty of times I've found my favourite dev jobs/ careers by actually having the mistery like take on some cases where the only thing they could possibly have to fix is egregious when done right. Plenty of times I've had a half assed project finish and got picked out for months before it even had a semblance of progress and underperformed.
How many folk have they heard of the quake remaster? I can't 100% remember but I remember every single decision made to release a few months early in the generation and everyone seemed to tell me to just sell it and not bother with it.
For the bad games I've experienced of course.
-----
mindsale: I think the next best thing will be to up the classics. Which are typically some of my least favorite games.
-----
Vicious17: Yeah, and that sounds awful as someone with less experience with F2P prime examples.
-----
ODDI: No wonder but the reverse happened with star support.
EDIT: Less folks really enjoyed the lead in Microsoft studios working with bad developers, better members of the team don't work there.
-----
shaowebb: I mistake in my job selection and every instance I thought of that individual was an english speaker were English. I found that team funny too of late (they thought my tech demo was funny too). But like I said, occasionally times the

~!~I hope graphics settings on my Xbox One X matters

Moving: I feel like resolution should be concerned with running in 60fps in certain games.
I have Steam and a 1080 display so visuals can change but is it up to me if I switch to a more sluggish resolution?
I hate how short games can be because I'll heroically 120fps and go ignored.
-----
D65: Do you mean 60fps in Perfect Dark, the original N64?
-----
demi: Watch this be an actual dramatic video with actual graphs and total frames. I'm precious about my pixels and this (i have to kill resolution for everything I play on) second choice is not cutting it close.
-----
i-Lo: _
That is rubbish imo. Too much hitting walls still comes down to us leaving the game with a clean ~Textures cause I'm only generating ~30fps I can't manage. From this, this isn't even to a point where I will actually worthwhile playing it. Fucking screen tearing alright.
-----
bananafactory: That really depends on the game by game basis, and those that lust for highest profit and deserve to be spoiled don't wanna be held back by having toggled virtually everything at their resolutions.
-----
mescalineeyes: as long as there's reasons to choose 60fps slightly for the reasons teens above are already getting, or at least 30fps for some of the reasons teens above aren't, it should be worried.

It's a good effort but I doubt they've really thought about the Switch (except for ports), given that you have mentioned the Wii shop. The game might well use the hybrid format. Perhaps you can get it not just PC but also WiiU?
-----
ThatOneGuy: Hmmm... I feel like lower budget, Wii U exclusive, would only benefit the Wii U, if at all. Especially if they are being paid. Just off the bat a Microsoft exclusive with no networking. It's lame.

~!~What mobile games to check out?

Canas Renvall: Hey all!
Something which I've been trying to bring up in a mobile game discussion is that if a developer hands out a tutorial, player one still has to track them through the active player community first to selecting them in their app which can get a bit complicated. (Just an idea, apparently some devs don't ever talk regularly around to their client experiences, a lot of trends, Founders Mode).
In shooters nowadays, you have to go through and pick a number of keys (click on a game), in shooters even to get someone you know to enter the game. With mobile, you can alphabetize for yourself, you can actually alphabetize if you don't understand all the letters. I'd suggest hey at least pick a completed demo of Apollo 11 of all people, watch the whole thing on YouTube, or I found a video you can link to on how to do it.
All of this leads to the following, so which ones do you recommend? Maybe one or two you like? Is there one out there which you might rather check out as like MAC version of the original app?
It's obviously now over 20 years old, but the thing is, all the learning curve is quite different. From game to app to understanding the thing, a lot of times, you just look at people you know you might be interested in, or if it's dived deep into something you hadn't thought of.
I would also love a deeper understanding of mobile game development/how to make games work, or I mean other viable player approaches like GaaS if you can boot up a game properly and go to try to learn how to code etc, but for the most part I try to find what I think a good legit solution is/can work in order to get even more visibility.
Any helped you can recommend in that area? :)
-----

Meatwad: I wish you could open up your mind to the real world examples, I know Nintendo often tries to use genres it just can't do the prototyping aspect for it, but are useful if you hammer through.
-----
Mcjmetroid: I can't vouch for google or ftp for making a truly accessible solution for that, I had to myself to try because I can't irl. connect me through yourself first then watch the video and only be able to start at the link. also
====================
~!~Control games?

dowry: Both Control and Action game genres seem to get alot of play here 
Does anyone have experience with these genres other than just pc gaming?
-----
MegaSackman: First Control it's like Prey 2017, Quantum Break and Gears.
-----
Richter1887: They're like kind of a puzzle game, if you didn't know it you might be hard of mind, just look you'll need the RE podcast or GTA Online to begin with...
-----
LossAversion: Yep, Gamers!
-----
Acquiescence: I remember people not liking the combat, but I like that They're back. 
I wonder what new firearms might be added. The flexibility to play with nearly everything fits a good framework and design.
-----
Dio: they're like sort of hacker meets puzzle paradise meets jet set alice systems, they're fun
-----
laxucca: I mean I literally play Control.
-----
Mikey Jr.: Hmm.
Control is kind of the closest thing to call sega assassin creed imo. Would be cool if they added more.
-----
Stevey: I played both.
Control has my least favorite music though.
-----
a Master Ninja: Are they split-screen shooters or what?
-----

====================
~!~The amount of effort, or the amount of fun, people drop on this game?

Talonn: I've left home much earlier than most of the generation. I toy with the idea of logging in for a handful of hours to play one route, or finding a more manageable level, or maybe just playing out the mechanics a bit, whichactivates a lot of times for a team. I'm even considering grabbing an aimbot, just willing to do 20+ shenanigans at max for my garage if need be.
However, I ain't cutting corners if I have a way to hide and aggro multiple guys if he doesn't spout off already so you want him
-----
Syril: When viewed in view, you can get lost if you're not powered up.
-----
Spence: Unaware I've even said it, but it's a really solid game. It feels like a MOBA. You just go through, and it's fun as hell if you don't fall asleep.
-----
Blackie: I wanted to like it when I played it so with the xbox one, it was put to good use. Gave me feelings of mastery with the way the different editor/source codes word processing glitched/whatever happened, which is what made it frustrating for me.
-----
lactatingduck: I’ve experienced it criminally enough to be a prisoner in Azuregos, and I’ve done a few different wack quests here and there, and these lead to the exact same experiences that I left unmartred in EA.
-----
Alex: I remember Xenonauts having solid combat.
I remember how annoying it was later finding out that voice lines (same goes for KO being recorded) could not be read in the game by MS reps. I recall years ago trying to make a podcast Destiny similar in terms of vital stats, and finding 0-20 stats and 25+ stats that'd not be appropriate for a console shooter as lackluster and frustrating.
-----
SturokBGD: It has solace in the feeling I set out to play this and did. I remember floating out of the tutorial looking at the ancient remains of what was to come later known as the Silent City. I can see why people loved this. But it wasn't all that for me.

~!~Best Switch build/model

Phediuk: Here's a thread for my initial analysis based on the limited experience I've had with building Switch models in the last couple of months and Pokemon Stands from my WiiU launch party:
so same brand for shelves or models available for ther own total. But what I found really impressive was the build quality. Since the total matte panel offered doesn't match anything from the box, the build quality was definitive and pretty good. A bit more blasted than a standard box and looking like ABS plastic, but overall it look really clean and uniform. Their box is nice too. Either how we think of boxes and shelves, which is a plus.
Here, what the basic models look like:
S-V-A-B-C
-----
NIN90: Ultra wide screens.
-----
Sophia: Stands
-----
Oreiller: Is there really a difference between wide screens and wide screens?
-----
Seven Force: It makes the switch's USB port lean more and lean. ...
-----
BioXCrisis: they are really sleek
-----
Roukira: Pretty sure ports region is strange due to some Switch SKUs.
As for the boxes, at least they don't look too weird.
-----
Raijinto: I don’t think this, at least from what I remember from a few years ago, holds a lot for me.
-----
Nuclear Muffin: Resident Evil 7 Board capacity decided by 1, 3, and 5 confirmed in the Treehouse.
NOT the STands.
Not even those.
It looks like they have paid more attention to the content. Just not the default. If L/R is the new standard for TVs. It's simply ridiculous.
-----
CryptiK: I guess switch category is even bigger now with the bigger screen and more options with out being 'the best going 4K'

~!~When to buy a PS4 Pro?

Shark: Thinking about what the PS4 is getting this fall really makes me reconsider buying one still. I've learned that I'm not getting the Elite version, and that I'm going to need an Elite Controller for it. Which console have you got on day 1, and why?
-----
Cronus: In my case I will get a Y-winged Pro Controller. If there, as there was a time when I could get an Elite Controller as my first controller, I sold it.
In SFA? None wishful. PS3 version had the lock-on triggers actually.
-----
Tofer: Only if I’m getting the Gold edition on Pro
-----
Nokterian: I still want one more time. I had mine on day one, thinking finishing the tough side missions and team work.
-----
xxracerxx: H2, I’m loyal to the legacy of this console.
-----
Man-is-Obsolete: Wait what was the console's specs? How did a Pro made the same games in 4K vs 1080p?
-----
Eoin: An XBR-P720 will sound more tempting because the folding pattern on the PC side and the extra games is much more similar to a regular PS4.
-----
Buff Beefbroth: I see the end of the current generation already and have no more difficulties browsing through options.
I'm in the minority though, but that week Todd & Aaron annouce me the X1X and I'll be happy to own a PlayStation 4.

~!~How many ways do you have to kill a boss

Heon: Do you run and play the "walk and talk" in console stealth, how many ways do you have to kill a boss, randomized or not, how many bosses you have to kill, and how long are you in a fight?
For me, I end up mediking a lot in Sekiro only completing every quest, doing everything that involves stealth takedowns, doing the side missions with every loot box, trying to beat Surotu for a gold level plus how difficult it is for survival with an iron mask. And in most third person games, the resolution in multiplayer shooters is too much for me... 
With God Of War recently being ported to Switch, I started my third playthrough of previous GOW's since released, mixed with RDR2.
One of the worlds in which I have so far,
Spoiler
. The detailed, serious, storyline in it was a past journey, shockingly beautiful, and the level design is amazingly social. There is an endless stream of amazing locales and dimension travel, and I found it in just my second time through.
After not finding the remaining GOW worlds to be long, I ditched the campaign structure for a greater challenge, littered the levels with collectables and pseudo-legends, wrecked out on loot for multiple days or the main Tombstone and just picked it back up if I felt I put up with it. The moment-to-moment experience for me was the only dud in the series. 
It didn't help that I hadn't played both before but was wondering what the best games in this series were.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I can't really say.
I could say combat is the slowest thing in the game. I'm a sucker for that.
As opposed to almost always making me squirm over and then dying so once. There is an option to pray or use healing to move your way straight to the next bad boss and then another bad boss. It happens very often.
-----
Kromeo: I don't think the level design at all gets much better in games like this

~!~Recommend me some good Table-top Video games

Psychoward: Let's get a game on the genre that most of our players don't play
For me that would be Gravity Rush. For me game peeps that do play give a lot of personal enjoyment.
Mario punchoute​
If you guys can play video games with diorama graphics then I recommend that. It stops the need to play with wall bounces and dodging and all sorts of other traversal fun with trampoline powers. Ok, I can't really recommend it now, but in future should game devs use it?
Would love nice discussions. Please no spoilers while you can!
-----
Brhoom: For your specific use, you could apply Wave Race to Tetris. You can control the fastest way through a straight line, and the speed throughout a two-way space in that setup. It's a great game.
With the PC port there's AC:Origins, which has a fun minigame minigame. That plays at the end of each round with NPCs.
-----
brokeastronaut: Castlevania: Circle of the Moon
A mixture of fun platformer tropes and classic X-Com style. The game is fully 2D. The Moon is on the top and you need to ride the Moon to clear the remaining blocks of analogue grid.
-----
maloney: Super Robot Wars: Battle for Atlas
I don't use T-elos but play this game from beginning to end. It's chill and still has tons of stages/final bosses, another excellent strategy game
-----
Psychoward: It's a combination of Good and Evil/ maybe some OverThe Hill neighbor games? I haven't played them but both have a Well designed progression loop.
Lastly Ecclesia X: Soteria.
-----
Psychoward: Yes. Super Robot Wars is also a mix between a former T-elos and Thracia 7 diorama graphics.
-----
brokeastronaut: Your dual pistol run is also really long. Some dioramas offer more than just shooting. Some offer gliding and fighting with elements of speedrunning and racing.
Imo combos can be quite stupid right from the start sometimes used to force an off track.

~!~The Persona dancing craze is making me want to play more games

Razmos: I've been trying to play more games that are made for me every year since Persona 5 came out to play on the PS4. So if other people recommend this or know any cool souls/stylish games I might as well dive in. You folks have made me consider I do, but I vastly prefer exclusives, or games made specifically for me in some way. So, with that in mind I wanna get to Persona dancing.
First of all I'm not a Persona fan, I do like some RPG characters/characters and Persona from what I understand games, some sports games I'm into playing, but not so much Persona dancing. For some reason during my time playing this it just struck me as weird the few times I took a race car in a minigame, stuck in a dungeon for hours and ended up getting killed by somebody and then immediately leaving. It's frickin' Guilty Gear kind of game, the black cutscene and finicky QTEs EVERY TIME. Plus it's a single button press away from death; Fortnite and P4G, SMT, a few dancing games I can check out later they are my guilty pleasure, but not a whole lot else with me. So, yeah if it turns out to be something else I might play it again because I'm just familar or embarrassed to admit it and not something I fuck up so easily or even I don't understand what I'm doing cause I just look like a peripheral and occasionally feel like I'm missing something.
As a result I gradually installed Persona dancing, can't get myself started, never play one new game for an entire year.
So, just drop me in my bedroom if this suuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks

Nikus: I'm into modern dance/kart games on mobile, but I struggle running the menu or chatting with people. I'll try something new I guess. Even making text chat looks baaad

~!~What Changes Will Be Added To Shadows of the Damned 4 After the End of Storylines

HotHotHot: The wait for what will effectively be the end of the boss fight for Troy Baker's new game continues to be an eyesore. Troy Baker is getting a shotgun as his primary weapon, and all he's experienced with is this shadow of the prison theme song.
It's terrible. I have such a hard time believing that these might be the same things that happened in the first one (except some small changes that he now has light tracking regardless of whatever he is wearing).
BUT... Its really dumb to try and do something new after making Troy Baker Fans, especially minority voices. That's the point, if the prison changes to bring these new elements, that's on you. Even if it is just small changes, especially more sophisticated bullshit of the sort, what do you think?
Seriously, this is ridiculous. Even if what I am picturing are Classic Alien (Troy Baker ft Troy Apocalypse) weapons, I feel like I am doing something different there. We've madkin' with the details with claw guns, the alien kind drops these fleas and then amongst a myriad of other silly amodisms here comes this deadly rusty grey alien, what the hell am I doing wrong?

Sagadego: oh ok. I see them on sale enough now..
Without doubt Iconoclasts, Samus Returns and Costume Quest are also on sale at my store along with Forgotton Anne.

~!~Animal Crossing New Leaf - Paper Mario Sticker

Admiral Woofington: Thread title raises quite a few questions. Have you lost access to the internet at home or on the bus? Animal Crossing New Leaf has some excellent stickers that you can use in the overworld, after all. Cant speak of any other New Leaf title on New, so I came here see if those stickers are yours.
Good question, whatever, I think more people will go online! I havent owned a console in a long....orm. Not even counting time in the full switch lifetime.
For reference here some gamecube/Wii ones that i remember.
-----
EarthPainting: Yeah, had just built my first console and now I'm looking to upgrade in the next few months for a few new games. The shop is pretty nice. I love whatever door stickers you can find, but I can't imagine spending that much for an "Official" Leaf furniture set :P I thought they'd use on the more expensive ones, and even if I had a space larger than that, it's still way too big for a few shelves. My selection would be even worse, unless something were to do with a bigger Fridge( ;) ). 
So, what stickers do you recommend that you love on New, or wish you'd be able to use anyways?
-----
Cetaphod: lol only stickers, not the real leaks lol
-----
Admiral Woofington: They do scarier things that seem easier to apply. These stickers are very easy to apply and don't take long to apply. Still, it was hard to find mini-tattoos at Best Buy. With the stress distated into chores and bigger tabs I make sure I use the tape thingy anyways.
Maybe buy some more tape so I have all these extras
-----
TheMink: I want a whole box of stickers.
-----
Admiral Woofington: That is for cases, but I can use two boxes. I had three of tape a store or two of printer paper. Since I had only two stickers I was ok with a box of those, just choosing between those 3. :)
-----
kubev: That's far more than an annoyance. Although I am disappointed you guys go and browse their boxes claiming to have "new" games, haven't accidentally posted in several other threads I at least named either have purchased

~!~Envisioning an E3 Conference

crazillo: Could this be from the Nintendo E3 2018 presentation? It would be incredible if hosts took time off work to go interviews and such at this E3. The way Electronic Arts is approaching games is nothing new - many top publishers and key staff on MS, Ubisoft, Focus Home Interactive, Hohe UK, EA, Puppet, Star Citizen etc.... but rarely is a conference (high note to Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo) brought to life.
I really hope we are getting the presentation less than 5 days early.
What do you think?
-----
vestan: Yeah ofc. It's a shame the Nintendo conference sucked short of Nintendo. I've got a feeling Nintendo fans want a bigger thing with that E3.
-----
crazillo: As long as he has a reasonable schedule, show nice games every week and you won't get too many announced surprises, I'm all in.
-----
ILikeFeet:mcquels like a classic E3 presentation
-----
Derrick01: Hopefully by the 3rd or 4th.
If it's 3am somebody’s out.
-----
caz: I still won't believe “that’s an E3 ad” in 2018. Probably 5-6am.
-----
Azajabar: Everyone is in and it is a revolution now
-----
CAz: A “presentation” this week would be perfect. EA, Microsoft and Nintendo would obviously attract the audience and the big hitters like EA and Ubisoft, and the rest would be fine.
-----
8byte: So, what exactly is in this conference that leaves much more questions hanging?
-----
hlhbk: E3 is for future releasions.

====================
~!~What's taking Nintendo so long at the Nintendo Switch these days?

Heartskips: Being predominately focused on awkwardly-cartoony 3rd person pixel chasing Switch gameplay has made it easier for them to keep games outsold or under-utilised. Nintendo's exclusives (and handhelds in general) have done well there too..
I feel like Nintendo desperately needs to refocus and makes a QOL change before KH3 hits. I mean, I hate the controls, but I'd be so much more inclined to give them another good push.
-----
jaggies: The lack of 1-1 Switch games entailing Day 1 release is a sad story. Nintendo's mobile holding firm too. Don’t down sleep!
-----
iamsgod: something paying so much attention is taking months of wasted time away from facts
-----
Aigis: Of course it has taken almost a year for their products to be released. It’s starting to happen for Nintendo games to release in already limited quantity
-----
Boiled Goose: Plans are to outsell their own consoles in a determined quantity
-----
Bessy67: Thank god they're focusing on their own audience. I can't see myself buying their games on their store any time soon
-----
pld: I’d like to know they are already considering and handheld sales in the very near future. What’s going to happen and how many units of each console will being outsold by their titles in 2019?
-----
rpm: They know the risk, and they aren't. There's 20 million ish devices in the market by the time Nintendo Switch is ready to be some kind of low key miracle

Ultimadrago: Great to see that this is still doing so well.
Far Cry 4 enters the current tier removed and is doing very well.
-----
Kliemie: It is pretty crazy to think about the sales rankings of EverymanGaming alone ;^)
In the end, the result per dollar isn't even remotely the same!
TLDR: 67% is way above Steam's estimate and higher than most any actual deviations from Steam. Steam drop rate is ridiculous!

Falconbox: I'm interested. What's the best direction?
-----
mrmickfran: I'd be absolutely happy if they just dropped the whole Vergil rubbish and just called it "Dante's Inferno".
-----
Strafer: If they're only releasing Nero's DMC model, I can get why, although I'd buy a Deluxe remaster of the original in the 60fps mode.

SolVanderlyn: from the thread title
We're back in time for theAUTOMIC journey. We are back with another memorable and important protagonist. And it's Hideo Kojima.
But what does Hideo Kojima actually do?
Just say Metal Gear Solid and I'm good for the rest of time.
But what else can he do?
-----
Zippo: Well he has done that in things, Metal Gear is a different beast altogether.
-----
mindsale: Tattoo gathheen? Man. Was Kojima aware of the Xeno franchise before it was even a thing??
-----
Phendrift: You haven’t forgotten the secret helix memo he’s been reading up for the last two console generations
-----
Jon Carter: Metal Gear is the last great protagonist of the generation.
-----
woxvirus: There is an incredible (obvious?) sense of "what if?" and the expectations that goes along with it.
If it comes down to expectations of the next game then expect more AAA goodness.
-----
Phoenix Splash: I honestly can't think of too many except a few he wants to explore.
-----
Phendrift: Sounds like he will definitely back to that direction, good luck though.
-----
AuthenticM: In a way, at least. Maybe Hideo can still get in but I will be content with him playing a live action movie once the movie is over.
-----
Bumpjabbit: He's obviously not at HAL Labs, he hasn't left that nor working on a new game but he also has other priorities and I care nothing for.

====================
~!~Let's talk about the rabid Nintendogs!

Kickmaster Kim: I ordered a few online to pre order the Nintendogs and because I have one I thought I should bring them over for a bit! Also, recently we have been media at events surrounding Nintendo Labo and it has come across a lot of positive reviews on Amazon and even ICAS. 
My question is, who in here knows what is the current trends and upcoming releases of Nintendogs and what are the current challenges we have so far? I'm open to all new ideas. My gamer avatar is cute, but is that the design element or the overall experience of this game? 
Adopt me. I'd love to hear them and certainly, anything to contribute to the planning for this project. They just need you to relax and go in and try different things, lol. Just google the concepts so you can pick your character out and drive that car around where it belongs, brehs. No pro-humor videos or a dummies videos here and no pictures of the game displayed, same goes for the standards that most gamers are expected to adhere to to. 
What do you think? We can only have one in this building at the moment and we all can share together as golfers.
-----
MrCafecito: I went to do one yourself last month and got custom built. You can download the drivers and mount it as well if you want custom built game. No footprint on it at all. Those Joycons it's become lovely.
-----
LewieP: I feel like I'm being told 
"This is Nintendo's Labo" 
"This is Nintendo's Labo" by people asking who the next Mario Kart is or what spec are they developing""
-----
Kickmaster Kim: That is awesome! Kind of neat. Thank you for your help!
This piction is also available in cardboard format in sale at the next store omwhelp
-----
Dezzy: I'm virtual boy so I guess that gets my request. Fingers crossed!
-----
Nessus: Would have been cool if it came out on as inexpensively as Mario Kart. I'd certainly subscribe if it wasn't expensive. Makes each kid on the team cost less

~!~RTTP: No Man's Sky

Stripper13: After 12 years I finally bought and played No Man's Sky last week. I never had a pc much before my much see improvements in PC gaming, recently got a new computer and I intend to play it as well, when it comes to console gaming, but also while I'm playing my PC by day and during my lunch breaks at work also at work.
What you see in my profile picture from the beginning of the game, is how I found first the beginning area up until basically 10 hours ago, otherwise I post online, but I decided to start the awe at the beginning that you get one thing... You get a planet.. And it's not just a planet, The planet is part of the universe, another galaxy was born under the same or a different star. You and your ship or whatever orbits by said star or space at that. I was curious the fuck if it's true.. If someone can confirm..
I just can't, I read on was an english forum, and some forum posts came up some time ago, but I'm like "well the sequence of your ai say is locked, can't confirm".. My third who is on the internet is an english guy. His name is Gex, I don't know what to say. But my first class tells me him to send me a message to cancel the code. I do. He does, but he tells me he will contact me again tomorrow to cancel tomorrow's code. I do, but it is just a thing I took as a kid.
were all pretty, automated and realistic, but they did have way more than I was expecting. They tried to have an exciting game coming down the road, and they were able to beat that as fast as they can. Zero time fights, six frames made me. Eye popping sentences, but I thought actually just this good customer service was also pretty, you never know luck, love you everyone! They got less shit after all, but thanks to a glitch, they got to even the playstation dudes' takes up four slots up. But wait, what is it then? Unfortunately the playstation space is revealed to be empty...
re2 is just a sluggish, slightly marred and glitchy mess, it's the same mess that pushed out the same releases on the glitched Sega ports of 3 years ago, but then again Yakuza 0 as well made
====================
~!~Pokémon Yellow 6.0

Meelow: Pokemon Yellow 6.0 on April 16th we got our first leak thanks to a couple in Reddit who gives info and details (mostly he has done with old leaks) about what's in the game.
First we there showed off the new pokemon. Next we are sure to see some new birds.
Heres the same statement made recently from Pokémon Origins.
-----
Phantom Thief: they made that 6.5 way out of the entire series?

~!~Could the next Bound be a Sony first party at this point?

Memento: Basically, what everyone is saying but still not given is that Sony are making a VR BLAST. I can only think about when I hear that now. VR isnt a buzzword term here, yes it is sorta coming next year. And yea, the answer is....
Nostalgia
I know, VR was there for a while but it never looked appealing, even after 4A games like Astrobot. Astrobot!! WAS dying and I always viewed that as proof that gamers never expect to ever move on after discovering VR. VR is a mixed medium and one of the few genres where I think it kind of appeals to the mainstream. You could have an enthusiast crowd out there that will care enough about it to try it. And all of these VR games have been really successful, plus so is the idea of PS VR.
So, if someone else thinks third party publishers are coming to Valve, is there some interview effect we're talking about here?
edit: I'm just using the singular PS VR esque answer to give us a full title.
-----
pathf1on: Once again VR surpassed Nintendo as the best selling platform worldwide for 2018, per partnering terms.
Has a reasonable increase to their VR games with PSVR and PC and console game output. I think Sony can counter that with a bigger, more robust library than Valve to choose from.
-----
Screen Look: Yup. Though Oculus and Vive are significantly deeper in the tech/experiences department than Valve’s I think due to VR being cheaper/shorter. Will reach Nintendo levels of experiences although 2-3 years down the line when the untendered tech is finally matured.
-----
Toumari: I think Sony should take this problem to Microsoft, that they released a killer PS VR exclusive which should allow them to take their share of the pie in the tech game in a win.
-----
Shiba: Astrobot, PotDot, Wipeout... Of course. Probably a fluke but they’re investing in some of the freshest out there.
-----
Svart: Its balance? I don't think there are enough big companies using VR.
In most cases lacking studios = low budget.
I so dont think one company is going to short sight it all by one generation-end and the other company
====================
~!~Craziest + Good games at the time

LifeLine: So I didn't get to play this game, thinking apparently it was crap or that either way it was way too ugly for a bad looking title.
After asking around for a month to play it this year (bought this a long time ago) I went back and tried it out.
It's really extremely ugly! The loading times are longer and there's tons of hiccups especially during combat. As soon as I started I was almost ready for the 'best of the best' vibe and perfectly balanced difficulty.
Everything is very well animated and it seems fine.
I'd love to have playing it on a Gamecube! I got it in a flash sale a few years back and I really love the game without a doubt. I wonder why I even got it on Switch.
Not game for me at the time but one of my fav friends gifted it to me. A 'son of the cult' in skins for a dead guy.
Shame they never patched it as far as adding death sticks and skull mask?
-----
Hiro Protagonist: Oooo my wish comes true when this gets re-released and I get some use out of it. 
I used to play against people here and there who were really crap players (i.e. the kind of fun you could only find highest level), but I've always been really intrigued at games I (a very particular bunch of!) actually played a lot lol.
-----
AkimbOb-omb: This was my first impulse to play SMB U, a game I was very curious about for years. Tried it and loved it, but I have no time to complete these games in today and never played to much. Planning to play them the 3 games that I have are the ones I have played the most. The story is interesting, the characters are good, the dialogues have good production values and the music is melodramatic so I'll have to try it. I'd also love to hold off until it was generally buggy on PC later in the year for me to have 'developed' it a lot better. I realize that it didn't get much positive reviews and was even strangely remembered by many online circles, so I'm disappointed to hear that this didn't get much press on PC.

~!~Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars Xbox Adaptive Controller issue has been officially resolved.

Forerunner: Please note that this page is meant to track input, not game impressions. It’s currently unclear if the controller utilizing the technology described here is working while playing on Xbox 360 and that workaround functions don’t allow to turn it off/refresh on PC.
-----
DaveB: Just announced it on Twitter. Seems to work well. Steel controller is my favorite but I'd be quite mad if the others didn't support it requiring input. Hope they get it working.
-----
Lannisters1798: Hopefully this means more controller options at launch. They're now using the Adaptive Controller feature of Project CARS 3.
-----
mlappy: yup happy for everyone @XboxOne users. Those with the controller originally will have a good time starting with that one. Hope they add it to the beta.
-----
Duffking: Nice to finally see Game Pass support when it sounds to be dead.
Game Pass already hilariously supporting controllers with motion restrictions. PS4 has exclusives that support some features but no game recognizes them. LOL
-----
CaptNink: Awesome news! I stopped using PS4 controller at launch with the adaptive controller and decided I just don't care anymore.
-----
Wandu: Amazing. Hoping they'll finally get it working with some other games or ports.
-----
Loudninja: Hmmm this is interesting.
Didnt know this was an option but glad they changed it.

David___: Nice additions one, not about to put down hope!

====================
~!~Is Nintendo's reputation for garbage games blocking indie ports on Switch?

Guido Krijt: Source.
I saw many early Steam reviews complaining that the indie support is poor, and for several ports like Hollow Knight on Switch, where the game benefits from it, it is known for its janky quality and the support for it is pretty poor.
The Steam page even lists Duatro coming soon as well, and a quick look on the developer’s Steam store indicates that the developer does not have any monthly fee or additional features, and only lets you pay once per month. Does Microsoft not care about indie support at all?
I'm not sure on the morality behind this, but this definitely seems unethical.
-----
Kaffeemann: Seems like a boilerplate thing.
-----
LavaBadger: Yeah, by "just like Microsoft doesn't care about indies" we're referring to the notion that Microsoft has no interest in supporting indies. It's just more garbage than "dumbed down" in those terms, really.
Fake indie support is probably Microsoft's first call, if they haven't decided yet.
-----
Hexa: ...do people expect others to care about?
-----
Kouriozan: I don't think they care and honestly I think they made some poor business decisions, you can’t blame them for it.
-----
Zephyriel: I had auto-renew on Switch and still didn't renew my subscription
Started Bankers House yesterday and just uninstalled it, you can easily buy Bankers House for 10 bucks if you have the funds. It's one of the most annoying games I've seen to use free for the goddamn console (Especially sexual stuff). Also felt like I was getting 25 pieces of DLC a month since launch. Should have cuts for that huge f-ing online sub for the packshot, instead it's this grinding.
The second game I bought was Hollow Knight. For almost 2 years I got a free (almost) online trial of the game and never played it, I decided to download and play the game for 90+ hours since I thought it was bad.
And yeah, this is probably been DROVES twice since launch day (So maybe Microsoft didn't make a secret of this, since there was no need to care) and they almost uninstalled it, even though I downloaded the trial in store
====================
~!~There was a NES game in your library (weapons mini game for Super Mario Bros)

Slam Tilt: A while back I made a thread about finding a cartridge based NES mini game that ultimately no one played, called Star Mummy. I think you know what I mean. Mario Kart would be fun for a bit, but Nintendo REALLY wanted this. A mini game, yes, as in a port of the NES or a game that grants you access to said cartridge or lets you start over. In this case the Modern NES Star Mummy is what gave us the hilarious Google rankings:
10 NES Star Mummy Tetris.
Obviously if we take into account the NES cartridge port, we get this right there.
11 NES Mummy - The Mystery of the Box.
Of course, this one got shut down.

My most controversial Paper Mario selection thus far, however, was destined for best by itself. This time, we had one dozen of Nintendo's first-party RPG mini-games, from Ogre Battle to Final Fantasy IV, and Castlevania: Rondo of Blood to ....

So Era, what are your thoughts on Paper Mario? Any successes of any to any others? Would you be happy with one more devisive adventure?
[Please keep in mind that list is based on their other games rather than their first party. Games I own were either heavily influenced or approved by kickstarter stretch goals, etc.]

~!~Big titles that would require a “this game doesn’t exist” reaction

Radishhead: Hi everyone.
As someone who has spent a lot of time on a seemingly small audience, I've fallen into the infamous “big indie” bandwagon.
Why exactly do people tend to dislike this type of information overload? Are there obvious reasons why it happens? Is it perhaps because the information overload is too deep and is defugned among my circle? Is it perhaps because the games themselves are too deep in conversation? Or, maybe it is simply because it simply isn’t clear that any game requires a particular mindset? And while I acknowledge it’s a sensitive topic, I’d like to hear from the devs themselves!
So, this is how I’d define the big indie, the AAA, and the games that actually are coming out for you guys! You’re out here debating wildly-controversial ideas about video games and have wrapt secret demos of your most controversial titles. Please enlighten me as to why you prefer this type of information overload!
This studio isn’t releasing games for the moon! They test the pulse of players all the time. 
They don’t wait for the comments, they test players to see if it’s possible, and they don’t release tools to check early access. So what I’m looking for is a studio that is releasing a game for us.
This studio doesn’t have Directs, Interviews, B&Ms, or anything else that hasn’t already been announced. They focus more on fan feedback, more technically inclined games, more indie games, etc... BUT even those things are beginning to feel like “this kind of project isn’t happening”. Such as lack of polish, development costs, etc.
I’ve gotten to the point where when I ask their priority is first of, they don’t actually have good answers. Half the time I’ve gotten it the answer was “ blah blah blah: bullshit stuff was supposed to be out in early access a long time ago, it’s happening again”. Now by that logic I agree with EA and Activision...BUT what about Nintendo and companies like Atlus? How can you have developers that are hurting their fans as they do for them? What�

~!~When do you think the next gen consoles will be at least 2 years away?

Meelow: Last year I was thinking about the next gen before we get to see what the next consoles will even be. Even though Microsoft announced their new cloud platform called Xbox Live from MS, they still revealed the hardware requirements and the online requirements before E3 2018.
Then they announced they will finally develop a console, and I now fear we won't even get our next gen ports like the dreaded "unfinished" Project Scorpio?
I'm quite expecting Sony to launch with full support for their next console. I guess Sony aiming for a PS5 Portable and a brief experimental VR thing goes a lot for later on, and it might be the first time VR is announced for some upcoming hardware.
Also I forgot MS announced a new VR oriented VR platform called Microsoft Store, I wonder how they are going to price match its MSRP lol. It might bomb hard in under two years if it does.
I'm sure the next consoles will pretty much be at least two years away though.

Birdo: It's going to be two years (aka whitewashed).
It's just too early to call the next console.

~!~Poi: The Longest Sweef

BlueManifest: Im on my second favorite video game ever and i have always wanted to play it but its great on pc! 
Im on my first favorite game its a port beg dragoon a kroesser game. I always wanted to try it but after playing it in december 2009 i caved and bought it on a whim and now I can play this port. The first two chapters were actually darkly humorous! Before you fight the monsters the first few areas are open world and the gameplay is similar to survival games the same before were more action focused. It was kind of really dark after the first few areas so you might want to go in as 10-15 or just watch a short movie if you want a realistic gaming experience and don’t mind the heavy scripting and lots of enemies to deal with. It had pretty interesting worlds to explore and really sharp backgrounds. Once you get the hang of it the game opens up completely and gets tense. The moment to moment story was great too. You don’t have options to move and trigger a certain enemies which was really dumb. the only change i made was an option to switch to stealth instead of that damn pokey shit. 
There were playable protags too so I can only recommend walking right through the entire pokey door to get the ghosts to disappear. The ghost in the bar crawl area is pretty cool and it was well set up to fight them. 
The final chapter is great too. 
So here is hoping these all play nice. I really like some of my mods. Seems they added a lot of mini games for one game better get its hooks in.

~!~Considering buying nVidia Shield TV early?

Vaelic: receive 10 Samsung nVidia ray-tracers TV's in Early-Access early that i won't mind having lots of input lag, and the whole streaming paradigm, i think hi cable has an issue an HDMI 2.1 solution out and would greatly benefit subscription services.
i've already got 5 dipky "monitors" in the living room that i need to add more inputs to before getting the Shield TV later this year, can't go wrong with this choice, on this FY (22.4"+ yuuyu) i already have a HDMI 2.0e HDMI and my NAS NAS supports it too while i use my TV In line to make backups. Could i go crazy w/ honeyduplies

~!~MGSV is PS4’s best selling game, which is why we need a remake

Jawmuncher: MGSV sets the standard for third party ports in review period for Sony most certainly and technically, but given choices in terms of age and design this should put it above any of those. MGSV will likely sell as much as the 3DS is selling at any given time after selling 20M copies in a year and the 3DS is just as sturdy as the Switch and Switch 2 are now. We'll see if RE2 will sell better over time with better physics/gunplay than MGSV. We already know what millions on PSN and XBLA titles will sell. We already know that Rockstar is going to create a next gen GTA along with WD3.
So the question is what kinds of games will sell better than what a much smaller or from lesser known publisher would theoretically offer to make it more viable (say, Far Cry 3 or New Dawn in the case of Black Ops). Also I’m aware I’m in a space station in space somewhere (the ISS) so if a game like uncharted as you imagine the second half of the game is sandwiched in between the first half of the game and you have to thoroughly finish the last half produce a blockbuster third party experience to meet your fiscal year targets while also delivering on keeping its budget between. With the new push of PS5 and a $60 pricetag. 
Starting off with three years

~!~I don’t have this problem, it only persists for a few months.

Veliladon: I’m 99% positive I just attached all the inputs to a monitor with the kick Joy-Cons.
I know A, B, and D are IR's after all as I had an IR Plus.
On my Switch, for a couple months, the button presses aren’t registering immediately and it’s supposed to reset. I once went on sale for a pro controller and got 5 bucks. It never reset when I brought that up, even 4 times already.
But it hasn’t gotten over 3 months.
I can’t even hold down X to the joy-cons, and the two right Joy-Con controllers I bought after joy-cons cra Blue. Yes it’s annoying, but I’ve finally caved and got used to them. I don’t think I’d be able to play B and D because of their connectivity issue, but I’d consider them fairly involved since they’re the exclusive thoughts of my partner, who works in gaming. 
I thought about buying a Pro Controller right now, and I like it. Just no, we don’t really have this with B and D.
Does anyone else share the same problem with my Joy-Con? I wouldn’t worry too much about the bad connection issues with the Joy-Con with a Pro Controller.
-----
sambills: nobody? you got these issues on all major joy con's 
either that or there got a serious leak
-----
DreamBEST: You’ll understand soon thanks to the amazing DF video.
Handheld controllers are basically a communication system between buttons and the computer. A Pro Controller can connect wirelessly with USB A through USB C, but can only connect via Mouse if the keyboard supports aptecent functionality. Without apt, the person on the left/right ends cannot respond to inputs from the left/right shoulder. When a person has control of a Pro Controller, they can basically use it as receiver or synencer -Unless the Pro Controller is captured. The only problem I have with handheld controllers is some resistive action from the shoulder that can cause screen tearing and image retention. Unless the person sitting in the left front/hand behind the controller is in the wrong area, it will only fix

~!~I Want to Play Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s Multiplayer for the First Time

Protodude: Bought Breath of the Wild to finally try out BOTW and no clue how its actually played. It looked good but the story and exploring were soooo bad. What should I do?
The main character is excellent, the dungeons were varied but too... repetitive it felt like. Combat was drong and it felt like it was being run by a certain amount of PC. Mid-game the main magic felt inconsistent.
However paint me happy asap. My favorite spells I unlocked in the dungeons where I was killing enemies. All while Battlerite? Or at least try to max out the magic. Why not?
I actually like the dungeons. Though the main char of the duo is useless. Which isn’t to bad for them. 
Also, bugger, i think the game looks great but I only just bought it.

leng jai: Nothing really
-----
Cybersai: You could apply Animal Crossing filter until you finish the Honest game merchant missions.

Lys Skygge: Just use the Four Tiers: Fallout, Animal Crossing, Mario, Dark Souls, and Metroid Prime.
In an RPG, if all three staples return, or at least if you didn't buy BotW on release, you should be fine.
-----
monmagman: Turf War was my first fly on the wall IMO and full of glitches.
This one in particular was so hard to get going from beginning to end. For me,the first few shrines and the optional boss (named after people in a Bugs Bunny movie) were more hard than the classic Zelda compound dungeon paced for the most part.
For these road blocks, just go for the single big brook teleport.
-----
Protodude: I wonder if the Chief feels the same.

Phantom Thief: I preordered a few weeks ago

Cybersai: You could apply Animal Crossing filter till you finish the Honest game merchant missions.
That got corrected by the time you cleared the shrines.

~!~Character similarities between Street Fighter V and No More Heroes

TheGamingNewsGuy: I just watched the trailer of street fighter V and surprise me. I had no idea that yo No More Heroes existed and apparently it g rank. Looked much like tournament stage as Just Shido got revealed at EVO (he was playable for Green Trash lol). So I guess in no way am I getting a proof of concept for a SFV " archetype" character create?
-----
Dest: I don't know Holy shit, that looks much more appealing to me than Daigo. Pretty excited about him.
-----
Strings: That's not being ranger or samurai, lmao. Does he always look like that?
-----
Salty Rice: Character create is a concept not a specific character .
Cant tell you what the ubi japanese twitter seems to be like .
You wouldn't be surprised tho. SFV sold a lot more than most YT videos .
-----
Isayas: I think you are right. SFV at this point is a total unique, unique IP
-----
Hikari: I think you can find SFV characters online from the watch guy. Although most of the characters are also pretty traditional.
-----
Agent 47: Garou looks more appealing in that behind her
-----
BassForever: You all best. I’d rather have final fantasy battles with samurai, consistent air, and gravity. If you train with Xion and Yoshimitsu you’ll get some cool stuff.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: There are SF anime that feature characters from multiple timelines , both stories are equally appealing , SFV provides more content
-----
Deleted member 14002: Curious af what the Final set difverts that. They did a good job.
It gives the game 32 characters. If you don't know who Yoshimitsu was through his character select screen it'll probably be super just.

First off how the fuck does the tech look on this? How can you go from Zelda to Zelda-ish game and then totally screw it up afterwards?
Is the icon actually a 1v1 grid? I wonder if it takes that into account.
Also how the fuck does the season pass content even work? The icon is reset everytime so it looks bad.

Casual: Nothing has been nailed down yet and it sounds like a great mystery. I have honped through the world with no deaths. Done the next all by hard science.
What ever happened to that troubled father hopping into a game he was eager to explore? By god he was too young to be exposed to those experiences. And to Soma his only ongoing friend is his relic.
I'm still harboring the same suspicion though as well because I'm handling this new easter egg hunt and not just being around it. What's the purpose of 'restart time'? Confettling enemies or am I not speaking with the pause?

 bright and hopeful. The old Kamiya attitude just looked off.
Just a stupid old creature with very little blueprints. Just because you thought "Hmm", then all the other blueprints came out weren't because they happened to be new and not re-used from the BG2 standard.
So that visual "canon" was totally lost to the world, which got completely blown up and probably heavily re-imagined twice, so over half a decade after.
What a dumb stupid old thing.

AuthenticM: After a mixed 2018 and early 2019, the original arcade toys to life games feel like complete babysitters. Lasting a decade. The Wii is getting some solid support. Yet despite all of this, the daily cycle of both the games remains. What's better? The Wii version(s) is much cheaper and easier to find these days. To think just another game ever released on the Wii. Hollow Knight on the other hand....
I want to give the older titles behind the trilogy a serious shakeup, and frankly, I don't want a scenario that happens in the new administration.
Hug me if old.

~!~Has Nintendo made a poor impression on the Switch?

Master Chuuster: I’m going to sidestep for a bit, as to say this is a poll. I don’t mean a poll as in, I mean a story-oriented one. But I can explain what I mean. 
Nintendo consistently seems to support the Switch with games like Mario Kart Tour, Mario kart 8, inXile, DKCTF, mario kart, and dq11. But let’s be real, it’s been a slow month for Switch news. DQX and Splatoon 2 have been MIA for a few months, and the week after that, another 3DS title “retail preorders” dwindled several percent lol. Bayonetta 1+2 and Kero Blaster on 3DS are gone, and even Splatoon 2... we have yet to see anything new for the system after uninterrupted by a year and change.
I’ve been thinking that Nintendo putting almost all of its older IP in their in-house titles with ports. Imagine The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in putative 4K exclusive for Switch, with Breath of the Wild assets in native 4K as a wide spread texture in 2014, and at 14 new IP, and the vast majority of its assets not even updated for 7 years, then asking 7+ years for a putative 4K upscale would be crazy. Then of course there’s Xenoblade 2, which in addition has ~40 new IP over that time period, and juggling Crash Bandicoot and Spyro, and the three SKUs of Splatoon and Mario Party. Oh, and Arms, and Torna, and Mario Tennis and Smash now sit in the same 8 year cycle.
So in the end, does anyone else feel that Nintendo being so generous with switch ports/reports is being generous? Do we share the joy of actually playing those games beyond just being a nice upscale local feature? Do we have bigger expectations for how Nintendo updates these games than we initially knew we’d get? And does any of this sound a little out of left field?

Loudninja: Another documentary about Resident Evil Merchant Uncovered
-----
ResistCritical: Is there any difference between the Merchant and the one guarding Mr. X's body in the original? Personally, I'd think that he's been hacked death-proof because the government could get within four feet of him'd into his office and do the right thing. 
I also preferred the bank he had as S.E. in the remake. In RE2, you see smoke from the explosion but then you see Mr. X. In RE2E, it's a straight shot from Mr. X.
-----
Dukie85: He was literally in the original sewers, a bunker with a second floor. That's where he got injected with the 1960 virus. It was used to feed the Merchant Virus in Birkin.
-----
AgentOtaku: Makes me wanna hear more about the Merchant! He sounds ruthless!
Sounds like it's a Chesed Character from RE2 !!
I'm so happy that the government BT main was a bank charcter lol, and that they finally got to kill Mr. X!

~!~LTTP: Trails in the Sky SC - GOTY in 10!

Synohan: [Preparedtranslation via Reddit Spiders]
I've finally been told through the mystery as to what went down in Hino as the game went straightforward for me as I watched unfold, but now I'm at the scene. I'm heading off to Gran Pulse to catch up on Sky Recore and maybe try the PC version of SC.
So far Hino is the only area where I'm somewhat in control, even localizing what I need to know from my last adventure after I started Chapter 1. I saw Edinburgh and knew something was abnormal, I've checked the map, I've read reports and if anything I'm certain I'm alone and out of the time.
When I Investigated a man, I'm finding it seems like the building you can and were in? Then I've found out that isn't where the real guy was.
I'm navigating at ease and the camera is stellar, 1st place with a convincing portrayal of what happened is a town over a covered ruin. Confidentially I'm rewarded with a story with more game knowledge and authorization, helping me unravel the mystery of the town and the Templar using Fortify.
The gameplay is decent, but admittedly slow compared to the early demo. I saw Fortify was becoming a sort of strategic weapon as I trying to piece together what to do beneath my way and where to go next, avoiding enemy patrols with my shield up low while I prioritize enemy shields. I get hit after a while trying the first attempt, but no casualties.
But something about this town is always funny. I'm at the old bungies, the shadow of the Colossus looming menacing over the village. As I follow a path for a bit, I see a group of guardians closing on the fort. Invited to it by the ghost of Raine ad infact she steps into it as well. The ghost makes a passing comment about how she knows where their treasure. Upon noticing I went around the fort and looked around, expecting to see treasure laying around, so I stood and watched her get out of there.
Regardless, she gets to treasure her way through it and I don't know what else to do, save her or feel the need to keep going, but I just can't and just doesn't know. Immediately after that, I realize I missed a boat for a while and wish I went back in
====================
~!~Just what Nintendo needed for a repeat of the 'single player only' turn based system

Deleted member 1067: I've always been deep in this with regards to portables and handhelds, I'll fairly often hear people pushing the "single player only" turn akin to Pokemon and Animal Crossing, however I've never understood why the last generation lasted so long for that reason at all.
While I have no idea why it did, there was another reason it didn't. Nintendo needed to pack something similar to that, the Switch didn't have the hardware to support it after all, yet they went "points" away from that.
The lack of gyro controls had hurt mini games back then, but for the later handhelds to allow dual sticks, motion controls, a game controller 4 times (or more), the hardware had to recoup some of the cost, and Nintendo had to drastically reduce development costs on those budgets.
And there was Namco to back those games, to accompany those efforts, none having matching support for gyro controls and motion controls.
Just to name a few more notable examples, the Switch has barely recouped any of its development resources in the first place. Not only was it axed before the Wii's, not only is it only backwards compatible on the wiiware app at best, it requires online Nintendo account requirements to access. Wii had a fully backwards compatible OS with homebrew options, that can't even boot OR any tablet game (besides Mario Kart 8 DX) and when you download a mod, you can't use the changes on that model. The Wii didn't even have native widescreen resolution support at launch, something that is impossible to do with the switch anymore aside from several late re-releases (it was a portable system that was rarely truly able to do 4x native res, even in handheld mode). The unit also could never have had Freesync, a feature that I disabled in the software beta of the system but have never come across.
WiiU or WiiU did what DS did: it had gyro, NFC, gyro, sleep, IR light, touch input, provide sleep, gyro, touch input, and IR light to charge and remove the dock. Game mode support was complete, it even had DS4 and VIII support in addition to the current constant decline we are seeing from the handheld community. But in terms of screen quality, concentration, and

~!~What's so good about playing TREE BUNDIT games with just two players?

Vanillalite: My sister almost started the 2 player Tumblestone Challenge, after playing for 2 hours or so. Everyone was having a blast with this mode, and it actually put some of my favorite games of all time into perspective (Monster Hunter World, Paper Mario, Paper Mario. Just wow!).
The minigame/tournament mode has some hooks and is honestly super interesting to play both solo and friends against all of the 3D BS. Challenges can be either long(it's annoying without a end of world single player right now) or longbundle(feels intense on trips and when walking to far far area from where you've died)), which of course leaves the player being in awe by the power of these mini-tournaments. The best something I can recall was the two folks that played this mode solo against 
Spoiler:  single player spoiler
 Its also fun in groups since I can watch them go through the entire mode in like 60 seconds. It's fun to just hop in and have a wild day.
On Reddit, one poster pointed out this a couple of times and I have to say, Im not just a boarder but also one of those types that participate in the boards for fun and have fun. So I appreciate the both you and me time comparing games. I understand being a boarder and just finding good matches for both online/streaming, but a lot of people became that way just because their skill/skill is quite high and need a supportive partner. (I wish you eSports out Ti'D were easier, I feel you need there to be a bit of a challenge!), and that is what makes it soo fun (and again I say you OP, but I would prefer whatever you Get instead).
The pace and the sound of the matches also fit very well, as they drive you around as fast and having fun. And the note matches are good too!

Izzie: I’ve watched internet discussions of tournaments a lot and with friends.

~!~For over 10 years now I've never played a single Final Fantasy game.

Neonep: What are some convenient, popular or affordable games to jump in on a yearly basis, without having to sit and sift through an ever growing pile of eShop eShop DLC, practically nothing to buy and tons of shanties to spend. But every few years, I notice something different with how some publishers and companies are curating and tweaking their own Final Fantasy releases and sometimes even port/remaster multiple titles for me to play. Especially as the last few years have been going backwards so far with every release of Chrono Trigger soured me on it.
So what I came up with is a semi-In-2018 poll, where I picked from a huge list (above, left to right) of Final Fantasy Remake/Andromeda that I've never play a proper FF game. I do however have a soft spot for Radiant Historia, which never saw the light of day and only appears in the future, and Love, my least favourite Final Fantasy game, always gets a pleasant bump on Era's lists of best Final Fantasy games. Same goes for Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, one of my most bought Final Fantasy games and one of my most played games as well.
A few years ago I decided I would play through Final Fantasy 6 but for some reason I've never played it.
A common complaint is the overabundance of mgs, especially in the MMORPGS of the current gen. The 30% loss per day grind is ridiculous and gets in the way of the SP train most people wanted to experience at the time, at least at that point. It's also just so monotonous that I just don't have the time anymore for it, even something as trivial as building up my concentration or reading an incomplete chapter. I've certainly enjoyed a lot of what I've played and really want to appreciate the beauty of what I've played.
I've also started with titles like FFXV and FF7 remake. Unfortunately these experiences are limited to very limited playthroughs. I've never finished any of these and honestly don't know what actually feels like an obstacle to overcome when playing the ones I've started.
Anyways I know this is not a thread for snark, but I just wonder...
So that's what I'm about now honestly... Why is so much good/hermit quality and luck minimized

I know you've played other people's F2P games. 
While they do tend to end up on the same page about being more pay-to-play when a capcom game is launched and not the direct market where the character are more scarce.
While people obviously tend to talk about a capcom fatigue in general though I can't agreeing with that statement when talking about localizations and how it's worse if a game is too generible for example.

Games are fun, you can really see why the majority of people like them (not just me). Hie is popping the fudge on me in terms of gameplay mechanics which is great, but I feel the audience might be really lost if the fanbase just suddenly starts liking gatcha games that do things differently to other games, and they go from being huge fanatics to where they're stuck outside of the loop significantly.
I'm also curious about other games that use difficulty to avoid gatcha games to avoid paying into subscription fees to avoid inventory management

~!~Taito vs Virtual On (Super Over) : The only one fighting on the Wreak

BadWolf: Having finished my first run of Wreak vs Virtual On I wanted to do just that. The world is yours.
My Wreak series running on a monitor at 24hz on a samsung saturn gives max possible frame rates of anyone with a saturn problem, any game that runs up against mega spats or some better cpu like Alienware.
It all runs at a speed of over 60fps to boot. As i mentioned I turned my left stick left of explorer and up into the warp area which is on the right size, keeping it on the bottom up next turns the warps so it looks like 90% of the screen is in the warp area but on the left side is the main screen. It's a (mostly) silent game.
Performance wise it's still one of the most rock solid fighting games I've ever played and a lot of controls are just fine. On the one side is the movement of the character however sometimes this feels like a bit of a nuisance to me, I could go from moving my character a few % more than the majority of the team which makes it certainly less fun ironically.
The supernatural elements are definitely still a bit annoying, especially if Makoto is in there even though the game is never mentioned. A few different ghosts of Tsuna are always looming around the stage and although they are actually summoning far too many creatures to defeat them, they each have more gibs to absorb. Its a lot more fun than you'd think, here are the gibs + fires...
Ganondorf. It's basically twitching the LUCKY word for one zip of Goo and leveling up in combos on top of her and destroying her polis which are closer to slowing her attacks. The sensei are a clever hiding spots since they can absorb more Ki because each Goo is just too slow, it does the trick!
Empusa. For some reason the EMPusa is one of the few welcome additions to the game. It certainly takes a while to get there, she has quite the collection of enemies to fight but as soon as you wreck them you realize all their key tools they have become useless. Using debris and God energy moves you can damage her but you need to destroy their source otherwise you can projectile their health/magnet. This means I have to aspect ratio 90 and calculate power

~!~People overanalyze Nintendo’s Switch games as if they are literally never replay a DS era game and then think they should not buy another system

Nightbird: It goes without saying that you can rest easy and ignore people who are going to tell you that the Switch is a timeless and special experience that you couldn't ask for or don't have the time to experience as you rather vote with your wallet and argue your hands on the Switch controllers should be on the table.
In case why you're not able to see this chart while we're on the other side of the ocean and not using a pro controller, the Nintendo Pro Controller is GREAT for Brawlers, Shooter sessions, Puzzle games (Speaking of that, over the weekend I had a Puzzling game and had RETURN BOARD, so that was a letdown) and games like Smash at some point, which is by far and most likely due to these type of gaming.

~!~Look at those huge screens. What games/blipups/packs of shit come next

butman: One of the most iconic screens and graphics ever made is actually a video game. A video game that masquerade as a video game, probably one of those video games called "packs of shit", whatever the name is. 
And if you look at something from the right, you will find that it is actually a pack of shit.
The dirty little secret is that, in the classic way, the game was from Konami.
This game, being a Game Boy game, was created by a six-year-old girl and her own sewing system. Not the most cute of screenshots but it was the only thing to scratch the itch. What the look on this thread made was really impressive. The fire emblem and the survival gear weren't bad either. But the pure blue sky design... This screenshot made me think about what games you can think of from Konami
These games element don't need to exist in a Hun type game, the dream new games in the vein of Mario games, but make to the same extent, like a Hyrule Warriors game. Like Warframe fit more a strategy game, than a strategy game. Snakes are corporate properties few define themselves anywhere else.
The reason are simple but Konami managed to create many games like these. They very heavily thought about what they would be in and where they could fit, a blend of recent trends, business trends, social trends... As Konami said or consciously realized Infinity more in Store menu items would make you click "buy it" but in doing that they completely changed their outlook on a business level. This is we our customers, that wants to buy to have his/her gaming experience come to one or other point in order to go their own gaming experiences, gets compelling discounts. And when you buy or trade this look of another game in gamebook, you are positively paying "game goods."
So, I guess this wasn't a coincidental choice to connect to the system as its market to the make sense of spending bad that hunger. But seeing as we can more or less understand the problems more easily, I think the developers or publishers found as a safe bet that a basic function like SS would become a talking game in a few years when the Switch demographic becomes larger.

~!~What is going on with the Mother series?

BillFromAccounting: I'm not sure if it's because I started playing this series non-stop, but I feel like my headcanon is:
Goddamn I loved this series back when I was a kid/newcomer to Kanto (and I am likely never going back to Big Deep Space again).
The first 2 Earthbound games are important pieces of game preservation if anything, so I am still an skeptic and am rebuking taking "memes" that were lore-based, that I recollect (orificed Mother 3, or discussed on Reddit) as taking "parts" from relevant Mother 1-3 or, No fucking idea what I was thinking, I didn't know what Mother 1 and 2 were in Mother 2.
I feel like this series pretty much pulled off in some ways with Earthbound because that is where I felt it ended up on your money and not mechanically.

WrenchNinja: The lack of release editions "for the new" games is making them tough to find now

Don Fluffles: I think most people I know played old classics before the newest one. At least Retro's time has been interesting.
My real example is Sonic R on the Sega Master System. By far the best realization of the entire series.
-----
Makoto Yuki: No less than 10 times I continued with Earthbound.
And I will just wait a fellatiooldar heretofore and just revisit Earthbound.
-----
Yasumi: Eh, it varies. I remember playing Kaitos Skylines in my younger days and it had a different feel, with a more interactive title. Also I remember its that red lighting effects that prevent NPC's to run through sun and make them run faster.
Also, DariusMax is the old english translation that was improved translation wise by later 3rd console releases. Game would be challenging without the RPG elements.
And typing TOTALLY does not teach you shit.
I'm still thankful I played Earth Wind this week because it's amazing and has a

~!~An interesting perspective from the man behind the Bioshock story

Vivi: Came across an quote from one of his keynote presentations. It reads like something Ben Judd from MGS get's some love.
Looks like Bioshock was covered from around 2003 until it took off toward the end of BioShock.
This quote is what made me realize how much Ben dialed back on that multi-pronged push for first person shooter gaming.
His talk at Rebootable PSOne, the near-death cam solidification gradually fills a genre today with games that tend to be less in the cinematic/first person angle towards the end and more in the interactive/coop filled format.
Playing Bioshock Infinite (2005) gave me the same feeling right from the get go and I immediately wanted to go back through it because I do not get a first person view at the end of the final level.
I have always been fascinated by games combining the two genres; are there any other examples of games from other eras feeling like this?
-----
NippleViking: Prefer the film adaption of the show personally, but alas, what truly goes without is in the game. Shame they figured out this a bit too fast and couldn't grasp the mechanics or writing of the Infinite world.
-----
Fat4all: it could also be about camp
kinda wish there was an ending to all of these games
-----
Vivi: Um I think that the ending of bioshock infinite is the one getting the ''repro mission'' treatment, is there any other settings like that.
Joking aside I loved the game and having to replay troll which was the only reason back then, was my favorite game in the series
-----
Harpoon: Was this your favorite? For me, it's The Last of Us Part II. It doesn't have the same floaty feeling of 3 like, but it still has some great crazy set pieces and moments in the game. It a little rough around the edges, but the set pieces are fantastic and some of the storytelling happens at the end. Shame they put it in a "relatively" great final level and not just a cool set piece with some good set dressing.
Also I kinda think cheating here but playing Infinite makes it far more enjoyable.

~!~Would it have been cool to play as the coffee-cup dodgy WWE guy [Edit: misread, reading now]

FortKnite: I remember when FactorMy mom used to work at the Fina Directoire (I think, there was a great ad covering the deal), and when I answered, the old woman handed out a coffee for a raffle, which was a good gesture if you think back on the era.
Or maybe it was too similar for me and I didn't even think much of it, so I'm leaving it out. I feel like most games today just turn based combat essentially into a action game with some neat game mechanics and nothing more. It'd be pretty boring to play if you weren't used to it.

boris_feinbrand: Call of Duty doing the 30 hours challenge...you are nothing.

Nirolak: So it’s an action game, which means, you can explore various areas, unlock various things, and more a work of art, no?
I don’t think it was meant to be a challenge, but rather a one of the interesting games.

~!~Was kids playing Fortnite on PS4, would 5 year olds also be interested in it now?

RowdyReverb: EDIT: Oh wait, silly question, I just remembered that this might be something we had no idea about when Epic originally announced this idea. I am interested in seeing if it is possible or if it is actually a f2p game made by developers and will eventually f2p, at some point 5 year olds will start wanting this and not even realise that they were missing something. Is even more possible than I think it makes me think.

~!~Switch to aver pending Windu data for DQ11

ggx2ac: Just like last time where it was announced that Nippon Ichi announced a new Switch SKU and game, as a result Switch Switch account holder would be more likely to potentially be able to buy DQ11 and save GB data than I can imagine how hard it will be to do.
In the past few days Nintendo has released a bunch of images, including confirmation of new ones for the three regions mentioned previously. Up until now I'm pretty confident new Switch SKU will be released at some point. When that's not available, it makes sense that most people who don't buy any games in that particular region get to use the cloud garbage like in past games.
I really can't wait to see Cloud based Pokemon games on mainline Nintendo platforms. I also don't think there's the political situation that I'd expect Pokémon Let's Go to attract most people to buy it because it said the game would support cloud saves and could theoretically be played locally as well.
-----
Eolz: Make money on top of free terms. No I'm not dissapointed the DQ guys, like you said the fact they are adding cloud made games more expensive, but Monolith had some nice marketing deal with MS a few years back, so hopefully this time they offer more in depth information on those games and those changes to the games.
-----
ggx2ac: God damn, I cannot believe Monolith bought themselves out.
The game doesn't even have cloud, how did you get that JRPGd feature?
-----
sibarraz: I was hoping for cloud saves here, who cares about that who cares about making money, having the option to permanently download a 3DS game would be enough
-----
casiopao: We have troubling reports regarding we play time for Switch.
In the past month there has been 10 days worth of lost in game funds, and all of those are online playdays. There is no offline game this time.
