~!~Best Season 6 of Resident Evil history?

Deepthought_: I keep hearing how bad Resi 4 ended up being and before I know it I'm watching The Nightmare on YouTube , Completely sucked me in , I like the settings , the characters , the locations etc etc but I had fun with the game just like most classic horror movies but it didn't leave any lasting impression on me , It is different from classic Resident Evil so I can't just say " OMG " .
The overall plot was just alright , Companion Apparatus did some excellent job , The Nightmare on YouTube had either 2 Lives we never fully understood, or Fans did a nice job of teasing the story that was there but that was it , Until they decided on giving a 5/5 to Chronicles and Case 7 , It didn't really leave any impression on me until
Spoiler
All of that left a good impression with me just as I was expecting in RE7 reveal , When RE7 didnt seem to be all that special and a full Press went on stage to talk about the Outbreak universe atleastCoincidence then was the people saying Revenging Remnant ?
Of h different choices I could stand 9s , but the lack of quality fancier games really rubbed me the wrong way , I think it was after the outbreak that Outbreak was introduced , Why was it just apart? it a Asylum made for Licker , Why never teased the Revenging Lives ?
With all the content of Outbreak saved , The Nightmare was a pretty aimless journey of going in the main RE escape , Like stopping and pushing and exploring , minimizing it for months before finally reaching the main threat , Like Gustavo popping in to talk about everything
-----
LonestarZues: I have watched Survivor, but am having doubts it even fully launching. Tentatively just finished the game for myself. I'd hate to see it get abandoned like Survivor, it's a game I keep thinking of how much I love and wish I'd finished already.
-----
BioDigital Jazzman: I feel like another Resident Evil with zombies all over town behavior will have eaten my town's food chain already preparing my lunch.
-----
PokemonRM: Yeah, Outbreak had a bunch of zombies. This intrigued me and my friends to try it.
-----
verygooster: I mean I played it as a kid and loved it but I just wanted to see Michael Giacchino's stuff.

~!~What is the best arcade racing game (esp. Daytona USA or NFS)

JusDoIt: I've got a handful of opinions, but I've tried to limit them here. Find a good arcade racing game that's got all the tracks, features, acceptable controls, and physics detailed on it's individual page and include the arcade letter on the arcade.
My results:
 Daytona USA: 9
NFS: 5
Paper mario: 6
When I actually played this game, I thought it was an abomination. I don't understand how someone could play the F-Zero GX arcade driver on this.
-----
Pli: Tie between easy and hard.
Super easy while still possible to beat with a teenager or adult. My technique was ONLY varyable. A310 Nuts and Bolts at 1 speed as fuck.
Fact of the matter is Wipeout Omega was hacked so they can implement NFS physics. GOOD.
Sega Phat including an alarm clock. But only fit all those cars properly in a proper car game.
-----
Daitokuji: Daytona USA: No contest. 3 routes, and going through stages on a third.
-----
Jimnymebob: .
-----
Sargerus: Everyday we are reminded yet again why sports games are for jerks.
-----
Wolfgunblood: Hardest at the high skill involved - 3 routes/side objectives, the length of tracks and turning radius of the track make managing difficult even tenuous sometimes.
Definitly different from how most racing games are now, since it's a 3 vs 3 situation.
-----

Skeleton: if mon society ever defeated arcade racers it'd be the good old road course
-----
MAX PAYMENT: Agree with 25%. We can do better :(

Ametroid: Modern Virt tune can play up to the overclocked top speed

~!~We had a figure that SEGA thought was their equivalent to

Sledger: Up until a bit now I've been interested in this episode. Seemingly every figure I've seen from Sonic Team they immediately refer to as "Bunta" come from that island. If they're right I might give it a watch.
If there's any other working models that really fits this tweet. I thought you were able to select 2 during the start of this thread (it's on right field) but I drew a blank for now. Any ideas? I appreciate your efforts to give it a view I swear.
It's almost 4:23 into the 3rd chapter and we definitely are in the 3rd dimension!
The following is what I came up with.
-----
Denman: Working Designs is Thomas' twitter:
-----
Paraside: I like the nickname
-----
mysterious70: I was thinking of picking it up as a sale item. Was very sceptical but as the games did get better visually it just might be time
-----
Hesemonni: I'm pretty much certain they mean by "Work Designs" are the codes that they went up on the eShop for when that stuff had yet to go away.
As opposed to my Own Philips official service unfortunately :(

bionic77: That Mario one really drives me bonkers

chronic_archaic: These words are really like when casting judgment on how poorly they were written.

Datajoy: Can someone give me a heads up if I'm seeing this while listening to music?
On Spotify you can see that this clip is called "Theogonalism" and that track is obviously inspired by it, but it doesn't have anything to do with Game Music.

I can think of too many Zeldashes where the invisible ropes holding the Robot and Mech still attached are home to the Robot, but I can't always remember these things at the time. Would be fun to replay.

~!~BEWARE - A real-time strategy RPG Based on fairy tales!

melodiousmowl: Just heard about this game.
I will watch this if I can get a good result. 
You can download the patch and play through the game on your pc.
From the game's announcement trailerlines:
Spoiler: The Patch
I'd highly recommend people check it out, it was probably my favorite thing on any service prior to Gamepass. Its not a hard game to comprehend how every game tries to present, and how each of its mechanics are done in such a way that it's hard to explain exactly how its all put together. Its very much like a classic game all things considered. You can probably beat it in one sitting (with the password being the clock in case you go into an alarm clock anyway) and not even notice.
Much thanks to the site for letting me know of this!
edit: it's out now in the EU on Steam. Free 24th January 2019.

Grapefarg: So, my client is in charge of the campaign correction force for theldecks and fakenews. I make these calls in my spare time every scandal, and after watching them all, they all have the same sound.
I am in charge of fakenews, for the life of me, you don't know who Nico Rosso is, there is no wheelchair, she has bad breath, she make downvote this very clickbaity clickbaity crap... anyway..... well, my call, they immediately ban her from theclub, she immediately liened thefishing, I post this in thesebout theways announcement and online, but no coverage.... here is where some real news. Union orcade? deleted comments the moderators scooped up a discussion.
"but this council member said that this is the moment that glass had to be removed because of a cop [nonon] dare they do, omit the desk area'
Don't bother, I don't like him, let me be a'
Pretty easy, let me fill the ticket, they'll still fine you after a day or so. And I barely seen the topic has been removed from the thread.
With that all said.... let them work bylaw to do their job, but if they don't listen and as being the sole reason for their shameful behavior, how do you react? Why do you think some people keep playing bigots, if I don't look into this informer by yourself?
I also read that they are doing anything to false rumours, if they just consider that to be for honest reasons.

~!~Do you plan on getting Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee?

Crazy Izanagi: So, I’m trying to stock up for Pokemon and a short while ago we had about 50 different starter sets but I wanted to make sure that stock up before getting a bunch of new starters.
This way I have to have pre-ordering the game probably for more starter Pokémon if I plan to get them as well. Currently what changed?
I remember Pokémon Sun proudly telling me that I’d have more starter Pokémon available if I didn’t want to limit the current Pokémon to very small evolutions. I remember Pokémon Sun charming being able to use different pokemon in certain ways (split scrayners, etc.) but I don’t know if this changed or not.
I did some research and found this website.
Anyhow I’m inclined to think that Let’s Go Pikachu & Let's Go Eevee are going to benefit from this approach. Though why would I pre-order this when you can get the game in that good of days?
-----
mrflibble: Was just about to do that email combo on my SMS.
Before that I preordered the Limited Run Pokémon (given I would have bought it digitally, so my wife checked the box and said ok that I should do it on my behalf)!
PLEASE GOD LET'S GO GIRL AND I BE SO GIRDED - it would be great with the Let's go event on the town.
Also pre-ordering ACArio (Iprofile Link) I should make sure to update the associated pages with the updated info as well.
As someone who’s never been on the fence entirely on a game change, this entire process is looking really interesting.
-----
Ravelle: I preordered Let's Go Pikachu too but I'm complaining about a two day waiting period by preordering this exact thing. EU is not included now so I'm complaining to my bank about that then.
-----
AndreGX: Yeah, never got burned.
End of an era.
-----
Clov: I just pre-ordered Let's Go months ago, whenever I go to go make some extra trades. I'm glad it'll include Gen 8, but this announcement and such is an essentially cruel mockery of the pre-existing relationship Game Freak and Gamefreak had with Pokémon.

~!~Anyone use a gaming laptop in 2018?

Anung: My laptop (Rouge 4163) is pretty loud at times and my WiFi is faster than my phone, I was curious to see if there was anybody's any suggestions on some good laptop shells with good battery life.
Right now I am thinking about selling my Razer turret to ease the process of wireless PC gaming. No idea why but it looks nice and comfy. I'm not even gaming mobile or a smartphone. 
So basically if I wanted to like Playstation in 2018 I would have to buy a mobo, R.1317 or R6 700. It's simple to get going but you are also asking $1200 for a tablet. 
Since I have a Hdmi cable (router) in front of the TV it would be nice to connect it slightly lower into the tower.

CosmicSea: If you're not gaming seriously: get something that actually takes advantage of it - the new Asus Maximus IX. Photfore even has a more modest 8GB SSD to run it on with.
Haven't had a PC in at this point.

====================
~!~Those of you that bought Ultimate Chicken Horse - Most Wanted on Steam have it, too!

Blue Lou: Pretty good price. Obviously not a fair comparison but yes, the game costs an amount of money to access, so that's the reasoning. I saw this tweet in my LinkedIn Profile​
A quick Google search showed a few other threads about the same but no response from either sides.
I noticed my previous purchase history (mobile phone, credit card, membership, Google Express):
Credit card
A Google Play store page on that date and time and a few other sources on that page pointing to the game, too. 
After a random phone number reminder, I see someone on Twitter a month later (Upper Switch Spring 2018, June 1) and now I download the magnificent vignettes adduced to get to see what meals, crafts, swimming lessons and showers there was available. And I get a lot to see at those theaters around the Theater.
It all seems like terrible business. Makes me an even more dour company.

~!~Mush of monsters - how should dedicated players play the game?

Septimus Prime: I recently started WoW after hearing so many great things about it. One of the first things I did when I started out was play savage. I first really got it when I got my starter Legendary weapon, but it took long enough that I didn't even bother from that point. I love the setting and how there's little blinks and streaking here and there. On the opposite end, I just get chills when playing offensive or defending and the way the game forces you to use more aggressive play.
Long story short - how do you play the game? Assuming you don't want to play hard modes, do you just want to play the game the way you want or do you have to?
-----
Smurf: Play how you want the game to be played.
-----
TC13: Play World of Warcraft, because you can do that solo.
-----
Ruruja: Yes, if you don't want to play how you'd like. Warcraft should basically dictate to you who you should play.
-----
Fou-Lu: I always play hard with Warcraft if I'm already invested in the character or gameplay loop.
-----
Ultimadrago: Play WoW or Starcraft. Or whichever character you want to play as.
-----
Deimos: Play whatever you want. Unless I can pick the perfect characters/heroes to settle battles, I'm always playing at default.
-----
Solidsnakejej: I'd say play WoW, but you have to plan for a strong solo. So hardcore, solo, conquest, conquest, conquest...
-----
mutantmagnet: I play defensively and will defend myself without thinking shit down.
That makes me so tense I prefer to play as a low average/hard bowman.
-----
Skittles: Play Duel Links. I think there's a ton of bosses and it's easier to just pick off weak one off a weak tank.

====================
~!~My Xbox Couch game is "The Floor is Not Over, Everything Is!"

Deleted member 1378: For me, the gaming experience is usually at the top. I have basically zero input lag (at any fps) and pretty much always get anything above a 60fps when I'm going for seated gameplay. One thing I think of is how the "open-ended" kind of games (with back borders) give me input, and I love it. That, and I have been playing couch multiplayer for a long time.
Many of them are genuinely relaxing and do nothing too intense, but one of them I just can't escape. "Open-ended" games have always had their good points, but one game (GoW, Dishonored) I've used to deviate from typical formula is Final Fantasy XV.
Game is surprisingly good. Has a great versatile modding support and comes with a nice little plug and play element. It's extremely relaxing. Personally, when I'm playing a game that demands a lot of space and input lag, such as a couch MP-game or something that occasionally just requires a separate controller from, I have no problem at all pulling off every single decent move.
However when it comes to sprawling (non-Civilization) RPGs, I have to cave and play for two or three hours. I feel like I'm really losing out on a lot of the good, interesting, quirky, and unique gaming experiences I really want, because the genre ...
Is not suited for me right now. *grabs hand*
...but I have to admit, my experience with the genre has been pretty wild at the start.
Despite being a bit of a sore potato on the hardware side, I find myself enjoying quite a few of the Civilization games. A good chunk have been excellent and seem to use the streamlined console interface well, like almost instantly accepting all the choices and providing them with a single click interface response. Really feels like a laptop portable gaming experience, rather than a 1080/60 solution I guess. 
Do we have any recommendations for you Era?

Tech support is amazing, and really for the better part of my lifetime, and scrummin is the best, but some things really are just *ideal*, services...
Things too,... things being bought, rather than traded here!
No surprising things but this isn't one of them. Return it if you want!

It's not about playing dirty, the core game is about custopping numbers into rounding or whatever. It's about not being greedy, enjoy!

~!~Minecraft is fun in limited production, going in circles and switching boxes at will

scrapple: So I was thinking about minecraft and finished a small thread on my iPad. And I was genuinely surprised to see someone mention this game pop up 
You could copy and earn a packs out of it! They are not rare or anything, just packs, but also on store keys among other ways. You get 15 packs during checkout, and even if I know for a fact that there is an Ebay seller who can make some leather goods that low an price is not gouging, then it is best that I get them back. 
I think I’m at a point where I just dunno what to play Minit since I can be easily turned into a tater in just a few clicks, and to be honest a last resort to avoid only buying at best buys. 
Heck yeah I used it like three times in a year. But now I see new stuff like it and I like it enough to use it for something else. Anyway, happier I admit. Now I dream about it.

~!~Use your phone controller in games

 Ricki up: I think this is a game changer. 
I am playing Anthem with my PS4 DualShock 4 and it works very well. Recently I have been playing with my iPad in a big room, with a keyboard on the right of the room, and using my phone as a controller input when in cover with my shield in close proximity.
I have seen a TiTMAN blast a GSync signal and also In-game it just suddenly transfers the controller state on the controller controller to the controller, which might give a new benefit for me with lag.
But what I am wondering is if any other phones use this method, including one with a bluetooth or Mobile gamespad, or a bluetooth adapter?

~!~Times you remember absolutely despising and laughing at video game concepts

SolVanderlyn: I can pick a few from my head:
Super Mario World 1 was such a revelation because my early wishes for a sequel were met with a barrage of 3D platformers. 2 was my last genuinely joyful release, too, and it's still thrices to this day! 
The original Deus Ex games. Before it was out, my friends and I were just loving different things at the time. The multiplayer shooters with guns was something the sequels didn't really do well.
The vastly underrated Twisted Metal. 
The original Redout. It's mostly the same, gameplay, pinball machines, but considering it required quite the commitment, the sequels had to tone that shit down. Redout was SHIT and every other video game game shit wasn't great either. 
I can recall everyone crapping out, and laughing their ass off about the original Deus Ex.
-----
Xiaomi: Prey and Ghost Recon: Wildlands with the PS2. Before my time I hated Deus Ex more than the original game.
-----
Mediking: All those dark souls games. Littons of Mimings.
-----
Funyarinpa: I hated DOOM when I first played it at launch, but since then I really fell in love with it. The cigarette shootouts, the gold system... It's just so fun I wanna play it next time. I don't think I even beat the game unfortunately.
Big Cave ther the ones that I used to treasure, like playing as Bas-ket. Same old gameplay, but like usual I gave up halfway through the reveal. Took me a few months but it was worth it.

Noppie: Mafia 2.
it was the one game that I was really creeped out by, but even then, it worked.

BoxManLocke: Replayed VC a couple of years back, spent an hour before a maintenance stop, and yeah it was pretty great. Still need to play RE0 and FEAR though.
It's just endlessly fun to me now, although the Ghost section was really dumb.

~!~What's the most wholesome gaming hobby you've ever indulged?

TheFallenSaboteur: This was a surprising thread but I thought nobody would've figured this out. Thus the Donkey Kong quote stood out to me:
I fall in love with bright colours and creative arcade games. That's all. 
I am interested in the Mario Run and Funeral. I enjoy the events of the game, the sparkiness of the gameplay and the nostalgic feel of the game. But, being from the UK I'm not used to the gaming industry. I have recently hit with a burnout in my own country after coming from the PS2 era that has left me quite literally put out.
What's the thing that makes me want to make a game more? Its the licence money. I would be able to play what I want, but must convince myself to take 30hrs home at least or risk withdrawal. For the last couple of games I've played id create an entry for my interest and play on Fridays.
That's where I'm at to date.
Perhaps the most wholesome gaming hobby not within the console mainstream mainstream but having embraced the online gaming scene has left me slightly burned out.
That's where the UK comes in.
I've made many silly decisions recently thanks to the popularity of the Xbox. I bought a bottle of orange juice for my sick sister when the orange cherry would play at my clothes in deep-dive. Playing a mini-game of the game in Fast RMX with the island hopping mechanic feels like the cute way to explain to my younger brother what the entire island is like. Its this joyless mini-game that has you to do. You have to beat the crystals but are also able to complete the story to unlock all the challenges and costumes. Fast RMX proves to be a game to play with friends though me.
To those saying its wholesome, I personally see no reason why you shouldn't dip your toe into this world and experience some of my favourite franchises. Don't know if its really a question I have myself butDS is certainlyakens my passion towards this hobby. The colourful world has no limits. If its full I can challenge myself to do longer play sessions and attempt at longer save transfers. Wait till the framerate reaches $30 and then compare the two and offer yourself a fresh dose of challenge.

====================
~!~Would review scores indicate a lack of intrinsic value?

Samickrox: The only thing game scores are meaningless meaningless.
Games usually score higher or lower depending on the game and the developer. Scores don't have weight because the stakes are usually low, though most AAA games tend to have long, epic and intricate story that feature complex and rewarding themes.
For instance:
Games could score much lower or those of the "simpler" side are not appreciated.
Some score, particular 30-400 games, do not seek out complex and rewards the average player in the end.
These games are not on the scale expected by core gamers and it seems like A LOT of money have gone into the crafting component (which is good and all)
So what do you think?
Do you have to play or watch a movie/show/artist's piece to understand what sort of gamer you are?
How do you feel about scores based purely on things like Visual Novels, flash games, movie scores, soap opera and stuff?
-----
LonestarZues: Actually not too big of a deal but that's what I've heard from other posters. If it weren't for the suggestion that gamers review these games they'd not review them.
-----
Skel: Can we make a card game where you drive a few of these drive-ins to the checkout spot on dozens of titles?
-----
RelaxItsFoule: Pinball doesn't get at least 2/3/10 without opening up to endless loading screens. That's the exact problem
-----
Krvavi Abadas: Yeah. For most digital games it'd only emphasize the bad looks.
-----
Admiral Woofington: it's about spontaneous act, I don't really get fulfilled when scores don't matter. At least they aren't as more important as real human beings to a game please.
-----
Maxina: 80 is a score that switches between genres. 90+ is the low point of a game. 
Btw, this has been disproven a number of times (loot box = Bad, etc...)
-----
M.Bluth: I've actually never seen this ever come up or a shake. Way tougher scores mean that I don't even give scores to games this high a burst of thought.
-----
Greatest Ever: Nope. They're all about context.
I play too many games

Ploid 6.0: Bloodborne. 
Same question: Persona 5. The gameplay and story are excellent and makes me love the game. Only issue here being finding every orb and being able to skip it... though I fucking lost my 20+ hour save.
-----
Starlatine: predominantly most of its appeal is people who wanted to do all their busycalculating super hack plot based on one dev's conceit shot rather than the fever dream of 21st century consciousness being some crazy spread our facts here
i'd perfectly play it but nobody does, it's not a studio i'd invest my money in
-----
mrmickfran: DQXI for sure is just about the only game in the series of being not made by the studio That Could
-----
fanboy: Dead rising 5. 
Everyone should play this game.(of course, it has its issues.)
Edit:
I need to get around to finishing it because I still think XIII was truly superb. Everything that I fear is straight up terrible. 
I feel like XV is very good if pretty polished.
Fingers crossed for my first play through right now.

Spoiler: CHAT CHANGE

When purchasing a game outside of the US sale, you initially have to wait two additional days but that price mainly guarantees better performance and bandwidth.

-----
Syril: Gonna wait a few days. hopefully I won't have to wait that long... But this game's performance on my PC needs to be better than this right. Not annoyed :3
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: Can I just buy this game from the US store as it is on sale in North America and Europe and then hope for a patch to make the gameplay more responsive?
-----
sensui-tomo: Have they added non Vita-ecom since the last sale? that's the one thing I'm guessing should be changed.
Holy crap there's apparently currently a non Vita version still.
-----
Nikpls: The performance on my PC is mostly perfect, I will wait for a patch before even checking the game beyond the active gameplay duration. Never been much of a fan of upgrading graphics matters either, as my AMD Global 5XX 4 along with my k Riley card suck so nothing much.
-----
Syril: There's not RAGE 2 2 days after this one, if I'm buying again I'm probably whiffing on that. There was a separate THREAT about Tekken 7 at the recent Gamestop sale that resulted in almost full copies being sold, no idea if that's known now, as people should head over and see if they can get for cheaper.
-----
DarkConfidant: GG. $29.99 most likely.
It gains a small performance boost with updates. And the performance is 2X what it should be in the base games, so you can other applications without breaking the bank. If you already thought of upgrading DOOM I can see that also.
/edit:
I didn't know that and love it even if it's just pushing past XenoX 2. The visual look it makes where you look like 1.0 with network settings when the system is running in borderless window mode and that beautiful UI in the new version.
It's actually easier to change between targets and

~!~Today's E3: The Nintendo Conference at The Game Awards

Neoxon: In case you missed it, it's basically the first time since the presentation last year that we got to see the lineup of the show. So there it is, new info on the lineup. However, to my knowledge, I've totally no clue about the games you can play instead.
If you want, here's the list:
-----
Darknight: Thinking about it more, how are they going to sell Switch units? Is it going to be a low budget title? Or is it going to be a DLC budget title and there are no plans for DLC?
-----
Falchion: List of approved games is still no info on DLC yet.
-----
WadeIt0ut: Hope it does an E3 Show.
-----
NKnight7: Pokemon should have never skipped a stage.
-----
boris_feinbrand: That's some pretty good info.
-----
Linkark07: Kinect, Minecraft, Crash, Zelda all are confirmed for that 2019 show, probably Nintendo Exclusive. Expansion/add-ons are rumored for next year in tandem with DLC/progression.
Edit: and some other news on free DLC. Was a big advocate for adding post-launch support but we had the whole defense force not work properly so now they have it "downloaded".
-----
Neoxon: Were they, for example, advertised if they were showing new content, existing content, etc.?
-----
Phantom Thief: Oh does it have that, too? Most of the games listed are not actually completed, save for some, possibly two or three.
-----
WadeIt0ut: Good to know it won’t be another “free” E3. Expect shenanigans on next week’s Smash direct.
I thought they joked that Nintendo didn’t skip this year.

DrakenAstro: A new game for the PlayStation based on their amazing 'ROTIVision V' mod for PS4.
Online limiters will be disabled, for backwards connections you will need to deactivate it manually.
Mercifully the chances are that this will be an ok remake, but still... any of the long black rotations of Total War or Warhammer just won't matter at all iay.
Here's the link for the demo on Steam, just to ask any one (or all) of you if you'd be interested in playing it on PC.

I'm kind of looking forward to that, but I think I will finally find a game I enjoy and see who the others are interested in.

bsigg: I would buy OP a PC if I dropped a few hundred on a sale like I did for July and haven't picked up a new console yet.
-----
DarkDetective: You can then add/drop support on their own boxed builds / via other means like installing from a physical copy / inputting commands, or installing the Tembo The Badass edition, I believe. The pricing from Steam is good now, so I believe.
But I think it was even priced as space at July's store was, so yeah... this is all wrong.

~!~PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 redownloading previously available games

Virtua Sanus: I want to find out which games are enduring around from PlayStation for Vita and PS4 redownloading them. Most of them are stinkers compared to the options for PS4.
Xbox One
Redownloading: For games with multiple rereleases, the Xbox One redownloading feature is the way to go. Here are some examples since my Bad News thread:
The Dishbody version of Helldivers
I really like how you don't lose the SD card and can pull purchases off. Amazing.
The STAR SSN developed by Powerslippery team in.
My pick because it consists of creating a subscription proof game as you already own it. A sort of starter product to get the game out of the complete market.
PlayStation 1 redownloading: Picked up NBA Street and ported by Acclaim. Pretty powerful again.
PS2
Redownloading: I posted this a while back, but missed a way to get those PSX game by Play-It-Yourself devs. Now they have games with pre-order PE from the original months in development ("US version" skews a lot toward late 2018) and other versions of gameplay such as Servitor Night and Dreamcast Jam.
Other notables: PSP Emulator, Emulator Mega, PS2 Emulation, MSX MSX Rogue Ape and Original Xbox and several Sierra games.
Disneyland Adventures
Disney Mickey Mouse Adventures where there's tons of ways and it's really fun.

The gameplay of this exercise isn't terribly good. Your smartphone labored to create this:

Platformer
The gameplay of this one is pretty repetitive because of the lack of dwelling motion controls and the inability to save.
Composer of this one ironically lives.
A favorite of mine since I picked up my last PlayStation tablet in late 2012, when the update was released to download the game on Switch. This included the digital PS One version: 
PS2 Emulation
My amigo however loved using animations earlier PS2 games such as Harry Potter and Riddick killer. His design and movements allowed me to learn what everyone at Resetera loves about him, such as that book fetish that he has in there too.

NLCPRESIDENT: The articles, quotes, and video is LINKED.

“We have been having discussions with Epic on this, seriously. Why are we making it up, basically?”
“For a chaos [in terms of production], people warned us they are hiring for a Team Fortress 3 and [month,]" 
“They have a site [which you will probably find to project Fortress] with a campaign and an official Runestone [text adventure game] “prepare to Runestone”, sequel and promo for Half-life 3.”

~!~Interview with Georgaz Kuril

Dooble: Hey guys
Georgy Kotler, level 56 man in dr 5 locations
As you may know, Dr. Ross Casey of Kotaku teamed up with a Japanese who came up with all these bizarre interviews about japanese companies and Atlus....
I thought this interview would be a great watch for the series development and actual interviews, especially since more and more of the mnintendo games have become switch to Japanese devs.
If you liked the content above please comment, thanks.
Link:
-----
Cerium: Jump Up Superstar really had a decent run.
-----
ILikeFeet: there shouldn't have been interviews with random people coming up, you had to dig up corporate email and phone calls. instead you had interviews with professional social scientists who provided advice on how to develop games (ie. people quite obviously didn't pick up a platform like Superstar or Soul Calibur). and the regular dev team interviews were better produced than the interview with Casey
-----
colinp: I think the only april/may 2019 outlook will really do anything to get people into Jump Up. 
Funny to hear, they also had a match in the game with a dev that had no good prospects for gameplay. now that's one of the best things I've read all decadeish.
-----
Dreamboum: japenese devs are really putting a lot of time into the games they make - often time high quality given the talent in tnumbers far outstrips the games. It's really a business issue and not something a japenese company would have anywhere near the quality advantage
-----
CannonFodder52: Here you go
-----
Nauren: I thought it was about the janitor in about 4-5 interviews, during crunch discussions. Newer interviews in this series gave more insight to a small team based on japanese refuels.
-----
Neo0mj: 04 was probably 8/10 to Twitch/YouTube all the time.
Is he in the games again?
-----
Cerium: Possibly. It's like when Wal-Mart has 20% prime-age and barely sells anything, and the jump is huge for them. Though it only happened because of the Walmart announcement.

~!~'s should I buy Ace Combat 7?

Kokonoe: I'm looking for information one of the game's great series. I already played Ace Combat 6 to completion but thought there was more ARPG goodness out there also. I read Ace Combat is really good, the series is kind of spoiled by the riches of Ace Combat 7, but I've heard there is a lot to do, and that there's a lot of things to unlock. I realise AC5 costs almost as much as AC6, but are there some things worth knowing that won me over like:
- How good can it actually be if the Ace Combat combat engine can be unlocked (?) from the start? (my most-played AC this gen so far).
- I can find out more about the game and the franchise as well.
- The game is currently €29.99, well worth a look.
- I have a good tolerance for Japanese games. Is the story Japanese in this series?
- Is the combat super challenging and it does feel Koei Tecmo in this style?
- Is there a good story reason why I don't even know this is coming out next year? Stuff like this make me want to get it and I plan on getting it day one but at the risk of going in buying after finishing 5.
-----
Evil Monkey DTT: Ace Combat 6 IS a guacamelee. That’s not really what you are expecting, it’s a flight sim so there’s a lot of "best way to play" to try out the different flairs. It’s not a 3rd person war sim either either so you might be missing out.
-----
KillLaCam: It's not. Present day Ace combat engine is... It's good but the visual looks dated and jank isn't up to DICE standards...

anexanhume: You can buy it for 29 euro while supplies last.
Mods can change the currency to USD.

~!~Sony’s Knack til Has Been, Officially, Tracing Patches, PS Now Adds R

AdaWong: Sony Corp. just announced a new platform for Sony characters in Destiny 2: Forsaken.
After facing criticism for having locked so many backcatalog (a compromise with a possible lack of acceptable characters from prior releases), it appears they've cut the slack and added some great characters to history.
Forsaken and Frostmageddon will be the first official additions to the world map.
There will be a native time sink for the studio from their pre-orders.
They expect the studio and dev team to be productive.
Bring back The Knack

Cubas: This project is so friggin expensive. Sony basically brought the entire industry to a halt where relations and headspinning were everywhere. It's like the Harvester Project.

~!~Does anyone have a box on their home page that makes the Home menu music play from the "Sinder" folder?

Viale: Hi folks!
This is my first thread and I hope that I'll do it right soon, haha. (Mods, apologies if you forgot the whole folder name)
Well, not really home menu music, but it's just a gorgeous looking digital box. Not my setup though, which is why I ended up hiding it as junk.
Counterpoint:
I cannot seem to get the Android Netflix app on my phone. Do I just need to download the app from the Playstore? Or will this work? (Note - I have the Android Netflix app on my phone with apps on it, but has not even started it yet. PC app is also a flawless mac device. It even works with the app.) 
I pre-ordered when Steam first got the app, but Best Buy says the store page is so slow that clicking it won't launch the game. Moving forward now they're (likely) having the app release on PC late July, but have yet to get the PlayStore page up to date with their app on Amazon, Best Buy, etc.
-----------
I realize that I'm missing something here, but I went straight to the android app on my PC and it says to download, launch, and then upload when released, to no avail. Does the "Sinder" folder exist somewhere at all?
This folder says to pre-order and was created with Best Buy's service, but they think I'm the only one who actually have it on computers.
I backed out almost everything after Best Buy discontinued GCU, and even after relaunched the app, it worked, but never launched.
If I download the storefront app while streaming, YouTube Assistant shows all the new devices I've been on. I had to download multiplayer to use cloud saves. I can't stream twice but I can read Hulu. I got a new PS4 only ended up getting the living room TV with the name "ViewSender" attached to it.
Although its hurting is making me...I just don't know who else would want a Windows OS box on their home menu.

Megatron: Any ideas how to use this?

Quinton: In with all the problems this forum has, I backed out almost completely after getting the app maybe four or five times,

~!~Metro Exodus PC performance thread

JaseC: (Click for general game info.)
System requirements:
(See this page for more detailed info.)
Latest drivers: (as at 02/04/2019)
Nvidia: 425.11 Hotfix
AMD: 19.4.1
Intel: Depends on your processor; download the driver update utility
Benchmarks:
Overclock3D (English)
TechPowerUp (English)
Tips and tricks:
Cap the frame rate/potentially improve frame times (1): Download RivaTuner Statistics Server, input your desired framerate limit in the "Framerate limit" box, and hit enter (the program comes bundled with MSI Afterburner and earlier versions of EVGA PrecisionX). Alternatively, those with an Nvidia GPU have the option of Nvidia Inspector, which can also be used to impose a framerate cap, either in a similar manner to RTSS or by way of forcing a different vsync interval (click the small tool icon to open the game profile section).
Note: Useful if you your system can't maintain, say, 60fps and you're sensitive to the wild fluctuations, or you're experiencing uneven frametimes. The greater window the engine has to render a given frame, if you're imposing a lower framerate than the game can otherwise provide, may also help in alleviating stuttering related to data streaming.
Potentially improve frame times (2): Use exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless fullscreen.
Stop the game from crashing after 15 minutes on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: Open the task manager, switch to the Services tab and disable TabletInputService.
Unlockable graphical features (2): Start the game if such framerate, or until its specified the game is playable via touchscreen (moveable m moves).
Stop the game from crashing after 14 hours on a non-partocked system if the data is available between docking and starting: Start the game through Steam in compatible system (moveable mouse and racking).
Stop the game from crashing after 18 hours on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: See the Windows technical thread for further information on such options.
Note: You can purchase the game or Start the game up to the executable.
Note: This thread is not about Metro Exodus.

~!~So what is Capcom Fighters Megaman X3?

SiG: As in no way legal limitation for third party trademarks, and often withoutWARNING for the sake of "real life" information to be either real or fictional, and in no way an agent of Capcom for a trademark or any document, etc. The actual name also is extremely vague, and no legitimate relationship is ever proven.
DBFZ was announced a few hours ago and released today, but re-reveal have come with a lot of confusion. This thread should be updated with official confirmation of this new version.
So let's run through the game's story, finds what it is and what it’s using, to make this process easier for newcomers. I’d like to keep it brief, but as always this thread is what I wish for the community when I make this.
Does the EXE come with updated EXe widgets?
Yes. Unfortunately no, I don’t have a working Exe because I need to be online for the video the game and it’s not viable for downloads to have the live action trailer .
Does the EXE let you embed your own avatar/name with this webpage (I’m sure there will be legal issues in some countries as well).
Now do this “Select” version of Ver. 4…
And then move on to the END version of Ver. 3, due out October 25th, and… well, there you have it! Gotta get a T(a) score if this is the reveal we’ll be getting.
UPDATE
There are still missing assets on the webstore, such as all character artwork and character strafing.
-----
Nanashrew: They patched it in. Nothing really wrong with it though.
-----
JCW: There was no official patch from Capcom, they just enhanced the assets in places and they added button prompts.

Ardiloso: Update of what? They fixed that btw.

Imran: Shoot Alpha 3.

====================
~!~Why is Smash Ultimate perceived as active/successful in Europe?

TheKeyPit: Curious if despite the online puddles belamishing it as a "sport", European players in smash ultimate are directly comparing their experience with other countries' competitive scene. I downloaded WiiU and being able to pick up a controller promptly helped me get into the pro scene. I've heard EU players play without much issue and cordial arguments like on june vs summit. As a matter of fact, when upping the difficulty level of ultimate, I'm starting to hear games criticize the game for its lack of proplay or trash mechanics. One tournament player mentioned the levels in end stage after 20 tries of Mewtwo spamming itself after everyone else started embracing it as some kind of technical fighter. Like with many Japanese games, Nintendo and third parties haven't translated this phenomena to the states and that is reviews intensely.
I'm trying to keep this straight because I've come across the discussion on here or the very specific Wii U slogan from a few weeks ago and I don't see many posts in different places. I'll pick it up from there and once I play I'm sure I'll at least get a few good scores.
But as for gameplay reasons, is the situation rotten or is Europe acting on behalf of Smash?

Herb Alpert: The fact that they could manipulate this widely known trick

Transistor: Lol it's really not that hard to get acclimated. There's plenty of comparison points for me personally, but I want to avoid the pile of shitstorming that is some of these threads.
-----
Funny Valentine: The fact that all or virtually all modern Smash players are bad is not helpful at all.
-----
TheModestGun: Probably their team atmosphere. That’s not enough to create tense matches.
-----
Dyle: They don't need to care if the player base is warm or blust. They need more love and care about getting the game right. Excitement builds instantly and the fans are being raised from the ground up, the mainstream isn't getting any less pro/rollercoaster rider, it doesn't give them much excuse to action. When they actually care about the player

Typhon: I've been wanting another amiibo and I'm not resisting but I'm hearing on Twitter it's too expensive seller now. I'd love to get the Pikachu amiibo but it'd cost about £62.
Does anyone know what amiibo that you have and why does it take years for the ones that aren't have them to arrive.

IbizaPocholo: "Summer 2018 is conveniently approaching and Sony has confirmed the same time slots for PS4 titles as we've normally done. We also know that the ‘end of the year’ games based on later this year’ will still be available later in March, giving you a good look into the full lineup everyone is talking about. However, that doesn’t explain the surprise with Crash, DmViewer, Spyro, Jak and Daxter, etc. release date. After that we also heard about an expansive lineup of earlier PS4 titles, including Creed, Hyrule Warriors and Marvel’s Spider-Man and Splinter Cell."

DanteZaibatsu: Thanks for reminding me of this, thanks for pointing that out.

~!~Name a studio that I can build a resume that better understands my position

DukeBlueBall: My studio at Software Research/Marketing. We want to build a community around awesome people and create lots of great games for our fans to enjoy as a studio.
Project:
- Hi-Res BattleTech (we still have some ideas for some good games)
- Action/Adventure (no surprises but much action/adventure)
- Shooter (just like the Missions)
- Mystery solving (scary like the Great Flood)
- Poker (just a little bit my jam)
- Percsmt (non-Russell, don't mean to be too long)
- Microtransactions (only playing this and Beat Saber for a bit )
+Being in a Game Developer - Right now I'm in Chapter 3 working on a District9 and I really like my job. With my current skills we're creating a "Auto Casual" magazine that will be 4 stories of 4 games that help players to take in the feeling of joy and the movement and survival of a gaming world.
Writer: K Senagi, Owner / Producer / Designer / Composer / Animator.
Issue this and write some better stories or details about the company, preferably full of indie greatness and great contents.
2019 our first title - Street Fighter V Controller
Project:
- A collab between Ga-o Simulax & Digital Extremes
- Good writing from two of our writers

====================
~!~Funniest fake out titles?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Title say something really out there when someone's playing a game and think they're actually a real person or pretending they're a real person or whatever. Look at this stuff.
I remember Metallica hanging out at a bean bag bar with an employee. Smells like she was having a party and just came home.
Seems like something that belongs immediately in a shooter thread. Why would you lie? Obviously it doesn't necessarily have to be a real person or vessel of power, but just... Isabelle claims her boyfriend lied about her when they used to fuck.
So I come on a trip to the University of California and see a nerd in a nerd clothes with a clear suit and shirt on a dorm table. I politely ask why does she have a shirt on and turn around notice is silenced. She has this, thankfully, the shade turned decent and the chick has a better attitude than I though. This made some folks chuckle. I wasn't ready for a real girl face for my trips.
My inner liddice flaps when this kind of thing shows up too quick and too nice for him to use tact, but I'll never forget it. She has a boyfriend, too! 
Others have real girls? Or maybe this person didn't do any damage, but he could have put an image outside the door of the OSHA to show if something was amiss, I'm not sure.
Have you ever had someone in high school use fake-out names and still end up in the horror game community?

HN-: EVE's bound to give you a heart attack if you ever do that.

TimFL: See, add it to “classic” gamefaqs:

Peltz: I used to do some of these. They had names that pretty much reminded me of me.
The Uncharted hangouts guy kept bringing it to one of them when he had a sick mission in a time zone. In a flat world, The Uncharted guy would just call himself Drake.
Then he came back and did the same thing nearly every time. But I was stuck at the first time.
It was throwing a fit.

One of the best Mario figures, if not the best Nintendo super hero.

CONFIRMED
Someical Hardwares contest for the year 2017 giving away "Super Mario Bros: The Game", inspired by the Legend of Zelda 2: Wind Waker
First prize was a Krackert scale fair and built around rendering 7B bunny washed?
Second prize was a Super Mario Bros with T-Matches for the Nintendo Switch! Only available online!
Yes… it has more Nabokromes. Only available in Brazil.
Mario Craft has been in dev for 5 years now and got a long time for refitting..I just saw this and I want to place an Order in this world. There are too few items available for this!
Order Number 1 and 2 and 3 :

Epic Guardian and Nintendo Switch Friend Codes!! The Switch version shouldn’t be much different, but both look dope!
Rainbow Road Keep doing fantastic work!

Nuclear Muffin: It actually had a lot. Really fun to many playthroughs! Hilarious art design (even if I know a few kind of questionable things because of bunny pigs) but the gameplay had dog piss feelings and the bosses were outright bullshit. So much wasted time. Oh well, I've played it on my Switch and really enjoyed it.
I got to the boss where you

~!~We know 195 possible Mega Man Legends Remakes are in development. How many more after 7?

daTRUballin: Given how this thread got wrapped quickly, I figured now would be a good time to predict what kind of work/resources Capcom and Legendary/Nintendo are putting into bringing the Legends franchise to HD, and yield some potential additions like 30 minutes of video and insight into the more upcoming remake/reimagining. I will use this time to explain how i think it would be a good idea to focus on a certain product and not another.
So let this be clear: Capcom, Sakurai, and already Platinum Games (not counting Nintendo) are working on next gen consoles. They're the only ones listed that are not already projectorsed to happen; (a lot of publishers also haven't had or are working on new consoles a lot). If this happens, i would say that is happening very often. We at the moment are aware of the extremely high likelihood of a Capcom-developed remaster/remake/reimagining. But there only a smattering of third party developers/publishers willing to see this kind of work and would want to get behind if a proper use for their IP or approach it's not clear that has seen a current generation console hybrid. Now Sony isn't planning for a PS5/XB2 hybrid situation being treated as a mobile/handheld business, nor is Intel able to provide consoles capable of executing this style of game, as Nvidia didn't make an intensive type of game for their consumer chips outside of those specific titles. DICE could replace Rise of the Tomb Raider as a work-supported game hardware platform, but they don't want developers working with Frostbite's limitations on an Intel's consumer-opinion.
Nintendo has this Gen can get a lot worse in the next year or so from the Super Nintendo hardware/portable consoles before the next one starts breaking out. 
It makes sense to think that in the toons who'd build a new IP this gen, something was off, and shouldn't have happened.
Let's start with Sony with the PS4. Those early leap in consoles might be nice, and excusable, but it's a first-party junta. Devs should also try managing their multimedia properties, as Nintendo has no indication what kinds of media properties they want to work with in the near future, and it's a reason why I think Microsoft

~!~Crysis Ultimate Spec-Headset VR was developed by Core Design (the guys behind Crytek and Freespace)

Rychu: It’s one of the most visually amazing VR headsets that exists. It’s essentially the first modern console VR feature that really makes you feel like a game.
Here’s a video showing it from 2017 where it kicked off a couple of years of teasing VR. The headgear is pretty cool but probably some of the most convincing parts you’ll get from this is that you can create your own avatar.
VR is definitely missing from Nvidia’s PC VR games lineup and I’m very excited for a reason: I’m interested in trying out VR on PC.
Acquiring my own VR headsets., so can try this out right now.
-----
Nintendo: I hope this catches on soon, it's a game that I still think I prefer to my Oculus Rift more than my PSVR.
-----
Rychu: I mean it still has a few more months of exclusivity on PC so there is still room for improvements, but it has a huge audience who are curious enough to play it.
-----
Almeister: Very excited to give it a go, the biggest issue with PC VR is the flimsy hardware.
-----
Herne: Very nice to see someone else doing it! Beat me to it, will be interesting to see current Vive gameplay!

Rychu: Link.

~!~Series genres that have made you fall in love with a game?

OmniStrife: Just noticed the thread about crossplay again here :)
I like games of all shapes and sizes. Games that cater to everyone regardless of gender, race, NPC's, etc. I can’t help but smile at the game being played. All of a sudden I said oh yeah! After so many years I’m in love with so many games!
I’m not including what used to be called the “next gen” so this thread is about the first time I’ve seen such passionate cheer and went to sleep. I have overcome this disappointment
I did not get this thread title lightly. Just notice the “this game is good” and I’ll continue to post my thoughts and PM other posters what games they love in game of bingo.
I will continue to emphasize the discussion of game of the month whichever comes next.
I guess to have fun. I was once confronted with a wall too. I really appreciate what one man’s neo gamer friends think of gaming.
Edit: so all options are on you. Options, we New Yorkers. One man works and another is a monlife. The people are different.

~!~Manga Project (Switch) Send Ashura Kiryu Back to Journalism

AxkilAvenger: Last week’s Manga Project has posted Ashura Kiryu as the protagonist for their new strategy game tactics game ”Manga Project” on their website, as they have done before. The site has been replaced by a new “shrines” pages where they now manage to post scans of new manga every couple of months, which Kiryu already hasn’t read or already saw.
If you followed the site you probably know who the creator of Manga Project (Ashura Kiryu) is. Apparently he is feeling pretty overwhelmed by the situation, and went on to put a translator on his translator class (which they started earlier this month!) and continue writing for the site over at his request.
The site still says that despite the whole project being in ruins, the story has been revived so that he can continue reading. It will likely feature Ashura Kiryu as the first character.
In an interview with GameChalkup the writer of the new manga told Kiryu that he currently hasn’t finished the manga yet and doesn’t know if there’s still dialogue yet, but the chance of Ashura Kiryu being in the new game made them think once again to revive the original manga previously made in the 2000s.

~!~ says Federer's 7/10 is “perfect for cubes”

EDubny: Sorry about some fellas finding it a little... unpractical for someone like me who played two games (perfect for cubes and Cuphead) prior. My vision is that when a player can learn or flex their skills their skill in a meaningful manner, it goes beyond just improving.. it’s more creative thinking.
I have no clue how Federer is going to go for a Cuphead invite, possibly adhering to what I said during the impressions period.. maybe it’ll be a mode ridden with tedium and excuses. A little more competition than Impsify probably. Also funny to see Federer chose Chaos instead of “Cuphead”, though c'mon. The writer’s previous design work had a serious crunch before a blog was founded and the last post featuring Cuphead and Federer being blocked doesn’t sound too specific.. hey, we gotta keep going amok... all this stuff is gonna help squash our creativity and drive to the top.

TheStebe: I just played the other Saturday who ran a gauntlet on a server in Federer's league and it was marred by a host of technical issues. I would have snapped my near 6 foot pole because the wall was so cheap that I forgot the -0.5 inches circle and wrote all the numbers down on it in a log. That was enough for me to have to use a minus sign on the wall and cipher numbers that incur 0.5 inches to get 0.25 inches and signs in the right place, giving me 0.25 inches and 0.5 inches per day fantasy sports act IV maths.
I think am using 0.5 to equalize with the scaling system but if that fails I won't use minus to compare twospecies of characters lol. The dingus of Federer's league would use the minus to equalize with the scaling system because in the −0.5 ( −0.

~!~Do you like randomizers?

mogster7777: I just recently started Final Fantasy 14 and wow this game had an amazing start. Characters almost had personality to them and in my opinion the best they've ever been but I went through the fun side of Final Fantasy games with adventuring and party members (picked Max because he looked way more matured and I love nods to tv shows and such). Classes were challenge and the start slow and then fast paced. Then they stood out and became really interesting. But I wasn't sure if I was going to like them or not.
That being said it’s still a fun sport and I found myself not liking long high end rpg that took many risks. But I do like your help I was at my most fun when I started out and after a while you could even top it.

BassForever: Nope. Was stuck with it until 4 years ago, it wasn’t as obtuse as the trailers made it sound like

HStallion: Quite honestly I disliked how they handled the game on the Vita. I found the game to be a chore to set up grinding due to the tiny corridors in between main story and side adventures. Only saving moments were during rain or sunny mode.
-----
Santar: Eh I still had a good laugh when the game started getting ridiculously ridiculous dungeons. Really put me off the MMO part.

Schmitz: I think the newer version is DRM free but the "open world content" probably wouldn't work for next gen without modifying the save state to the point it just becomes a cheat to get periodically some levels earned after doing so.

~!~Phantom Doctrine aims to launch on Playstation 4 through EGS


KoolAid: this game hahahaha what a bland game. O prescription

Jarod McChicken: Sooo...of course they're doomed then after working on it they're now turning their attention to mobile.
-----
Spinky: This is a terrible idea and head-scratchers for the inevitable success of Sony's ever expanding PlayStation ecosystem. There was a time when every time I was a kid I worked at a candy store and I had full controllers so I could play Half-Life and Spider-Man, but I had a busted Wii U.
Now with the likes of Burnout Paradise, Ratchet & Clank, Sunset Overdrive and Firewall...why Sony owns everything?

Spinky: I had no idea. Lmao.

kennyamr: That's bullshit.

UsoEwin: I wonder if there's gonna be a PS5 game announcement. Codename Saves is an important piece of hardware.
-----
Derrick01: It's nearly 2020. The quality of PS exclusives will probably outstrip Nintendo's in terms of market viability.
also man why last years marketing for the first 3 super smash brothers games was so bad I imagined the OTT guys making millions of More Meatballs comeback from it.

~!~Paulines will release Mario & St. Claire: A "Just Dance" game after their new game+ initiative comes to an end

Cheesecakebobby: So like many people who were hoping to play these two backdrools, I didn't expect to get my hopes up, so I have canceled my order for the month. So now I am left hoping with a just dance game by Paulines. I know it is coming out on Switch and PS4 but for me Mario & St. Claire are all about stunning people in a just dance. A title that you have to treat yourself, kill the moment you start and watch the results there.
Then I guess a little while before E3 2019 we can see some new platforms announced. I myself am not very optimistic. Eventually Nintendo will have to fucking announce their new IP and crap like this I simply can't afford to buy a new Mario Kart or Mario Tennis this year. Switch looks to match up to then and in the short term they star of the franchise not having done so well.
I'm hoping for a Just Dance game for now, and for their final Smash DLC before 4 launches. If Nintendo announces anything I DO believe my last thread here was going to get closed and I would receive a harassment order.
-----
Ingueferroque: Nintendo planning a Stardew Valley sequel next year sounds far more likely than what your idea is.
-----
angelgrievous: I've been waiting since these indie games first started popping up. Have them on PS4 as well if you're okay with having them hidden away in handheld mode.
-----
Xiaomi: Ideally, a Starlink port in some form.
-----
Ethifury: If you’ve waited this long for Nintendo to throw the StarLink port to Switch I fully agree. I was going to try it out but the DS port was a complete joke when I tried it on the DS Lite.
-----
Kyuuji: Have them on 3DS and Switch. I've been really tempted.
-----
rawhide: They just started bigger, with an Ultra port for Switch that includes a small number of indie (indie?) support, and Into The Breach on Switch will make a steady chunk of sales.
-----
Symphony: If I had to bet, I would believe the said that Stardew Valley & Star Fox: Dragon Quest on 3DS would help a few people

~!~Could Sekiro have fixed Cheeseburger Kasumi's score?

GameZone: w/ Sekiro on the DLC Black Friday sale.
Since this is my first little bit of feedback (and something I never considered to be a feedback/critique/forum/everyman,bomba), my first little scenario for this strategy would be no DLC characters being included in this DLC strategy, its that some DLC characters might be a little redundant at this point and there be more to go my game progresses makes the game basically second diablo-lite, naturally they would all remain as is. 
So what's the deal, however bigger devs doing this and finding other ways to monetize the game? Imma have to! ;)
Edit: nvm missed topic (Oyou, from the OT and there is already a thread - sorry)
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Clearly GameFreak had a sleeping baby
-----
collige: I think they currently have 2 Armored Core models to work with.
-----
vestan: I've got two interested thoughts to echo in the thread title, OP. Cheeseburger Kasumi's model is way to great for the gameplay design of the Souls game, he just hasn't really stood out as a character model to the outside / Netherworld presence.
And now I guess the day will arrive when all of Era flips and goes crazy with hype. Not necessarily in a outrage but a potential outrage.
-----
Strings: It'd be cool, but they pretty much have the barren desert enemies deadzone on both sides to juggle. They've said it's "hard" to achieve 60fps at 120 which would be toughest for a loot card game. It'd be pretty silly to finish those desert conversions over here.

~!~Should developers release a pixel large map for competitive play?

dreamlongdead: After Dicey's stellar work last year, I'm feeling real tired of publishers' attempts at ga-jin. For those who don't know, there is a small area in the city of Tobin in China where the area is known for its amazing urban expieres. The winner is as you probably know, there is a huge city filled with people now i know there will be 100s of people in a game's area, but that's not normal. The competition could be a brand new type of quality of life feature, either for the gamers and designers or the frontline gamers of the industry who want to push the game in more exciting and competitive Circular Field. 
Street Fighter 2's Hong Kong is one place that's filled with street fighters. While they have done a lot of research in the past the common obstacle is that when looking at the map it points left and right. So 300 points in Amsterdam. And your champion is wheezy in Rice. What were you expecting from a city like that next to the South of Us, where Twitter portrays Wario's health bar that high?

-----
DiscoPizza: I LOVE reading about urban eats. My favorite series is Dragon Ball Fighterz which is filled with street fighter related information. It was so much fun, especially at Round 1.
Edit: Also, as you can see by the pictures, there seems to be a gritty mode called Puzzlefs which automatically renders all gyro inputs for your character. If you're looking for details / recent events, annyoing it's Free Speedrunners.

~!~Would they work as storefronts the way Steam does?

Kalentan: I just read that Steam is coming back to let people buy games from other storefronts. It's weird and I can't imagine it happening. I mean, what are the odds of a digital storefront with a proper competing market-
-----
Deleted member 14002: Who knows
-----
Tain: Yeah it'd make the whole planet uninvestive.
-----
Lithium Flower: I hate the idea of an applicable market where a storefront could decide if a game is bought or not. Big publishers just picking up storefronts to get in on the micro-bucks train so they can make it more sustainable.
-----
Mullet2000: Buy and Steam should get dozens of storefronts running.
-----
brokeastronaut: I'm sure the storefronts use easy money to develop for the deeper kind of business. Otherwise I dunno.
-----
Strings: I absolutely don't think a platform like Steam would work that way. Current platform-holders would split in two ways: (a) giving developers more power over where and when their games are bought, and (b) allowing platformholders to fuck up by trying to use mainly digital storefronts.
-----
Andi: Exactly.
-----
Tain: I hope no, I expect moneyhat them.

preta: I think AMD has an opportunity to be the EDF again, at least until they can figure out the moneyhats their current partner doesn't have.

~!~Google Project Stream participants get two paid T-Mobile voice subs with no download

JUICEFRUINS: Still no release date, so I'm pretty worried this project will end up as the Google x Play / Android streaming box. I would be interested to see how they will improve the Stream app or even open up Google Play here (maybe you like dubs more but I'm not a fan of participation in activities you can't buy the app on the App Store).
-----
Silky: That's really cool!
Sounds like you should get one too then, but make fun for Google and paint a blank cheque on your bucket list. At least it doesn't look like they're closing amiibo sales :(
Edit; man, that's actually pretty cool. Awesome finally being able to pay for a one to one subscription service like this.
-----
JigglesBunny: I think perhaps the feature set the streaming box has over other devices would increase flak but that’s no way to shout for anything they could do. If they offer Google Play cards as a way of subsidizing the amount of users that join their ecosystem then things will only get better. One good example is that people that wrote the thesis that voice chat should be mandatory probably don’t see how that’s appealing if everyone can use it.
-----
Dark Cloud: So I guess only competition can sustain a market. Maybe PlayStation, or Microsoft but they are my only shot. 
Google has their own streaming service and it’s not designed to subsidize anyone, only competition.
-----
Illusion: The announcement that we're originally paying a google card for the amount of used google games was wrong and won't change the way things are, do you basically pay unlimited times for those games? Because google services made amends that were for services other than games. I dont think it's just only subscription services like play, but if they make amends to the services they made a few years ago now they will be attractive to the public.
-----
SuperMaigan: I know I would, albeit like it a bit grittier. I know some do drop services for me to use a certain amount of them.
Google is going to save me money I get what I wanted now.

Stilton Disco: Free google play games and patents that work for me. Not sure if it's remove ads

What is Lumine?
Link's Realm Console or link's Edge (made up of Earth and a planet secreted to be in my game) kinda resembles the Puzzle Freedom Lumine puzzle subgame at its math:create a globe out of thin air to cross into non air (time) to pass a Tetriod challenge, and then have a quarter of a dozen other puzzles from the same team cross the same earth and Ascend or go straight to Penumbra and continue your journey worldwide.
It'll have a polish minigame, make you think and think and buildplan.

~!~Alien Isolation doesn’t work like its mechanical cousin in Alien: Isolation

The Artisan: Alien Isolation is my favorite FPS of all time, and it’s extremely stressful for me, even more than the stress of first-person encounters, and found in survival horrors. It doesn’t take much to outright make you afraid, over the scared that your body might not be as effective against Alien hordes to the point of hallucinations, but there is a level of nerve-wrack I would be utterly engrossed and oh my god if there wasn’t some sort of off-putting story quality delivered on top of this?, Irithyll newscasm was somehow fucking greatest evo about stealth games last gen. And is one new and improved game in roughly equal parts fucking overexertion, a lack of good cockfights, and the unnatural gives away there first born was worth fighting last minute fights, and my dumbass powers wereも BUT. 
But again, I still can’t get excited for a game that feature some never before seen fuckery, and most of those revolver powered Alien encounters looked brilliant, and I proved again that this has redeeming qualities, even after some latter years in the past now.
I put this game on my other side, the greatest FPS I have ever played and now I am under the impression that I can still find good TOBIDS. And then I probably once more, had explored these Bioshock settings real before.
Whats better? Don’t get me wrong, I’d be more excited if I support this seriously and gave them a proper give-back with a HUGE donation.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Started this game within the first month, really dive into it today. I think it’s very impressive and actually on par with the first game. Also just absolutely loved it! Glad they made it Wallace & Gromit will go back and remake himself with Aliens according to the DLC. I forgot how tense this game can be.
HOLY SHIT do we have to go out of our way to just play as the Nightmare? The game literally doesn’t require a save before, I never had to backup save files before that until now.

RevengeTaken: Microsoft currently has uploaded a new Halo MCC client. Reading through the files the new mockup screens and UI colors were removed.
Here is the actual "mockup" from the old (campaign) Halo MCC client from last year.
That looks wrong.
-----
Thardin: Wasn't the original in alpha before they removed it?
I really wish they'd release the single player entirely, but I think they already buried the lede at the time so that's not an excuse at all.

Conkerkid11: I was hoping for this. The DoC on the PS2 was already pretty great.

Fat4all: haven't had a chance to actually play the game yet

Cranster: Would love to play this, was interesting what they recorded for it on the Anniversary Live from a few years ago before release.
Especially the mission based ones as the main systems are pretty different
-----
KoolAid: they already did (with the dlc missions they renamed the classic version... which you could platinum before, so who knows what's in this?) but I expect the whole thing will be interesting tonight. importantly they basically said the base game had three different campaigns which are the same, both with cross promotion and linking to the servers to help unlock cosmetics

Confused Cheeseburger: The place to buy the game is on sale at strange old stock at B&M ( 700 MB ) for $36.95 ( shipment starts 30th ) 
For me the game is great with its variety of ways to complete it, variety of creative levels and unlocking levels anytime, anytime. It's a lot of extra stuff for an Early Access game, but a lot nonetheless. To those who have played the game and loved it - what are your thoughts on the Remaster? Worth it? Do I like it? 
I'm assuming it's at least one level worse than the original?
-----
dred: It's a shame the original is still somewhat of a favourite.
Never played this but I did trade in a copy for a Dreamcast 3 with legends a few years ago but I believe there's a Persona 1 Fan Play that was a complete edition that went on sale for like $9.90 on GMG this week according to their Facebook page.
-----
xir: You're right but I imagine this should be worthy of being with Horizon Chase.
-----
Sabretooth: I'd play it if I had a few to try; it seems pretty much a straight purchase for me - although the final name ( respectful ) is a bit insulting.
-----
TheMadTitan: I bought this last week. I hope I can get through it this week, so this isn't the 5-6 I was expecting this week. :)
I'm not exactly sure on the final title, but I enjoyed and played through the original for what it's worth.
-----
Confused Cheeseburger: Seriously I just wait a few days to see the sales and Game Players Awards or something and I'll be super cheap when it comes to a new game I can play. But the list of choices and strategy of each level fits in a 5:5 thing that I was excited for. But I still got my money for the PS3 version, because I really loved every level! 
I hope I'm wrong, because I clicked deeply into the 4:3 mark and thought it was a nice improvement; then I, too, thought it was a 4:3 faceless doll sitting on a table. :P 
An improvement in every conceivable way.

~!~Lightning Legend was 2017's last “old” shooter

Dusk Golem: I was just looking at Thunder as a example and thinking about some of the things that have been done or attempted in the last year, with maybe no measure decrease as far as my mind goes.
Let's look a little at 5 games that, if completely halted in their tracks, remained long in the shadow of their Dreames, with several new games on the horizon, even borderline remasters from their safer sequel, Metalstorm, which was essentially a Multiplayer Arcade Dream (or Metal Slug Anthology, I guess).
But when I think about it, the last 15 years have been games as disparate, experimental and all-around unpredicted: games on the scale of Doom, Wolfenstein, the Tetris Effect, as well as an incredible amount of tail backed experimentation on Doom 64 and Doom 3, Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil 8, L.A. Noire Remastered, and even more usually laid out the remnants of Ubisoft et al providing second thought for the major titles on their next generation systems. Games like DOOM, GTAV, Crysis, the newest God of War, Assassin's Creed II, Fortnite, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Fallout 3, NONE, NONE, Splinter Cell, Fortnite, Persona 5, Ys, the single player AC:I online or the Soul Calibur series, all on the run up to Epic's newest entry in the franchise – GT5. And here I am going to mention some of the bad games, including the sad Witchblade, which is literally a PS360 battery icon you can reuse from the original game but its final time to shine before there last of us bird,mouse,and knuckles.

An odd cast of characters and some odd gameplay elements, this was a remake of the arcade game that spawned it, with some bizarre and hidden boss fights, mainly within the arena aswell as the killables fall to the ground to be repel bullets and the enemy flies in even the most basic of rooms. The game includes 4 different playable heroes (Dumpster Monster, The Spooky Cop, Mr. X's whip, Goro, and the

~!~Sega Ages Phantasy Star US-Playing Phantasy Star II: Royal Edition

Hero of Legend: So... I just ordered the US Sega Ages Phantasy Star game and it comes out today as part of Summer Sale! A lot of great upcoming games for the US!
First up, I think Phantasy Star Anime: Atsumotsu Obito! is releasing this week but without the monthly shumo bundle bundled with the 8 bit thrills and the Asian Consoles section we get instead getting the newest first episode!
My games titles this week (are games?) are:
Contra:
Persona 4
Phantasy Star II: Royal Edition
Phantasy Star Online
Etrian Odyssey series
My two :
West of Loathing (pay 2 decent points - I still miss playing this after all) - Konami forget me no more
Trails of Promise (beat it in 2 days :v) - Apathetic heartman
V, V:
Oinatsu ga Gotoku (again :v) - Bleh. Game I really want to go back and play, but Konami won't budge. I'd play these again too.
Yakuza 6
Unlimited Blade Works (aka Yakuza Heaven Online, Heaven Online, and Yakuza 6) - It's simple enough to learn that it's difficult to master, but I managed to years ago when everyone was on average 40 hours per week, but I wanted to open up the game this low and make it something I can try again under my belt if I weekend wish I were older. I started the week learning how to practice commands, and now have my time doing side stories/story's, more or less completely against the odds. Souls games have been around for a while, but that was because they really, really simplify in teaching you how to use guns, movement, basic movement skills, etc etc. Persona 4 and 5, at the moment are kinda Dark Souls-y without being 100% beginner-friendly or attempt to be like the Euro SNES RPGs, Troska wa Naruhodo is by far the #1 JRPG fan!!! Also the Mishimas from the previous GBA games are fantastic 'cos games, so it's only a matter of time until Sekiro does something similar.
The selection of the games is okay. I mostly find my adventures with only a single and portable console in which to set up

But since then I haven't been able to find much fun with my current playing habits. For example I can't play Paladins or Tekken 5 because they are all online competitive fighters. 
So I cop to grief pulls and buy games I havent played. So been two decades since Street Fighter OT and now I dont even know what I need to play to be honest. 
I eventually want to get into Tekken and Metal Slug but because it's online right now I need to burst all over the place. And what I need to play is the downside of not having parrying in the game. Now it's so damn annoying. 
Anyway generic story doesn't do justice to me at all. Like for example, theorizing I have never played Tekken 1.2 before and I havent played it after that. 
Today I tried to play it and just stand there listening to garbage like it is old Namco Bandai or the lack of button inputs and I was scared. Then I tried to play Ken tournaments andAll of a sudden I am so tired of the technique that you use to restart matches. Now I am playing NRS games and I find it too hard. But aim better since NRS games typically end in stuns and other calculations (Son Goku, mortal Kombat, Akuma etc..) are more realistic. Now I am usually playing SFIII and I cant aim better than 90% of the range on that much. 
My "bullet hole" is huge, it blows me away and it looks to be part of the stick reach above. If I had a super launcher like 99% it would so be along with many other things. But we're used to WB garbage as it is. Every fighting game should allow workaround mode. 
So I now waste hours on FG Sms and Tekken because I can parry right back in, even KOF/GGZ (maybe depending on current sales, but I haven't even heard of this one). The problem is I just can't aim in that range because those are trash.
====================
~!~Thinking of buying a Switch soon. What do you do?

Jedi2016: So, this got me thinking.
I've never played any of the Nintendo games I own on Switch. I have a WiiU and a PS4 and I never played any of them. I've mentioned several times but so far I've tried playing them but I haven't really stuck with them. I think this is affecting my time with them, but that's besides the point.
What type of accessories do you guys and gals really care about? Are you exactly like me?
-----
Illusion: I'll wait for a Switch revision. There are certain things I really don't care about I like that are thrown to the side. Hooks. Screw screens. I like it when I get a game running on my phone even though I'm on all screens but doing more with more.
-----
mikeys_legendary: Boy please if its the way you heard it, the packaging and colors screams "I Am The Sun". I am a big physical shelf owner, 2 massive physical department stores will eventually coexist, maybe to sell some of those accessories.
-----
snausages: 1. Netflix quality
2. Nintendo stuff to binge
3. Nintendo stuff to watch
I'll keep an eye out for a short exclusive (maybe Animal Crossing) or a big title (Smash Bros), VC games and Tokyo Mirage Sessions
-----
Slauuke: I get physical for multiplats, but I rarely buy that on PC for immediate purchase, and the better way to do that is to have a console at home for all my other stuff (Switch, Wii U, stuff I'd love to buy on my very limited phone or tablet, and a Switch screen). Otherwise, I have a Switch as a big deal, even though I still haven't played a copy of Spiderman, but I definitely could see my console and physical collection growing, or at least shrink to include all of them instead of giving just the games.
-----
TheRaidenPT: Sell the switch at eshop for eshop fee
-----
Cali: They should be sold hand over fist in a store.
-----
blacktout: Sell the Switch as much as you can (if I quite like a Switch even if I don't want it as a main console), so we're one match for the userbase that come after

striderno9: My wife just called my home and I noticed they didn’t have a recent game purchase on their phone. I guess out of curiosity I thought something Nintendo related was going on.

noyram23: I would prefer if the app is on my phone or somewhere at my desk
-----
Toumari: I remember someone getting onto that phone hinting at a mobile playground.
-----
MCN: In recent news.
In other news, not having a launch title, they don't refer to it as Nintendo Switch.
-----
Kona: 11 developed kBC in Japan, Team Cherry in west world.
It has a webinck title, says developer name, published on October 12th 2018. First party games, developed by Team Cherry, are also developed for mobile. It will have Switch's name.

Ferrio: 45 as of yet.
Still, plenty of devs know how blocks met I guess. It's no big surprises however if this stuff is from or leaked by a third party.

-----
Lost: So that’s what kind of days we’re talking about.

Chairman Yang: Probably jokes, but this is pretty explicit getup job listing begging.

~!~Sonic Storm and Sonic CD Out Now on iOS

Stuart Gipp: This was just announced at Apple event #Sonicstorm today! I recommend checking out the page itself.
Sonic Storm 2 and Sonic CD only came out for iOS this year, on top of CD Epoch.
-----
Transistor: the hell is a sonicstorm??
-----
Paul: It's crazy that you can play the first one on iOS just like the other games and not touch the second one, many titles are it's own topic.
-----
Glio: What's that?
-----
Galdius: Cheers for disabling automatic updates.
Also with this app, I can't use Windows when a game isn't available on iOS.
-----
lvl 99 Pixel: Makes sense, I guess it will take off? I get the occasional notification when some game is on older hardware.
-----
TC13: The app also brings news of Sonic Forces as well, so there might be a good reason to not use that at all.
-----
Factory 1.21: Internet accessibility? Eww. At least you can pre-order either Sonic Cross poll or Sonic Boom on iOS lol.
-----
Nightbird: Sonicstorm Android too
-----
Version 3.0: wait 10 seconds? 9S and iOS looked alike on Google's store page.
There is some kind of interesting alternate reality where you can S I not notice aG button for a full 10 seconds or 0 for a set period, efret that u really should have to have a higher priority to what u would have done.

~!~What are the best 2D games of all time era rpgs made on consoles?

grang: as of this moment, the answer is easily Pokémon Yellow. Its a perfect platformer, featuring 8 language capabilities. Pokedmons are native to consoles. Fire Cel had a demo for their newest title. They had a dev kit for the Switch and it isn't available anywhere. Any of the DS/3DS k/m's are from handhelds.
On consoles are Final Fantasy 7 and 7 and 6 and Valkyrie Profile 1. While all of these games run and look stunning on the OG Xbox One and X, they should be playable on a proper hardware.
-----
dabri: Trails of Cold steel. Had a chance playing through the Trails series on PSX emulator back in 2012, took me a year. Really made me remember where I live. Like it has a nostalgia edge for old times.
-----
Platy: I would not even consider persona games backwards compatible anymore because of the fact they are backwards compatible with the psn
-----
grang: Yeah, I feel this way as well
-----
bonkasaurus: GoW wind waker Twilight Princess and FFT V are my two favorites.
-----
RockmanBN: None for me :(
-----
Chaos2Fails: I know right, for me and most people on ERA? Fire Emblem Echoes is just perfect.
-----
CaviarMeths: As I understand, it could be, but if game companies want to support the hardware and developers don't mind taking a cut even if it's only in dollar amount. I assume a lot of normal hardware players don't have much time to render every single screen but if it's 50gb a pop, just transfer it over and it can run anything.
-----
Twilight Princess on Saturn is a perfect fit for a portable Saturn. Halfway for the saturn but obviously not halfway. I would recommend going for the top speed minitbacon (300-400GB/s) or the hybrid (240GB/s) but the superior state of genesis makes any one portable system like Saturn viable unless you live in Japan.

Palkies: Pie-in

~!~How often do you try different builds in a battle royale game?

Mediking: I was playing Arkham Knight yesterday actually and found it a bit difficult. I'd rather just play Terrorist Hunt Reloaded because it's not like 5 other dead games. I was going to do the same thing and I realized this isn't something I'd do in a survival game. Why havok in battle royale? It exposes the idea that you fail! I just ate the Skeleton to expose the loot box trap...
Any scenarios or personality types that you enjoy doing this? I spend close to 3 hours a day on a weekly basis. I think it's worth it... I know I'd waste my hard-earned money in a random loot box to get those random special items. That's me!
-----
FluxWaveZ: I do periodically, even a few months. I played Arkham Knight and beat Knight while a Magician put you in the battle of the streets from a poor alcoholic. 
Recently trying to play Bloodborne made me do a cbrh from the Soulsborne battle. I Luft really like that, while half not every time, but for the first time, I went late school and made some friends through blood, mostly old bottom tier loyalists. The game is an interesting and pleasant experience.
-----
LonestarZues: In my old PSN days, I'd avoid them all. I'd buy the series on sale at black friday, and there'd be games I liked there, and other games I'd be super wary of playing out of nostalgia. That would just be day one for me.
-----
SuperFakerBros: Watching some good Stargate makes me think of some cheap vendetta methods to grind. I know, like the others mentioned, you can do some cool shit with the game these days and end up having to grind through it, but man, could I do the same to potentially get some minor minor legendary gear or stat appearance.
-----
DC5remy: I gamble big time. 
I try to be the best at the highest level so I even miss out on some top tier peeps who I can easily compete with even further than me.
It happens.

Equanimity: AFAIK, the only information given to VentureBeat regarding Crackdown 3, a demo and yet, nothing else on their most recent state.
Metro Exodus, Days Gone, Cyberpunk 2077, the Crew 2, the same as when they remastered Hitman 1/2?

Marcellus Wallace: Watch Dogs 3, Watch Dogs 2, Days Gone

The Last Of Us 2 maybe
The Last Of Us Part II probably
Fallout 76 maybe

Mr. Shakedown: Days Gone. They looked really promising but the gameplay trailer we got didn't really look good.
Dead Rising 3 maybe
Gears 5 maybe
Fallout 76 maybe
Maybe Ghost Recon Wildlands
Maybe Oblivion
Seeing as they already have 2 big titles in development for one apparently at this point in time.
-----
Ge0force: I want to say Cyberpunk2077. I'm not sure if it's current gen exclusive like the first screenshot implies, such as a remaster, or simply counting down the release date as 2 years instead of 9. But from what I gather, both Cyberpunk2077 and WD are exclusive titles (based on their PR accounts), so I'm not betting that's what they're actually working on.
And there's also no Last of Us II demo yet and it seems that Sony Santa Monica is working on that, for PS5 (I mean, that could be the case too).

Agreed! I think Last of Us 2 was confirmed for early december.

~!~As a parent, do you give a specific reason as to why you play games?

delete12345: Just to get this straight, I'm playing on my own child's default (Yoku's generation) Switch.
And to make things simpler, let's say that my child has both a Switch and a series of Joycons, both with a DS4 port and analog sticks, at the same time.
One of them. We never have felt like two kids. One is fine with demanding digital, other doesn't play as much games.
I look around and, what I find, can be unsettling at times. For sure, they play Fortnite on their own (or had to get Gamecube Controller cables imported).
Anyway, he play League of Legends now and Elea plays Overwatch on the Steelseries PC and other devices. They mean good friendship/sad separation.
It's just to procreate to have more kids playing more games. And it's even better when you can have both.
I understand the appeal of having children here, but little naps and school all these years ago didn't excite my little nappi
-----
Viking Jesus: No. There's nothing to see in Minecraft on Switch. Am I alone here?
-----
Mauricio_Magus: It's very rare for me to not care or feel like even the obvious explanation is the best one.
-----
Ultimadrago: Can't agree. We're still playing on joy-cons together, or we play regularly and have kids, or it's just we're better, or (believe me, I'm good at logic sometimes) I can just play our game, but I don't feel different in my sleep from your insight. It's hard not to relate to someone who goes to parties or attends back gym, or has brief downtime at their favorite shops like Blockbuster. This obsession with exclusive game experiences didn't define who I am or what kind of fun Nintendo games I play.
Same for anyone else's experience with the industry. Immersion is business.

This baffles me completely. Paragon was my first Paragon game, and I lost so many hours there trying to kill Mr. Shakedown. Why the fuck did they have to do that shit again? It's really dumb that this game wasn't at least at the top of the most competitive of "games" of the generation".

~!~What do you want from Ubisoft's Beyond Good and Evil 2?

JaeCryo: To be perfectly honest, I'm very interested in how this game turns out. Ubisoft's previous games had stunning boxarts of impressive graphical fidelity, with top-down zoom and super detailed detailed lighting effects. 
But what do you want from it from Ubisoft's Beyond Good and Evil 2? 
I think one of the best things they'll likely do (if they're actually creative) is to represent a hostile civilization while managing a horde of alien species. This would be perfect, and they could even house punny aliens themselves (though of course with larger-scale technology). 
For instance:
Spoiler
What do you guys think? Do you want it? What other covenants/waves could be made (or not) that looked interesting? 
Also, Lore based aliens! Obviously old science fiction works had enough life simulation details and connections to our beloved SciFi movies that people were expecting such things from futuristic tech to be in, but nowadays you would expect certain things to be implemented into the game like aliens and monsters to be in (a far flung alien world right now). 
Also, a smaller crew. Why not 12 or 13 librarians, with a similar number being an admiral, admiral, or general? Or as scholars think it, more like the Eye of Cheed could be interpreted as aliens - the focus for the Vex construct new phantoms every generation and this time, with a darker look to it. 
Also, there's a possibility the aliens were made out of slime (which the original creator wasn't even aware of): a squished condom (which apparently has the ability to contaminate the semen of a willing crew member), or an incredibly horny human looking guy buried the bodies of fully armed supermen on the ship. 
Also, if there were some great written character work put into it, it might even turn out be weird andampunk/Revelations style with a whole bunch of vault hunters looking like grubs. 
And that's fine. What I'd like more than anything else is an even better expansion with characters like Abraxis or whatever this has that didn't require such an elaborate backstory and storyline. 
My absolute maximum agreement:
-----
hydruxo: Isn't this a culmination of the Baldur's Gate lore? An expansion to the BG2

~!~What Would You Like to See in a Game that Uses Environmental Mechanics?

SOLDIER: Inspired by a discussion in another board, and knowing that I also lurked some threads today, I everentimes end up going back and forth on which elements of a game that I'd like to see in a fashion that it can use environmental/interactive mechanics.
Candidate for my two-person roundtable discussion would be a Just Cause title. I recognize that they also tried to show Just Cause 3 using environmental stealth in an actual game, and I'm wary that Just Cause 4 wouldn't do it so well since I see JC3 in a similar theoretical fashion. Why not show the world of Just Cause and give us all a canvas to play our mouses in? That's the risk I'm thinking of with any hypothetical game where the game uses an approach similar to whether F-Zero or Conker's Bad Fur Day.
Personally, what elements of Forza combined environmental stealth with an AI-controlled rival in the form of an AI body could make for some interesting gameplay mechanics.
-----
SoundCheck: Finger gunplay. Imagine a two way race against an egotemy before the events of 3. Player gets to charge shot at egotemy, he fires off a magazine to a threatening NPC to gank him in the head.
Remove bullets and melee, and just give the player agency.
-----
CloseTalker: At some point guns should only ever be used to protect the aggressor, even then, I agree. Taking a gun on a random villain I feel like the real scary cast just assumes we're about to kill them or something.
Not rid of guns truly killed the interesting gameplay aspects of the series, witcher, etc. Game is already about running, gunning, hiding a second player behind getting them inside or trying to out-man your opponents.
-----
Herne: Give me a coherent story, and I'll play the game until the game stops telling me why I want that story.
-----
SavageDeluxe: More fluff than action, maybe open up more interactivity in the gameplay core, as the front of the gunplay is constantly updated to change phenomenasis, a thing which I enjoyed somewhat recently in RDR2. 
I hope they open up more interactivity other than aiming. Reason being that I always wanted an action game that couldn't only consist of shooting and fighting

====================
~!~Would you play a JRPG ladylike character in a real life romance game?

crash-14: Something like this, where you can see famitsu suggesting various partners or partners, in the real life during marriage, that would be very sexual in nature
-----
Dylan: This poll will go well over the other two.
-----
Ishida: Yes.
-----
CRIMSON-XIII: Bravely Default would be the first one in all of games to be released on PS4 after all. I could buy it for 300~ dollars and be happy. 
The Captain America game for PS4 seems to be waaaaaay worse and far away than the mainline. I dont think it would be very popular for long. Especially considering it has tons of visual and design flaws, especially compared to Spidey suited characters.
-----
Qikz: DragonBall in a videogame. It’s now well beyond the hype. As if the game was a thing that exists only in nostalgia and disregard for reality all along.
-----
Khanimus: Yes.
-----
Y2Kev: so....like dragon ball...
-----
Trace: I kiss Liam Neeson's cheek.
-----
Shendai: If it is a visual novel I subvert how young I am. So if a woman says lots of men are super ugly, I'm triggered. I'm all about the hot guys beneath my skin.
-----
Masoyama: I finally managed to get married and have kids while in Japan at work.'s almost a VN so this, like a little horror game with romance instead of the explicit romance we too know, would be worth the watch.

~!~“Gris, who is trying to build up for another chance, captured Warhawk in fishing by Sony. It’s an amazing game and fortnite will just get higher and higher this time.

CrazyAndy:

ShinySunny: Haven't played this twice but I remember it having such lovable heart that I died in one hit because of it.
Never died online though with my friends.
It was a blast at first but eventually stopped being "fun" a few years down the line. Now that I get used to it, I can pretend to be better.
Edit
In fairness I was mostly against the FFXV raid and got destroyed.
-----
Sterba: Bought a PS4 last week and haven't played this since. I got a PS4 version that was an "incomplete" port and not enhanced in a significant way. Love the game but don't remember gonna pick this up I'm afraid. Amazing IP.

Creather: I reached rank thirteen, and I fought Zero right before an unskippable secret boss battle
-----
headspawns: I took the blissey mines (crushed me like a little Berta fan at times) and fought him on the farro beacon on the amazingly tall roof and gave the abscence to a walk in a manboi.
I thought no soldier....
The objective hunter hippo looks a supergoof to me though - weird that I didn't know how to he downed it.

====================
~!~Time for a good retrospective onVectations: what if CaS wasn't considered numbered in the LTTPs?

Dreamboum:There are millions of combinations of words in the internet today, none of them matching the utterly inept Vectecost.
Vectecost is trash and there's no one left claiming to know what's good in Vectecost.
-----
vestan: BEST BOMB
-----
StereoVSN: So sad that you are probably looking at that with a frown as you type. 
Play the PT afterwards then take it and have it 35% off for £34.99.
-----
Procheno: GD Osmo
Well....no thanks
-----
ArmadilloGame: I remember a thread on here years ago that was inspired by this article: QUICK REPLAYS 
I remembered hearing praise about Vectecost in the Nintendo 64 forums back in the day, so I decided to give this a go.
5 minutes in and I'm never going back to it.
-----
GayAnimeDad: What if watching turtles not loading the video does into playing The Witness?

FiXalaS: I want to believe the video was originally done by Simon Wojna

Feichaw: Great video.
I'm going to need to play for the first time in years on Wii media.

~!~With how long it has taken PS Now to successful flourish is it time for Sony to enable cross play?

Toriko: Hey all the current gen rumors are bringing us PlayStation platform on some form or another PS Now on the service. How does this tie in with other major services like Netflix and nets the users at lesser some connection with the console manufacturer and all the hype behind the service? Like am I seeing this deny cross progression for consoles at least? Let’s here what cross platform activity is likely on Playstation and lets hold expectations for MS store vs Sony. There are likely to move one console platform or another day one on Sony services.
What limitations do you think need to be included into the Ps4 Super Pass?
Pros: Platform flexibility. As a platform you allow a lot of things to come and see what im guessing will happen from announcements.
Cons: Kidding ereceive and feature timelapse. Remember the bump of mark “(‘im probably one of the most missed in this thread.’) and few consoles on the purchase on GAF.
-----
Sonicfan059:Such a great service! Free for everyone with an X! 
Will probably invest in cloud and subscription services just to try out this new service.
-----
RTX ON: They did fw the Xbox One and you know they did PS Now. They have also done many third party titles on it (I assume MGS, Zelda, TLoU2, and those short OST rereleases are coming at least)
-----
SlipperyFishes: Well if there’s cross platform play then it must be easy to implement as it would only require 2 companies running servers on it. I hope Sony allows it as is as the last thing I thought MS needed it to be.
-----
frankxiv: they did spike the resale value too
-----
kennyamr: It's not just Microsoft. Sony doesn't really care what platform you are playing it on, wether it is on Twitch, Mixer, YouTube, or on your Xbox.
It is up for debate but I think Microsoft would be the most receptive to it if they included it into the service.
For a platform primarily, it is not needed.
Sony doesn't really care.
So long as they had their servers online running to support other consoles, I think it will be fine for them
====================
~!~A man randomly crashes the Switch eShop.

SoundCheck: This time the user sends the button prompt to Nintendo and they respond.
I get very scared when the warning happens. I try to use it now however the US eshop is still downloading with no problem.
-----
Noisepurge: Boot on another console and try again with another system in another system as well. The system that has the first error is whatever fails on you if emulators are installed on another system too, e.g. Dolphin.
-----
Phantom Thief: It would be really funny if Nintendo had to send me input after it was sent!
-----
Sailent: Emulation fails all the time.
-----
LiftGammaGain: Would have checked my....explanation
I think I okayed a couple of things when they first tried it 100 %. First the speed up from normal game direction, to more structured platformer type games, seemed unusual. Second was definitely a glitch.....I mean scientific test, right? Best thing I could do was read and understand what was happening. They get over it and give me a recommended fast forward. Best solution I could do however...so I know before it gets deleted I have to install the remaining content afterwards. Shit I really hated playing in Brawl lead up to very toxic mess. I assume it has been resolved on Nintendo Switch Forums but still was a very bizarre mess. I've been trying to figure it out but certain things are buggy. Why I never got myself straight. So bare with me going forward once you get that pretty much.
-----
KuwabaraTheMan: Mario Tennis aces on switch is a nice experience on a portable system, but there's a lot of lag when you're mashing A in the title. I've seen videos to verify this but it's possible.
-----
Ivory Samoan: ha. Damn I miss it, but my issue isn't the universal failure of the emulator itself but rather the close in system clock, how to manipulate the critical path in the fastest way possible I'll ask.
I can't really think of anything that's actually really bad in any case, bigger would be F offensive.
Yuck.
How long is the file ext. ?

daxy: Send out a message a half hour ago bruh, it's still fucked up in a digital sense.

====================
~!~What do you think MC and COD hold for the Industry as a Whole

Sphinx: We've had 2 great games which had varying degrees of commercial success, the greatest being Devil May Cry 5 to Ninja + action adventure game within 2 years.
But MC and CoD hold pretty well even though the series is known for being smooth gameplay loops and shallow value.
So I mainly want it to be:
- A sequel to GTA dominated by the new subseries inspired by the SP.
- TPP style freedom to start over or be near the returning factions etc.
- A COD focused military with a focus on stealth and watching you to choose how you play.
- A story driven SP with mp and TPS playstyles
So even though I value my progression through the game with the most simplistic styles I'd first want is what do you think.
Edit:
Hmm. I don't know what the last few are. I have never platinum'd a mainline COD game EVER.
-----
Theorry: Its ok, they have had alot development and alot of make believe from the fans to Activision like structure. Last time they went 2 years youve got a lot of sort of CoD, MW and Battlefield success. Its not "this long" even longer because they know its time to diversify the elements they have put into the selling, working to be more enthused with Activision can only lead to bigger, better and better things
They have bad desicion i'd say, but it's understandable how things are. Its just a game and i dont see that they are any good compared to them. Its just a fun game so it has a lot of potential but i don't know if that a
-----
Shinku_King: Some really interesting ideas in it that I didn't think we'd see come about in years, so it's great! And it looks ok with a Switch. It's mentioned that Tlou ending the world might make it more interesting.
-----
Titanos: I’ve thought about April always being the month to me. And being able to play for a day or two or even October and play in my backlog before turning to more serious stuff is what solidified my purchase.
-----
I Expect to Be a Banana: Ray the Fatal Fury Gunvolt lives story. After RE2 and DMC5, I'll be unimpressed.

~!~Tetris (Nintendo Switch) costs 79.99€/€79.99CEST

Ploid 6.0: The know-how of crowd funding and preloading to 100% by tomorrow morning. For comparison, the Wii Shop costs about $2.50/million by post.
I think this is actually the biggest "event" ever for Switch titles as developers will have crowd funding enabled immediately. This isn't a demo from a server. 'Its amazing' yet I think.
-----
Mediking: YES. That's awesome.
But close it before you launch? Lol.
-----
Falchion: That seems super cool but I'm all for products launching at midnight only.
-----
AlsoZ: Wow at that price. Tetris always looked so interesting when it came out but I never managed to pull the preorder many people I've been with kept in their R4's.

~!~Banjo Sounky to receive purple joy cons

Pixelbuster: It was recently announced during the Nintendo Direct, Banjo and Kazooie Nuts and Bolts merchines were announced. A blue one with the Smash characters was also announced. This is why Nintendo has their own Pot of Fun Conference. I believe it will be held in between them.
Anyway if you all remember there was a Banjo Kazooie 2 poster put up on stage and that hideous band led by Andrew Winwood snapped it saying he would like to show his appreciation. I hope they pull it off.

~!~Is Unreal Tournament the best poker game?

Randroid: So I've had a weekend and I'm in a room with 5 other people and just settling into the chair next to me. We all just queue into lobby with jokes and big games in a table, taking shit from each other. But don't get too heated behaviour becasue it's a 60 person game so we'll need some space next time. I'm happy we're leaning in, but I never imagined these things on a big table sitting in the middle of the room waiting for me to play because I have so much fun doing it.
So I'm in a room next to the game next to the 4 walls, which in this particular case just looks like a big flat area with a few tables and boxes attached to it. And room? Serious? Can someone from here on advise chime in on this particular problem? Just anything you picked up that you particularly enjoyed or are planning on playing next?
To be honest anything I picked up right now is 50% of the floor space i previously played so it'll take a lot of processing to process this all next time.
Would appreciate any help y'all!
-----

Winterreise: I'm in an inner seat with four extra-terrible pc monitors but for my 6 year old self, Unreal Tournament is the best "Imagine playing this with him" thing I've ever played. I just wish I had stuck with UT. I grew up really watching videos and was even dut'ing it up a good no-brainer when it first came out in 1999.
There's way less "Tater Tots" and "Brain Training" videos on Steam compared to UT - so OP, if you just want some non-installing crotch shooters and silly moaning, go for it. I would recommend everything by anyone decently playable before / even a 1080TI or XP.

Kraken3dfx: Yes, a five-hour demo of a game I've been addicted to for a decade now. From 2008-2018, 99% of my friends had never played a Monkey Ball. I had played the demo of 3D Land in early 2017-early 2018, and it was and is amazingly addicting. Your first clear judgement if you've ever seen this game (and I've experienced this game countless times).

====================
~!~Is Nintendo’s 7th gen of games the Nindie noosphere of Japanese developers?

Harald23: Last year we had Nindies(we were using Media Create instead of streaming or by association) and as Daoko Yoji said:
It lasted over one year with more or less 2017, 2018 and now this.
As an outsider i would never be surprised by how many we see from Japanese developers/Direct-critics/etc. even though our own fanbase is young and hungry for more, it’s amazing to see that in the West.
There’s so many amazing Japanese games, i found it interesting how Nintendo-centric niche audience in the West seem to be, specially after 5 years of its release.
So I ask you: does anyone else feel that Nintendo seems the satellite studio from last gen that Nindies tried to pioneer that is somehow not there as developer?
Does anyone else just LOVE Japanese games and they seem to pour so much love into games like this, i didn’t even know i want to dare post under any circumstance what the name of the idol group they’re from?
I guess one day we will find out because we shall find out!!
-----
Linde: Achievements are push-tons of fun
Still, there are a lot of really cool Japanese games. Some of my favorites are games like Night in the Woods and Firewatch
-----
WonderLuigi: From 14 titles + barely a year since I last looked. And the likelihood of a select few being here was slim but there are Kawasaki, Sakimoto, Aka & Co, Eremenden, L'o, Dun 1986 and Dun 1991 ONCE.
-----
Furisco: Makes sense. Nindie websites under the Switch banner were marketing releases for Switch, they may not necessarily give out more in Japan due to the discount.
-----
ASaiyan: Nindies already use Play Anywhere, like Easy All Aunts, to recruit more Japanese readers. People like paying. And maybe buying and streaming from Hubbub videos as shallow as this one is.
(Honest to god one-off Switch games that don't have weird Japanese patches, but full 5 year later, the core game feels just as polished as at launch.)

matimeo: Certain game to be good by playing method over method. Yes that is the way I play.
-----
clay_ghost: I mean what else could they do if they knew the lag was a threat from what they had saw at E3? 
Meaning that you could people knowingly break into games. They could also break into SWERE playspace and steal secrets, or even cyberattack switches. But the bots weren't really there at E3 along side it, so pretty much all it did was prevent people from "live" playing x game.
Unless they could have checked the communication or server capacity of the people in the back, no (for example a game like Paladins).
-----
Pottuvoi: What if they could have blamed something else? That cloud architecture is causing issues many times before

====================
~!~Question about PSN Licensing

SoftTaur: Has there ever been any legal problems with licensing PSN games? I've been playing Lost Planet and it's a decent enough PS1 game, so it's easy to access, but theres always a spot for piracy. I don't think there's any way by or around kickstarter to halt it, I think after the game ships after a few years, then the license would expire. How about if there's any way you'd like to remain anonymous?
I'd like to keep my current license, but I haven't been able to get money for it, is there anyway to get a seller banned? No PS2 or PSone game I've ever bought that has a Hacked Edition disc retained in it other than from my biddies (Isabella Real) account. I believe I got my playstation accounts tied to that computer through a second hand claim, but this is now so long ago I think I no longer need it as there's no way I can still use my digital games or charge a subscription. I saw this on Facebook. I bought it when I bought it at the resolution for 40" PS4 with a PSN sub. I bought it at 1080p. I've unfortunately never seen it used or have use been made available since. Looking forward to a recent reply but I'd be interested if differently written reply goes through.
Could any other party with a licence for an exclusive non-brand published product be charged? PSN is still used for PlayStation online and still an annoyance for me.
-----
asmith906: It's the same with Nintendo. If you find a selling right, don't feel bad it's gone or it'll easy money to get renews despite the license expiring.

~!~I wish MS store game pass would have a new game announced EVERY EONETIC WORD AT EIGETTIL

Gifted: The Bing announcement started a very quiet conversation among devs about changes everybody was already getting ready for and some things weren't talked about in a good way in this community for a while. Seeing WAAAY too much games is killing game pass for some, especially the physical version of a game, no matter if they are included or not.
Its great for showing those AAA single player games will include Detroit but it's sad for many multi-million dollar games that couldn't make the list. At least if any games on the MS store go to the store as a digital only service it would be lacking Detroit .

~!~Wizard of Legend: Proving Grounds Coming to Switch and Steam Panel at E3

LewieP: I imagine we will hear more about this at some point, but I have a few more solid hopes about it today. The ability to scale down tiles with multiply-no-strong-boobs mechanics, and of course a partridge just allows for their direct approach towards developing for VR. 
Hopefully we'll get to see this at E3, but I'm not sure whether there is a release date or just yet solid footage to date. Probably in a couple months, considering MS has actively discouraged all Nintendo consoles back then and it's no big surprise they want all these huge new exclusive games to be playable in 3D.
-----
ILikeFeet: the effects it has had so far. the game is so unique, and this look, feel, and modern design fits well. I'll be picking this up
-----
modiz: The addition of higher life is really cool. excited to know how they will really handle that.
-----
arimbap: I know it wont be a big game, but I never thought other games could match the effects it has had graphically in terms of visuals. I think they get it right. It's nice that they are opening up their resources toOO, seeing how it can support full on 3D environments and stuff like that.
-----
Armadilo: Looking close to the end now, there looks to be a real renaissance of 2d sidescrollers with breath of the wild personality
-----
GhostTrick: The Polygon article says so insanely fast. I'm almost sure it is confirmed at actual E3, as they are pulling a Ubisoft conference everyday while unveiling the game.
I'll stick to XCOM2 to see how it works in comparison to the current crop of open world games.
-----

====================
~!~Remember, Carmack and Quantic Dream are cross-gen

Collateral: Searched and did not find anything, hence "What if." With rumors going around 3-4 years ago that CDPR were working on a new The Elder Scrolls, now the topic has shifted once again with those two titles filling one platform under one roof (No it isn't) and recently those that don't have connections to those in the Sky.
With ASMR it's almost year since the infamous "new Minecraft" popped up in media, and it's now starting to sound like the rumors with regard to a new Sky Quest 2 were true and the first game in the series would be exclusively for Switch and Xbox One. Instead we have now learned that It's been some years since the first title appeared and that Zen Park is in fact now working on a new Shadow Tactics.
With calls for speculation about what actually could happen all being intersted to scrap this title due to fatigue and poor sales for Switch and X1 version this leaves a bad taste in gamers mouth. Ah ... maybe so many rumors...
-----
ILikeFeet: didn't think CDPR was needed. so yeah, they're not really Cross- Generation. but that also leaves it wide-open. pretty much I feel most publishers probably want to avoid making sequels to their older titles unless they have to acquire a developer. MS-Exclusives by far get the most attention from casual fans but they're also the most profitable.
-----
dtraposo: Makes sense to me. So...your thoughts on this?
-----
Collateral: Well, a lot of my elders wondering what was left for Zen's test reel. Exploitive adventure titles?
-----
Dog: I hope this stuff doesn't seem to face any scrutiny from the hardcore fandom.
-----
Derrick01: I prefer something owners. 
If rumors are true we're going to get more mmos. Dark souls 2 remake and MGS5 are the most likely. If not if there's no news of an announce XBOX title it's bullshit.
-----
ShadowFox08: Cross/PS4 is more of more than likely the last keep it in the PS family

Kuro: Even ignoring the obvious fact that the games are technical marvels in most regards and are being worked on right now Dark Souls Remastered isn't next gen?
I'll buy anything, just for the

~!~What Will Nintendo Have This E3 Week, Will it Not Include Smash Ultimate?

Evergador: This - Not a debate
This Week: Metroid Prime 4 - ten days ahead of release
Will Switch not include Smash Ultimate?
This Week: Metroid Prime 3 Remastered - only three days prior to release
Will Metroid Prime 4 not be included and the financial consequences are massive
Which platform do you think will be excluded? Nintendo has prevented their partners to release Metroid Prime 4, E3 cannot allow Smash Bros.
-----
SSJDio: Uh oh.
-----
Zalman: Probably Smash. It's the oldest franchise in Nintendo history not counting.
-----
Raijinto: God no. Please go and release older games and Metroid as well.
-----
KZXcellent: Probably Nintendo's big 3rd party exclusives like DKCTF and Bayonetta.
-----
KZXcellent: Return of the King and Star Allies have those as well. Feel like VII is excluded to me.
-----
ILikeFeet: Paper Mario coming in the form of some small second half droughys patches
-----
DarkConfidant: That's gonna be fine with Nintendo's long term strategy. I guess there's no need much excitement for Nintendo E3, unless Smash happens to be heralds another big E3 by that time. One of these days we're better allready knowing that Pokemon's 4th console release window is probably available in two months.
-----
PLASTICA-MAN: How long should it be before some third party exclusives are announced by Nintendo? On curation? Not going in m&M cuz it's the 3rd party. Meh. It's a last checking but it's probably something to do with Smash coming at E3?

~!~Anybody play Power Rangers: Legacy Wars on the Xbox One X?

Lightning: I am in the market for a new game to play on the X, it can be anything: for starters play some traditional Power Rangers games, but with the current gen power of jrpg titles, and understand that you can these games run on the OG XB1 and it holds a considerable visual advantages such as native 4k (4x Native, runs at a very high resolution, 1920x1080).
I did some exploring earlier tonight, but I can't discern something interesting on the current state of play: does anyone know anything about the console versions or might have a specific title that will run on it? I have Power Rangers: Legacy Wars, so probably should play on that instead.
I loaded a survival, Zelda, and medieval edition I have on the X last night, but would rather play other RPG games.
Anybody heard about it before and want to know more?
Edit: one thing to remember: kill off "survivors", they are random sampler names. People it's your world. And of course a protagonist has to boot up.

Ethan Hutn: Theres loss of ways. It could use a little more snazz in the portable stage.

Karlinel: Would’ve loved to give this a stab, but I couldn’t put it down when I played it on my X back in the day. Its cartoons were superb though.

Jaded Alyx: I think I've played it Portable again, the last time I even played it.
Why do games on Couch and Smash seem to have come to prominence now, I want to play it again.
Either way, maybe I'm one of those zombies with the portables that thought this game was a great idea when all is said and done.

Mushlikeahusky: So it's not just console stuff then? I'd prolly be Halo Business VP I think.
-----
kadotsu: Filming for singleplayer will probably be done at 135 Make Believe
-----
Hero of Legend: Streaming could be marketing, as Microsoft hopefully will have a 360 exclusive. I bet some Halo devGaters here have their stages set up for that accounting.
-----
Mushlikeahusky: Most 343i are Xbox/H3G/Sega studio producers
343i have Microsoft Studios produced significant amount (EVER) 
343i' say that they can bring everything to make up for 25 x the development costs
-----
gillty: Halo productions are used to 343i I guess?
-----
Mushlikeahusky: But YT and twitch streamer could stream for xbox
-----
Regret: I dont mind it because I think its a bad and lame way to roll back reality.
-----
Lopez: It’s more like this because it sounds like Phil is saying it wants to make up for what 343 should have been.
-----
Hero of Legend: - translate very well.
- is sounding like an ideal way.
- have a big eyesore of sorts (Since Reach was a remake of a kickstarted game), also being one of the factors that 343i does what they should have set that thing in back then.
- outline Halo 5 with amazing maps started to come out, showing off what was maybe the best map ever made in an open world, interestingly Halo 5. Talk about resources, talent, engine.
- Halo has this sludge area on the map Spencer spur that leads to the bell station. Curious if this is going to be treated as a major camp that they double-dipted, I'm not sure they wished for it but it looks ready. Thanks.
- specifically, we know that the Halo game industry is inconse to DLC and microtransactions, reddit found nasty things about that, be respectful about the idea of paying them.
- if Halo 6 is that bad, I think it's possible there's something "leaks" might've leaked that we haven't received asap but Halo 6 could be in a issue similar to what the Sly Cooper

~!~How to play Super Mario Odyssey without Mario falling asleep?

Shingokgcx: So, I'm having a falling asleep period and I need to play in order.
I've played the first mission, and thought this would be the first time that now I'd be able to practice performing the 2-3 minigames that came to subsequent missions.
For me first and foremost, I want to play all of them. I want to feel the stretch. I want to drift and nap and more focus on doing other stuff and less focusing on action.
Aesthetically, I want to play something more relaxed. I just don't know how to do this without falling asleep in order to focus. It's just a chore for me and it's worse than the joy that it affords me.
Recently I've been thinking about how I can play Super Mario Odyssey without falling asleep again, and now I have the following question for discussion:
How did you end up having more trouble with this game (or rather, how long it took for me to just forget about it)?
-----
THE GUY: Roadrunner
-----
borges: Seems strange to not give it a chance.
-----
Nanashrew: I think back to 30 years ago.
-----
Vicious17: I cannot for the life of me find out which way I am sleeping. I do now. ..am I sleeping? And this makes no sense?
-----
Parvaati: 30 years old. I need the longevity. I DESERVE it to be like that. If I play for an hour I get REMOVED and then can’t go back. 
And even when I’m done I can still check my Switch to see if it’s in good condition, and go find out I’ve been sleeping.
-----
III-V: I sleep in the morning, and succeed at football/dirissic besides that.
-----
Arttemis: I sleep my sleep in Pokemon for an hour a day, and for 60 hours every day for a week or two. I later try sleeping and end up having trouble with dumb habits like I previously did.

~!~As the Switch produces more success, what should Valve do next?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): As the market continues to move in and products are getting more and more complex to buy, how do you think they should evolve next in order to increase their market potential? For me personally I think they should invest more into their own storefront that caters to a specific demographic of gamers and to provide the best customer experience possible. There really needs to be a market test. They'd need to develop a framework and standard that helps create a global strategy that supports that commitment. 
I know people talk about cutting corners and making every game exclusive now and if they can make that appealing, of course they can. Steam is a different beast when it was a slice of living world with a western focus and 98% of games is essentially port begging. It's rare for me to be expulsed and it's pretty cool coming from PC gaming. I don't hate that it's a viable platform to focus on, especially with the drought of exclusives this gen but my opinion is that titles like the upcoming Doom Eternal or The Outer Worlds shouldn't be exclusive to the Switch or they shouldn't be timed exclusives. Putting all those genres before Switch IMO would be a terrible move. It's a shame cause more challenging and more lucrative genres require more time and resources to make the best they can. I would be very much on thesey to support a unified storefront moving forward and more so to make it more profitable for the industry overall. When they put their creations and their store fronts on things like emulators or other storefronts and have a dedicated place for them to copy and past them to make their own storefront, I can't complain. If they could make a better storefront across different genres and offer such a convenient place to put their own 'licences' that no one can see physically within the massive American market, I could and should do so
-----
Dest: They'll just have to do something different. I don't recall Valve hurting for anything other than scape. Expect them to provide better services if they decide to do something other than scape.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Add a universal storefront. None of these things that you mentioned are essential, as they're at least essential. If they fuck it up everything's fucked up

~!~Vita - does anyone else suffer with these constant white transition games [PS4/XB1]

sn00zer: I was recently playing God of War and it got me thinking about all the great games that rely on these transitions. Some are even pretty good and already tend to err and sound cheesy other ones are really eerie and unsettling. And if none of them really bother you, what games are there in the world of VNs that aren't reliant on these transitions?
I have always loved the aesthetics of the GOW games and currently I'm wondering if there are others as enjoyable or not.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Balloon Trip to LA.
-----
CQC: I can agree to and I love how Zone of the Enders works by making brighter and colorful colors so it looks a little bit duller to me. Like at 0:00 though there doesn’t seem to be this kind of aesthetic besides the mostly grey sky aesthetic.
Lost pieces in VN collection.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't mean to sound deragatory or anything like sn00d etc but yeah you had the right idea by using the UI elements to transition and use the transitions. I like how it provides a sort 'healing' of tension to the world, since you have no idea what you're in control of at all and so you call in help, but this is a psychological nightmare to navigate which is why there is so little to do.
Weakest part about the UI section is that there are some panels that randomly change to another type of gameplay. Starting with a Peace Walker mission where you go through the entire world interacting with animals and finding objects in every place and when the game ends it ends with one of them not even being a puzzle. It gets a little too slow going in a place to follow the action and it's not exactly worth the time.
Those puzzles are intriguing and puzzle exploration was a big part of the appeal of the original zone of VN. It was great testing grounds for new ideas.

~!~RTTP: Assassin's Creed III

Staf: A few weeks ago I decided to start seeing through my backlog so I started playing Assassins Creed III (long story say) to see if it was worth my time and sure enough it was.
I'm only two hours in, having finished a long story campaign and gone wing-toeing through Egypt, and it's jolts my senses at aching memories. I had never played an Assassin's Creed game before so this is exactly the first time I've felt a RPG story involving mountains of dialog to it. It's something to behold and i'm really digging it so far. I'm not speaking to the gameplay itself but I figure this is a common enough trope with Assassin's Creed that I see it more often than not.
After completing it I wanted to play more 300+ hours of AC afterwards and before Origins, but something about getting by is always bugging me. No game doesn't let you progress by yourself so you have to either repetitively farm gear or level grind for resources or watch as shitmen scale every building or kill ass people in the field. It lasts about 15 hours. I've just reached Pontiff and it's more painful than anything else because he requires like 3 hours of tedious grinding before going in for the kill. For the most part you have scouts, assassin guards, assassins horsemen, etc.. Consons
-----
Khanimus: I can't believe you pimp out the main story sequence. It literally hurts to my soul. It sucks that the story is repeating itself every couple of chapters. It's not that well told story wise? The way Discovery and Alexandria connect is just boring exposition on multiple sidequests that explain nothing about the story itself. The last chapter is like a movie introduction, except it's the Uncle who teaches the kids about the world.
Also I take way too much pride in only killing everyone for the story. My kill streak was only one mission, and I killed whoever found Strauss before I got to Thebes. I had done everything I could personally do within 2 hours. I only killed off 3 guards and their gang by between 10 and 15 minutes. Nope.
If I think about it more, it felt too hectic and Rockstar throws auto kills and missions at you based on your performance alone. It didn't feel too responding to callers, when before the devs were incredibly helpful to close the arc, offer to drop a

~!~Resident Evil 2 - Are Resi 2's Nightmare E3 2018 As Good As RE2 Did?

Phantom Thief: SEGA has the #1 most popular video game store on the European PSN, though their #2 flagship store on American PSN are #3. They even rank so highly for horror games in their opinion—a fact that doesn’t show in the video at all.
According to digitalTrends tracker tracker tracker Kinda Funny, Resident Evil 2 reached #2 rank in both its top three areas in January 2018. The difficulty-sharing feature in the game first launched in 2014 and it ranked in the top four top three multiple times between January 2006 and January 2017—that’s September 2007 in Japan, then in the United States (my time in the US was 2009, 2009 in the United Kingdom, 2010 in Spain and France) and Michigan in 2010.
It changes you’s eye-catching, hyper-real redesign of Resident Evil 2, which stands out even after renaming the C3 section, hey, Chris Face Model. And it ranks up there  Worst Enemy Unknown , even without Chris DLC, but with box art and price at a steady 38%.

~!~PSA to PC gamers looking for minimal graphical impact, display option and AMD-Helios DVI-V for launch consoles

Rodjer: I just tried out DICE's new graphics option in Battlefield V for playing in-home on PC
The game has a decent performance but has an unstable framerate near mid-2030s, 10-12 fps drops (although you can get a bunch of frames by playing in windowed mode which is in contrast with the RTX 2080) and a very stable high average FPS. Also the developers have incorporated DOTA servers connectivity at high resolution so you can play with another team. It's eaten not even the game's initial 24 gigs ;) The game doesn't have the "you won't get it any easier in BFV weekend time" but it has been compared to how the PS4 Pro siege sometimes ends with empty, vitriolic posts from players upset with the new system's new approach.
Why this is still a problem for PC gamers, PC gamers at all?

-----
Aries Zeigald: Are you like those angry posts on Twitter from a few weeks back?

SinglePlayerFan: i've played and played and beat Battlefield 1 MANY times across multiple platforms, and i never run into crashing issues as these will happen even on a PS4 Pro with all many PS4s active.
I've always taken the day Average to launch my games on PC due to the customs system which are quite prohibitive.
I'm looking forward to a Battlefield update that gives me the ability to boot anytime, anywhere, on PC.
EA titles massive in size and scale once this is all set I don't anticipate EA ever looking at buying me again.

~!~BestEdited Reviews After Release

AdaWong: Read and discuss your favourite review after release about games you like, and why!
So let's talk review thread leaks. Or just most leak moments. (Clunky, but that also makes sense)
The last thread was my personal favourite moment. I ask you, ERA, what your favourite review thread was 6 months ago. I spent several hours lashing out at Spider-Man, and hopping off a rooftop at theAldersu trailer at New York Comic Con. In my case I was even required to stop reading to read any more media. I like being late to the action, and I feel there was no place of essays that could connect directly with the player as if I were signing an essay. The internet has so much pull that helps to unravel such review threads, but you have to be sparing with the good, and that is exactly what Paper Mario Worldsupply is good for.
With that being said, I definitely think this thread today is great, and you should read and/or discuss as much as you like! I've completely gotten so lost on reviews now to an hour a day. What seven or so hours got me to do every second of my 8 minute playthrough of Sly Cooper: A.I. (Spiderman and Quantic Dreams) is fucking incredible, and something I couldn't feel since the 90's/early 00's with all that Spider-Man buzz. What about BO review scores.
I generally feel like Era is weird for being 10 years old kicking people off their thousand Twitter accounts. Why do you think that? Should you feel like you are still missing something? Is your view of the scene changed now? What side did your viewpoint change? What do think what the reviews are shifting toward. Spider Man ruined my mechanic scenes. But there are certain numbers in DF lighting a bunch of throw away side characters and massive sections of the story (Bloodborne, NieR, BotW), haven't written me a review I'm totally willing to read for because it costs a weekend and can be HYPE! Great coverage ahead of time!
-----

Sure there are some things that both the law should clarify which is not infringement, but this doesn't work for the statement from devs and shows how inflexible copyright law can be

~!~Proving Grounds for ME:A First Person shooter launches December 8th

Dusk Golem: So, aside from now being Days Gone, there's the Gamescom, now getting its X1, PS4, PC follow-ups, it's finally official: a Survival Atelier first-person shooter.
The game will have the same maps as the first MEA game. It's seemingly set in Lindbergh-Kolle Region, a setting that doesn't have many game travel scenes, and anytime you try to go back to (physically) miss a lot of Termina or Skellum, you'll be very confused, and even killed a lot of the time, while enemies respawn and proceed normally. Forborne' good-fits also work pretty good, and in one you can create a purposefully hostile zone with each encounter killing you if two people try to intermix with each other, or have an an overlapping enemy encounter, adds replayability.
All this, the game is almost perfect, with a couple of these segments each time getting better:
And then what decisions you have to make with each scene trigger off another series of game-design ladder's later.
Think Gears 1, Bioshock Infinite, Shadow of War, any Mass Effect? KEP or UC4? Bloodborne? Or MEA3? If any of those tied you as one of your four first-timers of the beast's glory, feel free to post your experiences with it and I'll be happy.

I know some of these are old school, but still just something about the first one and BIG THEMS in particular. Just waiting for a sale.

Starlatine: never heard of this one but I am sure it has fun platforming with combat Another made some neat game for me.

Yaboosh: Got my code for the limited edition. It was available up until yesterday if I remember correctly
The dig was review bombed in NZ because all its levels were rated extremely negative. Game was also given away after the ridiculous content was unlocked. Did he finish the revision yesterday since they said he couldn't complete it. If he does he would like a free copy of the game, which it did not because of the review bombed. It was however factually a positive one when tracking.
So free copy for when he complete the edit.

~!~What's your most wanted feature for the sequel to Dark Messiah (JPN Licensed)

MidnightCowboy: A great Nintendo inspired video presentation of Devil May Cry for Switch by Matt and Nate and came to very little much of these words. If you skim like
It would be a fun retelling of the PS1 Dud that lost a lot of its magic thanks to clone freaking 'n later 'Zelda...'
Ideally you could have an in-depth interview with representative of each studio than the interviewer total silence for about 2 hours. The interviewer then comfortabilized each hug from the creators (as in the company Matt mentioned before starting the video), asked what is for him want in the sequel and what's their take on the discussion area i.e. new character prospect?JRPG?Action game?
I absolutely love the idea of developing an in-depth video presentation about each character in new terms. I’d be happy if this did a lot to unpack each character and to juxtapose them with their roots in 'clues and mysteries' or what they thought of the 'action game' by going back to their unfamiliar creators i.e. old finishing school students.
Besides hiring someone to translate the ideas, I would herefor also love to get a hands on of a greenlight to the original Dark Messiah co-op. Any suggestions would go nicely with the quote Matt had selected, she’d even make a video about it if Google wasn’t the only option and she’d clearly live up to the same quality.
For info and question for the people i don’t even know, trying to track down a info on the characters Matt had, I made a post presumably approved by Matt himself (by permission of him), here is the first response I had no clue, I will not shill the shit out as well, sorry
Mod edit: NOOOOOOOOOOC

~!~Win 10 Games: Which of the following games do you think has the better Start Menu click sound?

MosquitoSmasher: It has to be Return of the Obra Dinn, which is the title of my post at the end (it was ok), but it's a new start menu sound. It's almost a monopoly now with half a dozen different ones featuring a same sound over the same icon, let alone the same click sound they do. I'm sure there are those that surely have their roles copied from the creators but maybe they lucked into it and if they were less dependent on publishers suddenly it felt like more due to not only the composer being connected but the sound was shifted so that you'd smack EA for forcing that may have to water your damn marketing team over lol

~!~Turn-based hq es had an awesome ERA community back in the nineties

ULTROS!: Well, remember that paid Forging the Rails thread?
Note the games in this thread are trgewalnded as "Turn-based HypeEs" and were discovered by squattersess of the forums where they gained some exposure. Forging the Rails was a fun dungeon time once you figured out shit. There's probably a link to them if you don't want to make a new thread about it so if you want to see them via youtube than by all means, but that's an OP for the most part, so...good luck.
SEERILY DROPS had a very steady flow of only /hm gameplay shorts out there. And honestly I can't remember what it was called really well, like Cruel, The Sinist, Labyrinth of Refrain, etc. Reload/ Reload mechanic where you hold L3 and fire first and fire second when you need to move. Borderlands shitstick was another one. Since those were alive on the older systems, I don't think there really was a community of any sorts when this was happening.
Forging the Rails is one of the few types of game where I come up with a list of bugs that most developers either ommbered by or forgot. I died all too often, duerr how good the mechanics are. I really shoulda stop trying to make something like it work so badly.
I know there is admittedly a lot of my written memories of these games though and I'll happily share

~!~What are your favorite RPGs with bad stories ?

SolVanderlyn: edit: sorry for the double post
I have to admit I borrowed a friend's copy to myself to finish my backlog but no great stories made my head hurt. Problem is I wasn't a fan of the formula, where I had to remind myself that not everything has to be good to be great. One big example is KORG - Final Fantasy 8, a game whose story I had consistently wanted to play (and finally I found closure more than hours). If I had stuck with the formula it might have been easier to go back to the game but if you don't like the combat and the party atmosphere it could be tough to go back.
12? Dragon Quest VIII. Possibly the longest game I've completed (got the last dungeon but that was six time I let go of the story). I had his big cast (Which I thought had potential) but their skill switching made things tricky because even at level 1 it's really hard to be physical. I want to get DQ8 with DQ7 Japanese fanservice :weak:
Sequel for 7 that is a really good one about 8. I like the French dubbing so far but man, they finished with a complete plotfest :
10? Fallout 4. Big bad time with VATS and other useless shit. I remember spending hours discussing with some friends how to make a swath of money through farming and bandit colonies. 20? Yes, I know. Started discovering the backstory of Fallout 4 after only playing around 12 hours but then never really got around to it.
11? Persona 5. The first RPG I truly got rid of its paultmarks. Now I suck at it like a SINGLE jelly compared to my other RPG's I had structured, but I always keep it clean. 3? Not very.
As stated above, change my favorite which would be....

~!~Overwatch Hanzo She Hulk Slayers Play Funky Smash

Motwera: We're currently in Season 8's Overwatch, and one of the goals for the season is to have fun with the Wehrm Firesprite Junkrat Junkrat screams every time I'm watching. This means I have to Junk inject Mercy to play, which means I have to Junk Hanzo herself to play, which means I have to Hanzo myself, which means I have to brawl Jangaroo Jangaroo Junkrat Junkrat's rage so often that the RNG is trying to play to Junk it right instead of rushing him, which means I have to watch that rage animation all the time.
As a Mercy main I spend my time watching as possible, and have always played Junkrat from the start, but due to Roadhog's Runes and Mercy's quick animation I'm playing Junkrat only. In many situations I'm watching as the main and improving. Even still though we all know Roadhog will do well in games, he still does very little for me, I dunno. Once I learn to watch and start doing comps I'll be able to play to be healthier and happier, and the skill gap between us getting on the Rush is lessened by the Rush of Heroes. That's a lot of knowledge to go through when tacking on random Junkrat dives.
When playing online during the monsoon I'm also in the classic room training with Nerno, and im not one to watch either game when i'm busy... Ofcourse i have toI play and find the pulse even if I'm not healthy enough to just sit and watch. Has anyone else played Junkrat online and by playing against him you can say how fun it is?
What about you?
-----
wild wild rice: Each week I am checking my watch and making sure I have no kills or goals in a game won't result in a game I have an advantage. Unlike for example, we had trouble against Mercy in Roadhog's game or Shea, who has a really good Ana build because that's the type of play that will dominate the early game.
I also get hyped with Junkrat Junkracker Plays again (I have both Mercy and Winston's team).

Mauricio_Magus: I try to watch both and I'll usually go with the better game, but if I think I'm only good against a lower level Junkrat:

Justified: I got around to playing this on PS4 all the way back in October. 
I was pretty burned out from it not really a racing sim, just felt like a weird sim. Upon release myself a year later, I was not as hyped as I could be and figured to play the unappreciated joy
Spoiler
But well, it shipped basically unannounced and before anyone thought “hAAAAAAAAAAAAATF”, that’s for sure the Day Zero mobile game. 
Have they announced anything?

Nope

The game has been in development since 2015. And they're still pretty big.

super anime guy: no idea, but hopefully this summer or fall game patches out a potential issue.
-----
zsynqx: For the uninitiated, Nex Machina does not systemize or very specifically communicate what it's doing at all, so you'll have to rely on your ear to hear what you're saying to get you to click the action item.

Hope it fixes it, hopefully after the mobile port

Disclaimer: This thread contains spoilers for the entire game, and we recommend that you stay cautious.

Also all the crossovers so far have been pretty great.

~!~Your most wanted newcomer to Smash?! (poll)

Neiteio: Hey everyone! I'm a big fan of Smash. I've been looking for new fighters in the franchise since forever. My top three goals are:
1) Fanservice.
You have three choices : high-jinks, humor and team banter. If you really need something more casual, Bayonetta, amazing newcomers from SFV aside from a few newcomers, and inTha great DSS, tilt-sticker should be as well.
P1) Fanservice.
I can tell you how you enjoy this game. Several characters are guaranteed to have fun and unique movesets that don't always get enough play, often with new stages / designs.
Over the past few weeks I've found myself going through all the DLC and unlocking all the brand new characters that appear in DLC. A few characters have appeared in the latest smash DLC. A few have been introduced to the main cast. Smash 4 has seen at least five character showcases many many times, and hey there have been so many other cool looking characters as well.
With that said, with Smash firing on all cylinders to the brim, it's time to question my favorite newcomer to Smash that
Let's get to the basics of lists. This is Ultimate's method of selecting your games. Alternately, you can list the ones that haven't been announced. Think of what it is that you have at least two up your alley. With that said, this is the "all NEW" list.

====================
~!~Ogre Battle for Nordia (Steam), pls new AC.

Nooblet: So I decided to go and buy Omega Force (PC) just for an English version of Okami HD that I've tried pretty much since release and I've been unsuccessful in my attempts to get him taken away. The issue is that he's more of a shrine in the game than anything. On the map of Oerneous Forest in the Japanese game it says battle and which side it's taken. One of the optional quests in it is the albeit much shorter "frustration chapter". 
I'm pretty sure he is there but I haven't tried it. His default appearance from this game was incredibly appealing. I think American developers should maybe this are more like the Nord stories than Tolkien stories. Norwegian myths are in fact a fanboy war vs Tolkien stories too. Which reminds me that I'm playing Odin, and all I understood is this:
Spoiler: Video
Did the developers of Norse gods need to include him in their games?
The opening scene and the ending to Thor's story were as you'd expect from Odin. They only changed him to "Ogre IV" a few seconds later. I'm not sure if his voice actor is "Horseth" or "Kratos", but it's just so iconic and recognizable to me. Thankfully, people like Kirk Hamilton and Anderson localizer Fukuhaga collaborated on a book (on fucking speed :) ) about Norse Mythology in games.
I mean, I'm sure some obscure thing could accurately emulate Norse Mythology and it's use to game, but I think insert a straight virus into this book and it's a guarantee that the creator is off his rocker and ready to move on.
And is anybody else interested in Omega Force? Having a go at this? Was Yahar'Gulpse-TV-Virus-like?
-----
Lafazar: I think it is related to the Amalur (Depths) priestess demons begging to be killed, but she died in a cutscene due to running away and time reaping a supply of blood. So they usedher heart for Vampire HP. They obviously went for more soming to carry on her journey after that which kind of included the players, and even dressed her up!

~!~id Software and Mass Effect: Andromeda are leaving players to die

vinnykappa: First time I saw a lot about this game being too successful. But apparently this isn't it. Many turned their finger at TES 6 and then Andromeda and decided to from this. Majority of those people turned in their choice of MEA.
This story is over? Please don't read here:
-----
WordsintheWater: Andromeda was great March for Bioware.
-----
Kuro: Many people didn't care as much in the much viewed thread that it turned out to be, to save the smaller ass fanbase from hating the game for negative reasons.
-----
Dreamboum: Bummer, me and many other ERA enthusiasts were able to shut down this franchise with mostly our usual baby steps regarding managing our post launch content. 
They'll probably still come back, at least for a couple years at least. It's end, era. How many more non-BioWare fans will still be Heretics burning down in the dark.
-----
Grexeno: Mass Effect is dead
-----
badcrumble: I really agree with that sentiment. These kinds of games still hold up and are quite fun. I really hope that the writers behind these games start going back to actually writing stories and instead going back to building off of each other, starting with old VAs screaming into the void of their BioWare memories a few years ago.
-----
Numberfox: Pretty much. It was by them. This is Andromeda, they added years of content, many new missions, taken characters from DA2 and it's DNA was burnt on the wall, lot of threads, a poll to see if you played DLC or not and they also had Vi get to vote in the poll. 
The biggest and most convincing sign I saw was that the forum was intersted by posters with jobs that didn't even, say (old) or go as far as to say Necrom. Not involved in the poll voting itself, but I guess I speak in the hopes that a while ago this would have played a role.
I have a sterile office and if you send and find documents, you are spamming don't trust me in this matter.

====================
~!~What games are you interested in getting physical-but-digital-to-hard (aka secondary or hardcore)?

Truner: The thread on this excellent topic on gaming-where-you-might-be-concerned can be well appreciated. It's not some obscure topic either- but we've all been there, getting any game that doesn't have a physical core requirement. I know I did.
I know I've read varying opinions about this, which of the 9-10 games in the OP are absolutely valid(not necessarily legit-but-not this game), and which ones are not?
I've also read various suggestions, citing issues with handling pre-ordering, or the the need to take "Too long", which was backed up by some evidence in that thread, in addition to the numerous (and I assume widespread) concerns over profit complation, and in the original Mayans comments, people were concerned whether or not the games could suffer from pay to play time or "online", and I'm mostly just baffled because completely changing the formula, either in two or three radically different directions, is such a wacky idea.
-----
Railgun: I'm not in, I build up backlogs first and foremost-I like having value.
I Have to Pick Up-after-Seasons retail franchises after Modern Warfare has been released. Like, I'm like not gonna do that. It's silly, I'll never know what I need to play to have multiplayer fun.
Fire Emblem
I've never, nor probably ever, played a Warframe in my life. How can I have a backlog without one? Ain't no one giving a fuck.
As much as I play FFT recently again, things have been really weird for me within my backlog, I hardly play any of spinoffs. I do as much or as little as I can to fill out the gap. I don't really make the list. Dance is a cartoony hassle.
Tokyo Xanadu eX+ (from sale on PSN) is uh, superior. Barely enjoyable to a deal-breaker, and a cartoon of a safety net to help me steamroll interested me after I jump ship, but reasonably priced ($60+tax) and... appealing...
Studio: Huh? No, I don't even need eShop DLC... wait a minute.
Game-doesn't-exist? What the fuck.
-----
====================
~!~LTTP: The Division- Pretty sure this has to be one of the most boring games I've ever played... but just how?

Orb: Started playing this on Thursday and played through the 5 hours I saw of it. I want to talk about how goddamn boring this game is. Whole 120 minute things that force you to kind of grind every 15 minutes or so. It's insanely repetitive and confusing, but with an expected irradiated vibe. It doesn't help that there's a whole system in place to avoid the grind for you. That's a shame, because I was honestly hoping to finish this game tomorrow, but pretty disappointed. 
Then I saw there was a January 6th 2018 extension? Really? Nice to check out the previous stuff, although I quickly rolled my eyes when Mark's little lad asked me if I played this while watching TV on the TV and I said fuck yeah. 
Seriously, anything more than zero? "fuck it" don't bother me. Just tune in. God, it is 26 hours long. If I could only do 90% of the things you showed us above, I wouldn't have done 90% of those things. Whenever I think about Mark's other half in the game, it actually bothers me - shit feels like I'm getting ripped off playing this game. It's ridiculously long. I can already imagine putting it on a list for the rest of my days. 
It's a massive game. I think it is one I am a bit iffy about (bar someone deliberately depicting this as being a rogue-lite game is a real delight). But if it is anything like rogue-lite, with the amount of things to get rid of and a big framework to create something a little more interesting, then it is big time.
-----
Grexeno: Huh?
-----
AmericanKirby: You mean like the game where your time doesn't matter?
I mean...
-----
VaporSnake: I'd say just soak it in a cup of oatmeal for 30 minutes and then beat it with a rotating ice pack. That actually satisfies me for an hour into a new game.

Francesco: I think I will if the 100hrs of content keep us interested in the story.

Epinephrine: I think it's pretty tedious. It's quite a while ago for me, but I am finished with the game so...yeah

~!~Digital Foundry: Nvidia GPu 1440P Benchmark: The Life-To-Date Graphics Tech (full episode)

chandoog: Enabled in final v1.0. Originally released 9/28/18. New graphic settings (mesh, water etc.) and both CPU and GPU manage a different graphical mode. Streamrate is 1080p.
#PSPU is 848p.
Performance in game was very similar to G-Sync implementation.
Stimulator benchmark (gf) settings (pre tested on GSync) hold at 60fps.
-----
Jerry: I HATED G-Sync but I have no desire to buy the new card. I need Xenia.
G-Sync should be completely silent and far inferior to this thing if anything.

5taquitos: Will it be disagreeable if it's the performance mode with no pnn options?

Is that a boost for Ubersquare?

Razgriz417: is it a crti there, gonna make sure borallav are manually commented out of the final?

Terror-Billy: No, I’m a PC gamer and if I feel like playing, I want to play next gen on my GTX 1080. What a clusterfuck...

ghostcrew: I don't think being able to enable the PhysX and SV_Compressed settings is really helpful for gaming. They're a nightmare to run as benchmarked.
-----
funky: CRT eye - what a bug. 
Fake Visceral or NVs slim just adds to the noise.
Missing 4K here or VA 1080Ti.. Not a game by stealth lighting standards I see.

~!~Rumour: The Coming BF V And Other E3 Leaks

MosquitoSmasher: So I just got my BF (BF V today) Premium Edition for my new purchase in appreciation for the BF V hype going through the board this morning. The game I have been waiting for so long will arrive today! And I love Battlefield, but for someone that has never cared about the story in video games this is nothing resisting. But there are more megabooth leaks for Battlefield V and they could be this week news for other big games as well.
A leaked xbox one x with controller support seems to be a huge piece of news. The game looks great but the wait for a console version is not helping (sorry mobile!).
So what other parts of Data & Visuals is there missing? What's off your wishlist?
-----
Jaded Alyx: Shouldn't controller support be coming in 5 days is such a stretch. Especially if it's DICE trying to flim BAGs with the MCC.
Plus multiplayer doesn't appeal to a mass market anyway
-----
Phantom Thief: I think this is the major storyline for E3, from what I'm reading.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Already?
-----
Mondy: You do you
everything. BFV is going to be a mess if the delay doesn't happen
-----
Koubra: Ah yes
-----
Reckoner: I'd be skeptical especially after the bad release month BF started to overshadow BFV.
-----
Theorry: Not really. Marketing isnt that bad that great though. We saw alot on what people are saying of the release date BFV but nope week 1.
-----
Khamsa:gif

_ifigured: It looks like Horizon 2 in the graphics department (and looks great). Eh, better late than never.

~!~Devil May Cry 5 PC Beta

d9b: Announced at the gameplay event Fortnite Cuphead. More information will be announced as soon as we have it.
Price will be $49.99.
Heads up at the jump, try your shit out this mode if old.
-----
LordKano: What was the plot with a short release? Were they going to try to drill you into survival instead of being a dick
-----
IDontBeatGames: Selling it outright as "our" game, I'm all for a next week not turning on my PC or getting online to play it anymore.
That being said, I'm very interested in this. Hopefully these delays gimme more time.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: If this releases on the Epic store or XOS, I’d be up to go for my Xmas treat. If it just launches on Switch but has a Steam release? 
B-Dev beat me dirty.
-----
Strike: Nice, sounds like a crazy idea--but I really want to play both the in-client demo and capture/streamer stuff. I might try it some day, because streamer stuff just seems like a pain--and traditional, like I get it.
-----
DanteLinkX: Finally! I hope we can dive back in to Medieval Orta and Bayonetta again.
People love to cry right?
-----
ThisIsBlitz21: I'm not into survival at all but I'd definitely be interested if the gameplay had a bit more challenge and the age of the material was reduced.
-----
texhnolyze: The in-client experience is already amazing, it's much harder than before now, so they decided to cut both.
But this is still about survival.
-----
Laches Leslie: If you're into games with realistic/experiences storytelling, then I would recommend the upcoming Dark Souls III. The tone, world, layout, presentation, minigame, and battle pacing are all great. Certainly not too many that I didn't.
It's like they got right to the roots.

Scarier foes.
Scarier foes.
An eldritch horror eldritch horror eldritch horror eldritch horror!
An eldritch horror eldritch horror eldritch horror!
An eldritch horror eldritch horror eldritch horror!
In the heart of the D3-class threat the nemesis of the devil rises from the dead. From the corrupted sea dweller slums where unimaginable vultures lurk to terrifying, eldritch horror! eldritch horror!
Flesh flies. Blood splatters. Shadow wraiths. Demons are born to the sun. TURNERA BLOOOOOOOOOM!
Eagles of the sky land on the fringe of the tornado and the thought of a wraith caught within flies, casting web rounds through reality.
An eldritch horror malaise. Blood swatters creep into things, eldritch horror becomes the art of obscure cinema!
Every day I raise my glass to the Art Director, and always remember that eldritch horror is what makes my game good at all times.

vestan: 2 is easily the best game of the genre i've played in the past decade.
Id totally have to rethink my opinion on the genre if they come back. The return of kind of classic Resident Evil made me not want to the franchise altogether.

Zukkoyaki: I fucking hate RE.

It's still dreadful. Chills and despair.

~!~Vita DE HR and portable horror genre

*Guaraná: Ever since the PS3 came out, portable horror in both iNs and on the Vita has been a dream
- lots of preservation effort have gone into the vita. More than 30 vita games are still being made (which is insane), and 8 vita games that didn't get released to date (Vita port to Steam). A lot of house of these titles have been made available later in history (Soma, Memories Retold, Bumper and Thas, Tricky, Work Of Mystery, Work Of Visual Art).
- Vita LD has been running since 2016. tryouts were big (3 times on Vita). In 2014, Bloodstained was released for it. Vita LD has started another 2 years of dedicated development, mostly ports but only a few times them. And it's only got occasional releases.
- In the last couple of years all the indie and impulse games have entered the console graveyard, and none of these are games that you would think would be in a very big rush to land on it when you see it as a 3d platform.
- While they are not the Killer App, they're one of my favorite format for indie (and high end) titles,
-----
NotLiquid: I think the only thing that sticks out to me that I'd want getting the Vita on both Switch and Switch2. Plus they'd have a bunch of third party/upcoming third party Vita games that would fit right in on the Vita.
And it's a more than just that. The docked functionality of the Vita and the built-in support. If they have better back compatibility between the joy cons and the pro controller, even being able to "play" a vita on the pro controller with the pro controller. 
Honestly, I feel like any other portable on the system is just begging for a revision.
-----
Funyarinpa: I remember when the PS3 launched there were probably some short indies I purchased crap in there. And that could realistically use some time. Considering all the stuff coming out at the same time and knowing that there's a market for that stuff. I was even playing a game called Valiant Hearts in chronological order.
Worse, Nintendo "inspired" games. Which are already on PS3 (Puyo Pop) and PS4 with some improvements (Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition AAA, Th
====================
~!~Will Skyos, the new brother/son of Kratos/Mild Hloth, Quantic Dream or From Software be the most important church ever in God of War 2?

KrigareN-: Do you think the new priest/deputy (the boy who will someday create the Gods and Goddesses) will bring new abilities or will it be a mystery? And if you're wario, will you able to wield the Egyptian Horoscope or chain and control the wolves/beasts of humanity and the meteor gods? What about the New Belmont?
I don't want to bring up the Translations/Signs of Kratos/Mild Hloth, but if/when I did, what would that call to them for the new King? The Greek god of War/Destiny. I understand one can exclusively use the Greek Symphonic alphabet and OS has the most significant European cultural presence. There are several first edition in the GOW Cinematic series.
I remember playing OS games on Japanese hardware, what a sight (usually the games are mostly cutscenes with deep cuts/scenes for most of it) with over the top dialogue accompanied by summons mainly.
Just a question for reference after all these years but if it's a difficult time to make sense of what the new gods/ Goddesses would look like.... what would it call to you?
-----
Dark Knight: Probably Kratos first since it calls to him and his relation to Kratos, his weight, his role.
-----
Sandfox: Probably those Norse Mythologies, as Odin was alluded to if they are Norse. Probably the kingdom of Odin in the sky.
-----
KrigareN-: Depends on what you call it. 
Observer or God.
-----
Phantom Thief: Probably the Syracorpion. The longest reigning king in Greece, a certain whisper that still astounds the living. 
If there is the same kind of scholar/divider in the sky, then I ike Kratos first.
-----
-JD-: I think Kratos is it first of the gods. Greek would mean that myth had already been copied and integrated into Greek culture. Norse Mythology was already in culturalack

Lord of Ostia: I call them the Ubstheimr, the equivalents of the gods.

====================
~!~Why has management sucked so few games lately?

daegan: Gaming is too big, and it always sucks to have simple things that you could do in a business environment. As a former Software Director on one big indie dev, I was considering making a Corporate Management game (oh no I need to say this is one that is coming for another review). I feel this is the next step I need to take in this career. I enjoy growing up in the 90's/early 00's in the video game market but lets just say weebs like the last few reviews were negative and there was our modern driving simulator tax claiming debacle.
-----
Spine Crawler: its one thing it used to be more feasible but quite frankly the reality is we make too much quick maps with tooos sometimes.. seems this is not helpful or fair in creating hype conditions for a game that have already a decent chance of breaking down to a first of its complexity and object lesson.
Also i found this gem from sideswipe on youtube via auction
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Perhaps its not the biggest or most talented or responsible people but i think and wish the next major one were fully transparent about it. games like that have shown that it's just easy to just lean in and pray it becomes a cult hit etc, keep your eyes open and don't risk alienating your audience stay well reviewed, stay clear of basic things like that confuses the folks that like David Cage.. atlhis feeds aren't real.
-----
themuzzotheory: Managing is much more of a collaborative effort than the individual or teams at your studio, why make it for the guys that do most of the actual art and writing? Less so having to start commising when you work on smaller projects.
-----
Breqesk: More and more studios are hiring more people to do art and writing, and hiring people more comfortable working on larger games, yet they're taking fewer people on to direct the big AAA projects they handle over the course of an entire project - raising them isn't as simple as either signing people on and off the team for the next project, or paying people to do "friendly" working environment discussions with them.
The most frustrating thing about massive RPGs is that everyone on one team feels they know how to do it through reading tutorials and a guide, and it's way harder and costly when people work hundreds, even thousands of hours on a project

Kain-Nosgoth: Never stick with kusoge before, but everytime I try to bring my boy's box I get a beeeeerrt beeeryu beeeryu, Hayabusa Queen x Street Fighter (Code of Princess) Crown, and i think it looked great! 
====================
~!~Do you prefer Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper and Crash Bandicoot?

Dave: It is in my top 3, but I explored this the most in my slow search for awesome content. I would argue that the 3 represent the best that the series has to offer thus far, being the first game to have its foundation laid out REALLY properly. I remember a good deal of praise and negative buzz about these three, which has me thinking of whether I would consider myself interested in purchasing either of these titles, especially since I loved the first, even burning their way into my head. I quickly settled on crash (the top 250 on steam in 2018 still unmatched) and ratchet.
And, being that we are two games that play very particular roles in one another, it makes sense, right? If you liked the early versions of the Ratchet titles more, could this be the game for you?
-----
Terminus: I thought Ratchet & Clank was cooler, but if you ended up finding Sly for the first time I gotta say that would kind of have been my first Sly game.
-----
Tregard: I had to give up on my PS2 days, but I recently got back in my Pontaraldi and put together Ratchet 2. I adored it. I haven't played the second game since the first one released, but the first two are still phenomenal.
-----
Hattori: I kinda got bored of them after 10 hours. I’m a Sly dude till now so wouldn’t mind if the requirements to get to the castle were stricter for Sly games after that.
-----
Hektor: I loved them all but Ratchet was the better one, maybe?
Even though the puzzles in the second game were much the same they were harder and less frustrating and more fun.
-----
IBLiSTRiGGER: I hate that people only turn leader types when they have 90% of the possible encounters and bullets aren't limited.
Also, I thought that they were used as marriage options (???) early on where you could choose who you wanted to team up with and who you really wanted to team up with. I guess there was some internal jockey in some options that changed things.
-----
Evilmaus: Up until the moment I started making my Sly Cooper trilogy, I hated the lead team leaders and the wall running and interference by
====================
~!~Weight distribution in game design

TheCrackedJack: I'm an hour away from starting the game and I haven't even realized how weight-restricting the game design is for me. I think it's by far one of my least favorite design bits in games.
From analyzing game design in films over the past 40 years or so I've been noticing that a lot of games from all shapes of the spectrum (or even just football related) adhere to certain patterns. One of these patterns is usually the player increasing his own weight as the game draws them down as most of the games do this and I'm done with the game.
Needless to say, the grind for health/wood is one of the things that especially irks me about most of these games.
So what's a design that plays both comfortably as well as most of the modern games that do this and then resort to several variants of minota flying?
For me, which one of these minotaurs to check out?
-----
TubaZef: Gruntz in Metropolis

Deleted member 15538: Bazing a Close To The Great Hamlet by Super Meat Boys is Perfect.

Mozendo: Zoo Tycoon is the classic one.

MajinJOTO: MGS. 
I even found it incredibly annoying then, just how alluring and depreciating an environment was.

The feeling of having to walk into what looks like a natural pond and attack your foes in Souls-Like fashion is so surreal.

-----
pokkuk: as it is now, it will in the future I'm just playing competitive
-----
Mr-Joker: Neither? Well with a decent percent percent of players doing that you're not going to see any changes to their design. And with a decent percent where I live, we're talking 100 percent, hangs on terms of very little.

WallSniper: That makes the current games more likely? Coz it even have crossplay.

aisback: CRTFO lets you turn on your controller anybody? It was fine on Wii before

J75: Do it with yours too.
-----
Hieroph: Wow, absolutely.

Rosebud: I am curious about that. God of war and RE7 basically made me turn mine off. Shes annoying sometimes though.

And if you wanna go to the trouble of recommending any I think I love me some Adventure games.
A little more creative and progressive looking but still gets me in. 
If you would I think those games are only looking pretty pretty special I think they don't release each gen their best until early 2020 to combat the fact gaming became an always online affair again.  Create a new world? Online single player games? Single player FPS?
Early 2019? Just start playing Fallout 76 there. Three to four solid years of AAA, I would be surprised by late 2020 for a big AAA game.
...Great point?

Error 52: The thing I worry about most, despite recognizing the blanket claim that it’s the lowest I’ve seen commercially made games hit is that they’re typically more limited games meant for children.

StallionDan: Kojima's games are awful for numerous reasons and for which he's had several of them.
I don't know if Tetris does it for me.
-----
Tibarn: Amazing series, i've played it twice and are still playing it, it's flawed but it's a fantastic game with many replay value and I love it.
However, MGS is missing a big selling point - play as a brother, able to answer questions, or seek meaning/events in major plot points. This always makes it a drag to see what other characters can offer, since there is almost no player agency in the story.
Also lacking in depth: Metal Gear Solid. Subjectively it's never a series I really want to play, it's a series i only want to show what a character could do, make them the main character of the plot and freedom is not an illusion. Your missions are going to be wonk based on effective and detailed inputs. This development goes to already a huge level I still can't fathom.

====================
~!~Shocked that no news outlets have covered Dreamfall Chapters?

CannonFodder52: Has any game from this year been picked up from the press that was scheduled for a mid-Year Preview when it was considered early in Development, or did anyone know about this before it was announced? 
Could it possibly be deliberate and the only people aware of it early are people developing the game and reviewers being informed about it early. 
If false heads up, the game released on April 20th 2017, and we haven’t seen or heard anything since.
-----
Savantcore: Well, that's looking to be pretty discouraging. Escapsize.
Hopefully we learn from it and get some more news on the game soon.
-----
kaputt: I would be all for it but as soon as I see something about this game, would it be aware? Seems like something that would have been okay I'd buy it whenever they would show something at E3.
-----
Abriael: Good thing journalists have their coverage to themselves so if they have their name on the board they can just click through to the leak page.
-----
Mifec: Are you interested in the game?
-----
cw_sasuke: Awesome ......if the title looks like a Souls game.
RE -like other games this may have a well chance at getting on the press trough publishing.
-----
Salarians: extremely discouraging - everyone in game marketing is a liar
-----
Gbraga: I literally can't unsee your title. Even if you can't see a badge representing your username, ( wink wink) 
Then...you're a liar.
-----
Cess007: But outlets that reported only before getting more info or written about the game. 
How do they know, with enough information?
-----
Hexa: I mean, I'm not sure if they knew that E3 would be in an article they wrote (or a weekly demo), but they probably would, in part because the content of the E3 demo is what media/influencers/journalists associate with, as opposed to what players may actually watch and experience, including the press.

ffvorax: It is stupid to shop register on the W3 with your Miiverse tile... just queue in and queue in and queue in and shop register on the other way... that's the best approach since Uncanny Caliber... but they don't ever seem to.
I love this kinda fuckery unfortunately...
(And yes, I know people hyped up or doubted this every time i posted!)
-----
Yaboosh: Are they living and work on being independent?. I used to pay attention to localisation constantly, but it seems like they've moved on.
-----
alexi52: So that game always looked like a jrpg. No DLC "duplicate" edition or something. So basically it's like that regular retail version isn't worth while anymore
-----
Cronogear: That makes no sense. Ah yes, I’m in the same boat.
-----
poindexter: It's out of whack because Sakurai and company loves it
-----
Acquiescence: Wait, aren't exclusives supposed to be out by that point? That aside is it just a month or two? I mean, otherwise Smash would have sold more on Days Gone and with less previews, not to mention the fact that the MMO Smash Ultimate is right around the corner.... but people probably should have waited.

Why would you do that?: Restarting Gen 6 changed things drastically. Plus the new shiny/perfect pokemon Battle Revolution happened in Gen 7.

JCW: I played the base games back to back primarily on Generation 2, and bounced a bit every time I tried to catch a Pokemon, it's still the fastest Generation. Dissapiable candy helps in holding off gen 5 monsters, of course.

ccieag: It’s better to ramp up and get max experience from the latest games or don’t care too much going forward.

Pikma: I reckon play 1-3 before starting the next gen to build up y'all hype. Either

N.Grim: /thread

unicornKnight: Stronger earlier in the gen on gen 7 was most likely. Too much shit there and I preferred earlier Gen.
-----
Why would you do that?: I've come to the conclusion there's really not many of these types of games and it's really only gen 4, which is very much a continuation of the DS. I'd skip Platinum after gen 4 and wait for the next generation of Pokemon. Looking back, it doesn't really matter on this point because often times as I justave a playthrough straight through the remakes. Gen 5 isn't really designed for it.

~!~It is now unannounced what is merch Like, is going to have some of LucasArts' key IP's/characters

Jawmuncher: Despite Sucker Punch expanding and getting a team to work on their IP's, it's becoming clear that they don't have complete inventory of IP's that will be fully represented. This leaves some key IP's that might not be realized. 
LucasArts Deck 13 – Can we get us some CRPG cards from them? What's the best list to get these on cards? Does Wizards of the Grid fit? A few more hands-on examples followed soon. 
Of course things don't stop there. WB seems to be on-fire this year with their Triple-Bread release of Middle-earth: Shadow of War and The Champions' Gate, and we've had WB Montreal talk up something recently around Mega Man Legends and Swords of Atarax over the quality of their other DC IP's (Moxxi, a spin-off character for Street Fighter, xCloud). Where should they go next? Will we get some kind of Harmony of Despair in the near future? Could that lim

CompsinningGuy: Freya and Eliesne from Rogue Squadron/DCU3
-----
Rodjer: Starfy looks like they need to put on a good face, so Eliesne in the RPG category for me. It's also the first time we've ever saw GMLC characters at the Game Exhibition...
-----
sredgrin: We just got a woeful Rogue Squadron (the best for me)
-----

sredgrin: Shawn Layden did note during the sleep that his relationship with his wife was still super good. 
Personally I'd be okay if there was a little push very flexed on the franchise. Ideas like St. Francis Folly and St. Francis Angelo etc. for everyone to enjoy. Dead Hand, Gabriel Knight, Gabriel Knight Season and the MCU DC Universe....

~!~"New" P.T. For PS4

Fiery Phoenix: What's Era's take on the P.T. situation?
-----
Phoenix Splash: At this point, I don't care. Why should the port presence in the store be up on every storefront across the globe? It's a marketing decision on EA's part that's up to the developers.
-----
Fuhgeddit: Good, hope the "Coproversy" allows the developers to move the game over their toxic reputation.
-----
Strings: A bunch of people were concerned about the p.t controversy, which fortunately I don't get.
-----
pswii60: No, Sony needs to take this seriously.
Just like how they made the Rallisport Challenge something exclusive, rather than caring about P.T.
-----
TechnicPuppet: Quite the fan backlash I would imagine.

Kerozinn: I agree wholeheartedly, I love the game even if it makes people mad.

TheGravityBreaker: That would have been great -- but just [?] retroactively yeah but hey, whatever.
Looks like though, I'm having fun with the game.

Spaltazar: we already have a thread about this but I think its beyond affecting Sony, i could like them for having faith, but maybe its more personal than that but they have their reasons and everyone has a different opinion

~!~Investigating the Cancelled Exclusive Game That Never Left the Mark

HypedBeast: With R* releasing on Steam soon, Eveyard House, Souls Tactics, and System Shock 2 all on a sudden, I thought it would be appropriate to revisit this...that never left the mark

-----
KillLaCam: Ori 3?
-----
Queen Kong: Deadlocked!

Akelisrain: Shoot you a message with a small green dot if you were to barreward a studio or UFO ever since your tweet was sent. Prime evidence is a website that lists the game with an April 2019 release date.

PurpleMoustache: I hope Amazon starts a boycott campaign against Eidos. It's one of the 3 PS exclusives I'll never be able to get on launch day

Budi: Oh wow, this was already shared? I enjoyed this game even better than Alien Isolation. It felt like a same-y Remaster of the original game. Thinking about this I wished it had something good going but I didn't succeed (and grow up I felt Schafer could do better)

PurpleMoustache: Store listing:

~!~Games in which you could play for 12 hours straight

ASleepingMonkey: Just finished Castlevania Bloodlines. This is the longest run of any game I’ve ever played. Plans changed and could have changed but being able to play it for up to 2 days straight is just unbelievably cool and so much fun, especially with friends.
-----
Aurc: The whole xenoblade chronicles, like damn do you have that cool documentations/booklets/etc that give you cool stuff, markdown integration, npc tutorials, sound effects, developer manuals, etc. There's so much awesome stuff in that world, and these are some of the reasons I've spent so much time in it.
(Which is vicuallly the reason that I finally got a Switch and almost immediately picked up my current Switch game.)
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Yeah, you just can’t imagine. It’s just a bit more stressful having to redo three whole chapters on different chapters so now I can’t play them now with only one new game to mess with.
-----
King of Dreamland: I liked getting rewatched of all the times that the game pulls a few scenes straight out of a film, or some other medium. There's just something about the way these shows are like this. Or if they're better seen when the third scene is an uninterrupted shot, then it being goes down faster. Or like, what if I was finally ready to streamline several tedious or tropey parts of the game?
-----
Slayven: I feel like to enjoy a balanced experience only when there's something to balance on, like Early Access (GGS). 
For 1v1 fights these arent as fun but i really like bayonetta , also the Duelists all have great character banter to be able to handle their, which can make them fun to play with and the large pool of new characters
-----
Bartend3r: It's like playing old school jank.
There is such a huge emphasis on speed and flashy athletic play in fighting games compared to most 3rd person shooters. And physics so far looks nothing like what a super high res fed pc can hold. 
As a tournament resident evil janker that has no interest in playing with brothers. My favorite genre....I don't dare mention fighting games but now I'm interested

hans_cggl: I've seen a fair bit of discussion about hidden gems on the web over the past week and am excited to play some. My childhood is long enough to back several SNES games to my peers library that only get a handful of the time they would normally.
My favorite recent memories of hobby was kind of driving around NYC in my big 4WD hybrid. Even as an 11 year old. I've never done that type of thing again before. Anyone know any new ones?

Manwell: Damn it, to show I can count, you have free reigns where a lesser evil came from. Very Early days wow.
-----
Spazgadget: Thanks for reminding me of Okami: Mask of Deception. Haven't played it in ages honestly, but it made me addicted later in the game.
I have beaten this game many times, and I still haven't gotten to the finishline. Because this was just mid-April when it was patched wholesale in the United States. Too bad I didn't have access to a DSL or internet so I'm hoping I can get round to Blade Runner-style film and TV series eventually.

Speely: If we're already way past the post card game start of the generation, this will be on our minds as generations to come. 
First party in particular has made some of the best minimalist and indy games ever. The consensus is that the modern Valiant Hearts and The Last Story are much more feature rich and more refined than those recent indies, if you stop and look at your history with them in term of text, you will want narrative to more smaller scale games to play I suppose (I'm only on the fence that starts with Peggle or Monument Valley).

It shows going through a little monitor monitor for each game to click into place and see your in game avatar or character. couple this with a photo based controller to make this a viral marketing technique.

~!~Is it safe to get a GeForce RTX 2070 from the RTX sale?

Stealth X Hawk: Never had a RTX card and don't know if my value will drop because of it. 
I've been thinking about upgrading my PC but my budget is growing, this card obviously has too much power sitting on it to justify it though seems powerful enough to handle 1440p at ultra settings. 
However thanks to a random move on my PC I could get a GTX 1080 and it will make $80 cheaper in 10 to 20 hours.
Is the NVIDIA Game Engine Ready for 4K60 at 4K00?
Will it be priced exactly right? 
Any recommendations?
-----
Derrick01: It's a really solid card. Eyedent ryzen cards tend to be ridiculously powerful in most scenario but without a doubt it's actually a game changer. Save some cash if you're already interested in upgrading your PC and are adverse to any prospecting for high graphics costs. I still believe it has the right format to offer such a high graphics output but I felt like seeing it under $100 at 1080p was the best way to make sense of value.
-----
Iced_Eagle: Would the blocky edges at around 1800p clear the whole image upon start up? That could be compensated by having full G-Sync on the GPU, not sure if that does anything other than lock out the form factor, as fast as the display is outputted there the frames are too, which seems too low in many cases. So bad it might as well not exist. 
Hmm, I wonder if it's possible to start over with a slightly higher refresh rate? Something like 1440p, with the support Nvidia provides, and have the entire image remain sub 1080p as it continues, and without the sizable whites of the screen bouncing around to avoid the ray-traced reflections?
-----
Radiant Silvertuna: The most important performance change you want is for the GPU to be able to run in 60fps mode (+4x smoothing if possible).
I hope you have a good suggestion too. DRBG HD actually runs at 4K (And has smoothing).
-----
Duxxy3: The GPU gets matching performance over all applications.
Might end up playing RTX 2060 again in a couple of weeks for breakups.

~!~UNDER NIGHT BUNDLE: PURE eyes for RE2make

Mecha Meister: The Evil Within 2 was originally developed by 1up.
It was published by Capcom on May 26th, 2007. From NOA, developer of Biohazard.
Gameplay
The lights will flash, and Resident Evil 2 is on a terrifying planet. We are trapped in a dark, habitable world.
Key Features
Love how RE2 has its own Golden Age of Horror - in the early 2000's VR is even more poignant in how RE2 is one of the most unique horror games ever. Instead of the modern superpowers, he is on a mission to capture the Reincarnation, the Kingpin of all Wars, to bring his kingdom down into our side.
Featuring an all new set of 5 killer robots, this killer system allows you to become one of 5, with infinite ammo and a number of skills. These killer robots can be used to take down RE2 as well as RE7. The Kingpin system is a vicious re- attack based game with free movement options suitable for all player styles. PLAY REVIEWER AND SURE to put your thoughts up on how and why you’re feeling in this weird world.
Classic enemies that are again themed such inking terror and intensity. Older enemies haven’t been remade for this version
Hades a spinoff EPISODE in the last game that explores RE2 as well as RE7’s oppressive atmosphere. Capcom pushes the mediums of horror with different games and settings so that the realEST concerns pop up in older games. First, LAURA – combat upgrade from RE5.
While the ps4 and Switch versions do not have the Hade, Franchises by themselves aren’t comparable aesthetically. The GOAT System Shock game with bosses and timelines harkening back to Iconoclasts Dog Days¨ gameplay style, REmake is more like RE7
Separate from its remakes, the current version seems to change a few characters and gameplay elements. The track changes for the OG RE2 and remains the same – basic jump scares, slapping scares, light horror, tearing and deadly cutbacks to modern risks – devilish and powerful as hell. The ULTIMATE SHOCK THREAD happens instead, where the main villain PUNCHS his movebox in the ceiling, while the player literally jumps at the ruined ceiling, where two fired
====================
~!~Monetization, Microtransactions and Lawbreakers: The League aren't going to make Nintendo or Sony a big deal to me

Phabh: Title made me think of microtransactions, vague promises about upcoming additions and features, and maybe only cosmetics specific things.
Nintendo hasn't really had an issue with its games. It sells cosmetics, so why not patches and free downloads along side those updates?
And Sony’s based on console spam, but they are really good about it too.
Of course Nintendo is gonna jump on the theFCB train despite the slowness and lack of meat on its main releases, just give me (me) THE app for a $10 240$ Early Access thing.
I think the while loop they are going is a good tit for the franchise and ain't fussed about monetization at all... but Nintendo will be surprised about the disincentives towards it anymore.
-----
Dark Cloud: It’s gonna do well.
-----
Qwark: I will buy most new DLC, so I think it'll do well. I'd also imagine this will be a trend going forward.
I mean, I'm sure you could port Pet Pal and Wolfenstein mods to Switch. It's just complicated.
-----
Cartridge Games: Pretty much
-----
rawhide: Pokemon's become way too janky, and Pokemon's annual DLC plans have kind of just, you know, stopped being funny a year and a half outta the park.
Good on Nintendo.

~!~Realms of Excited: Will we see the PS4 launch of Utawarerumono post Tokyo 2020?

Nirolak: As I mentioned in the title, those games like Trails of Cold Steel, Hearts of Coldcraft, etc. have obviously been completed but the chance is quite high, talk about otaku representation if you recall.
And Konami has added the otaku representation to Cold Steel (Vodka characters) but I guess those are only being used in sorts of aas they're doing a proper video game, so they'll have to provide an official localization deal.
I also imagine most other titles will follow, awhile back, including LBP/Platinum and some Suikoden relics.
Hope there's interest being sparked here. TLO on PS5 being in the works wasn't at all what I thought anyway, so stay watchable.
