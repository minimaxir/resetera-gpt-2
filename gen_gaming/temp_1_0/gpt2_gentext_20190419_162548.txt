====================
~!~Which game based action adventure game do you recommend?

Enrico25: I will vote for Super Mario Odyssey, Ni No Kuni, BotW and I think Ni No Kuni has improved and is much more what you think.
And I would also recommend that there are much more games based adventure games like divinity main narrative, but Titan Quest is by far my favorite.
Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a pretty good roguelike but it gets a Black Ops vibe and you can just wander around that place without alerting the hostile AI or anything.
Undertale is a roguelike Souls like that and it's amazing.
I suggest The big bang hd if you want meaty but BOTW isn't a game based at all and you probably won't even want to learn anything about it.
-----
Strings: Not sure why you're asking about adventure games, indie games is there platform gap and the more popular genres nowadays have learned to leverage stealth mechanics better (and it's easier for AAA devs to do this than popular genres doing so). 
I think your questions are confusing, OP. I'd also suggest Hollow Knight & Celeste.
-----
ThatOneGuy: In your party the Celica people already prefer.
-----
Bartend3r: Operencia Chronicles is my man. Can confirm love it.
-----
JK-Money: Persona 5
-----
ScreamingMadden: Similar to me as well here..
How many of those games do you consider AAA?
RPGs are more your speed, just look at the bargain bin for a ps4 or otherwise.
Something more GoW.
-----
GibdoInferno: Binding of Isaac, for whatever difficulty/budget you're in.
-----
HououinKyouma00: The Baldur's Gate series. Never played a 3rd person sidescrolling game with a party narrative.
-----
Kyoufu: Yo-kai Watch.

OhNo: Xenoblade.

~!~Should Nvidia's also next generation (R)actic go "low" to "gamers" and "lootboxes" (gamers themselves)?

delete12345: [Speculative] That we finally see more adoption from enterprise level vendors of the power consumption and cooling of Nvidia's next generation cards and memory modules.
I also think this hypothetical is simpler than what consumers and games need to act on. For once you take off the old boxes from the environment. And that leads to me thinking. That power consumption and cooling are not enough.
(more precisely, can you imagine how much CD-ridges sell for at the moment? If not the same vendors? Virtuous and Logica sell lower, but sell somewhat more for higher-profile titles? And eBG seller for 20$ at Humblebarn?)
More in the abstract: 
What does all this mean for the industry and consumers?
I'm not asking someone to defend a box, or whether it's deserving of a "marketpass" or something like that. Would people still like the way I do and want it more? Does any worthwhile purpose require me to pay $20 (?) for when there are 8 other boxes for redundancy's sake?
Exactly. Does it really bother anyone and how dare they evaluate consumers. Does the market let unfair or low-traffic games and others into consideration?
-----
HMS_Pinafore: To consumer market, yes relevant peripherals like Nvidia cards become big enough to be called consumers.
-----
Mercador: Consumer market is wayside when people believe publishers can make games and services 'greater' by commiting to those flaws.
-----
Error 52: Consumers in this space aren’t really interested in anything like that despite all the games coming out all the time.
Take multiplayer in Rocket League, for example. You’d be interested in unlocking certain mocks and brooms for three or four days, until the prices were eventually raised. Consumers don’t care about trophies and cosmetics, that’s about the type of game that most people play (ME), it’s in that category too.

Eolz: The thing is, this is all a form of protest, let's see the outcome of the way the industry operates in "the future".
If you can pay for cloud save support, then publishers will pay for dedicated servers too even

Congrats on a great game!

bigwinnerx: I need to jump back into this. Had an Vampire re-imagination 5 years ago and had that one beautiful night on screen. Wonder if that re-imagining is what caused the "her" to become so scary in the first place.
-----
Valdega: I remember the old Manfred scene. They nailed that.
-----
fargodog: From what few scenes I have played (and everything in this game), they definitely did a great job capturing the panic and terrifying moments of those madmen in the mall who were right on the guy who had the knife in their head and said, "We got the man's neck, we just got it, you want the quick coffee?"

bear force one: Those blocks in the forest reprise their look familiar sounds, i'm wondering if they relocated the speaker or something. :/

ILikeFeet: that just looks like the giant groups all laughing out loud right now, sure they could have deviated more, but this was just the same zombies group that we were used to. it used to be quite tense

~!~[Meta Data] InS4M: World of Warcraft's latest expansion buffs had leaked.

Dazraell: Some of you might know Mortok, MoL or MoI as the new protagonist from the first Diablo game and the antagonist from Diablo Heroes. His theme for the Blizzard World (the LoL novels) is his belief that "I don't hate my death", which goes further than everything else or his new relationship to Chromia in Heroes of the Storm.
The leak on August 28th exposed his true potential, which he said:
He was endorsed by Blizzard's Creative Director and Director, Koshien Salu paid his official title of Creative Director of World of Warcraft Shirohan at the same time as Shin Kurohiko
The original upload for the (for information) leaked version below.

Yoshichan, who comes to heart after being dumped and losing his mother and other family members to a serial killer in Cataclysm, finds himself back in the world of Warcraft in what appears to be a early period of development. Yoshichan (

~!~What are there to take from Persona 5 Final Question marks PS4?

Oheao: Due to the absolute variety of answers of fans and participants, I think it is a good idea for a thread to collect them. I was frequently reminded of thoughts from a friend of mine that no longer play this game and wanted to share.
The Kotaku article is below, but if you want to know some more information about the game sources, I would also suggest reading the first four pages of the final video, on Persona 5 Reversal Cuts (p.84).
Though as said, they highlight some core themes that are similar to how all games are told and virtue, as well as mechanisms that allows you to play your way to the true ending. They discuss how this is part of the core appeal of Persona 5.
Let's discuss!
-----
Stairouais: The storyline was just so unnecessary.
-----
MP!: Dissidia card cut-scenes are incredible
-----
Starlatine: 20 years ago your favorite plot is still your favorite anime today:
Your favorite gatcha is your favorite gacha system. I never knew gachas to function like life simulators or gambling dens but they're just a fun part of the game if you stupidly got one.
-----
FluxWaveZ: While FF6 is getting a new PC port down the line, this also amounts to a new type of thing for nowadays browser games.

Heartskips: They never have an Id real life musou.
Feeding time limit mechanics, more time to move between Personas and Live dancing.

Oheao: But in all honesty on what I do every time I see something new in the Persona series, I only feel hype every time I'm mining a video about.
PS: There can be the occasional ups and downs and I wish the people at Atlus would still work with that.

~!~A Reginited Characters: Puzzle Fighter 95 best gaming archetype

Onimusha: Despite its simplicity, Puzzle Fighter is more complex and flexible than most fighters typically. Part of this is because many of the characters are deadlier than they. 
One robot, Ryu, is now immortal and has reached generation 8. One generic robot, Ken is out and has reached level 5.
Normally, one "cave of fame" has to be a location in a fighting game and thats pretty short!
I was captivated by the premise notion of this game when it was originally released in 2005.

~!~Great games at the $60 price! That is my condition but everything is a steal

GhostTrick: Has anyone ever had this problem especially when it comes to PC games? 
Firstly, I bought God Of War on release day to be on right upon release. Bought it as patiently as I could and completed it within a week. I payed 100$ for it and I felt right scoping out the time to finish it before I wanted to buy it for more. When I disconnected RDR 2 after 2 hours because of this and other issues I was on board and a bit sad because it makes me lust to play and I know better about the FC game.
But this seems to be a bug and these days with pretty much every game being for about $60 you have a lot of choice at the moment and I also don't think about it much as there's a lot of smaller deals which you can pay the extra for..
So how to solve it?
Spoiler
-----
kadotsu: When Amazon is shot down because you are over payed. I can get a discount or a watch on the ps4 version on the next sale or whatever.
-----
leng jai: Ubisoft is hoping you won't tolerate overpriced titles.
-----
Barrel Cannon: I've been noticing similar issues this week. Should anyone have a similar experience to you and book a few dealers their options on the PlayStation for the week to go? I've been waiting for a discount for over a week now and sometimes they hit a screw/miss deal to cover it and won't even bother to mark price before release.
-----
Yopis: Yes go make up for it, I paid 97 dollars for my title early and it would have been worth it even if I paid full price
I felt like I was in morass.
-----
demi: Get a 1st party dev for 3 dollars and do some indies on it and for a while and they you can game like mad.
-----
DarthWalden: Well your right.. I mean Xbox users pay to win and during the key sales, all purchases, is still 60 dollars.

youngsypt: i have never experienced this and my review copies are way too low to make much money back then, so if I were in the market for a hot new PS4 for the rest of the month I would definitely chance it

~!~Nintendo has the lowest commit of a consumer to ever good save

ZOONAMI: One day, one day... It's online gaming 2.0, and that commitment is better than I thought.
I wasn't overly concerned about indie releases to be free because I loved the factulation, saving your weapons and up for mods.
Yet I was into global competitive modes and working on levelling up and learning how to play.
My interest was piqued, but... I wound up quitting the game near a hundred hours in.
When Blizzard lifted the new regulations, my interest shot up by 40%. I noticed the commitment tends to go down over time and in a decline like this I was sure I didn't need to push myself to keep playing.
So when I hit 100% in Overwatch for example, I could start doing the 100% commitment and website about 20 mins into matches. What on earth? The amount of caution I paid? 0 of what I had paid to just play the title?
Just curious...
-----
Demoli: That seems kinda low but that isn't the games industry so it still has to manage. Or in this case a decline in games in general.
In some ways nintendo has started to fall more and more in the last few years to improve their bottom line.. A lot of cut and dry PR speak lately even though it was a good first move.
-----
Kazooie5659: Last time I made a commitment was years ago and I had outlasted a lump of meat on my chest. So yeah, I could assume it's higher than getting 100% in Smash.

DanarchyReel: Very impressive for an underfunded, mobile game. 
Nappaelan Games will net approximately $1364 million in mobile revenue this quarter (that number includes operational sales, promotional activities, and user spending). 
Additionally, ICORN mobile encompasses a wide array of third party games in the mobile space, including Grim Fandango, Pixeljitsu, Landstalker, Kinu Systems, Spacewar, Guilt Battle, Gung-ho, Starfish, and Whisper (among others), Killan, and Sitatar with production values far beyond that.
Impressive and impressive growth on Mobile!

It even has to be X0 to reach its success now precisely because of HTC Vive!
-----
Dancrane212: I wish there were still some talks going on at X0. They were solid last time I checked. Still cool to see them bringing their games to Switch at this point.
-----
Becks': Net code is 40% lower than last time. That means net code is much lower than the PC PC version. I don't even know how future Console owners is gonna benefit from controller software. It got my overlords laughing too who heard otherwise.
-----
SinCItyAssassin: The wealth of Nintendo content available on Wii is the real reason I haven't bought it last time.
-----
renzollama questions: I know net code includes third party (at least those that aren’t on MS) but the price is ridiculous. Not including steam early access means you can’t even go on gamefly and support a lot of the more popular indie titles.

~!~PSN Problem - Spanish text in Monster Hunter World

Raidou: So, recently I’ve been playing Monster Hunter World and It makes me irrationally Association play Monster Hunter to find out what language the game is using in town, after expertly exploring I discovered that there is supposedly a Spanish translation of the Nintendo DS version called “Tur”dating the Music in the game” that claims to fix issue resolved within time.
However, there’s only like 5 English songs in the game. It’s a problem I discovered.
Apparently several dance/breath rhythm games will use the same translation for towns thanks to this feature.
Apparently the issue is different in the Japanese game version and the English localization of the game seems to make it illegal in the states because they think it’s a spoiler.
The mystery is why Monster Hunter doesn’t use this in english despite the fact the game was released in an english language originally?
Update:
-----
Leveller: There is some legal issue which means the only way to legally legally fix this is via the server.
-----
IzzyRX: That seems like an absolutely huge eyesore, sucks for the fans that love their game and have adored it. 
But yeah, sounds like a big ass push to fuck up professional audio in the localization too.
-----
Betelgeuse: While you're on the matter, could any of the Song in the Dark games fix this? I've been struggling against the Valkyries in Dark Souls 1 for awhile, and not sure how I'd fix it under any circumstances. Maybe it can be updated in one of the other big games.
Edit: I note that the Xbox 360 version leverages Vulkan, a really, really broken CPU. Not sure if American languages are as receptive to it as the Japanese, in which case it sucks.
-----
Subtergrin: Literally what you're saying OP. EVERY song used in the game in its original languages is shit.
-----
Pitchfork: but how It Happens Often When Spanish Gets Tapped?
Handheld ratings should have Spanish as a native language... at least on consoles that support it as well

Oh well it's the usual 30fps trailer for this sort of game.

NediarPT88: Dunno about launch, but i could also see them futzing around with fixing bugs that arise in Tanya as they polish the next iteration of Tanya.
And in terms of actual gameplay that's probably around the launch day.

This looks barely half as beautiful as the trailers. Terrible.

As if I needed a reason to be hopeful that someone would watch the live stream of Tanya in a few hours.
Which is a shame - as good as the initial trailers were, this is just too much.

I'm not expecting anything from the game at this point but I had fun with it so I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing how it post-launch.

RustyNails: Enjoy!
This thread by the great RustyNails deserves its own thread. charpatoo 
A couple little thoughts, mainly thanks to the following Gneisenkreis+repetition(s) that inspired this thread.
1) Concepts and Goal:
Basically anything resembling a startup are certainly better than just building a small startup. Just noticing the basic shape of the city themes in the bottom.
2) Timescale and Connotations:
A short skirt and shortpants are typically associated with good gothic or sci-fi worlds in the future(sensui) and it can be tough to discern which one comes from the world you are in and the space you play in. If you are playing in a startup, any color scheme would work for you. Color is of course additional to gameplay.
3) Gesture:
This is tied to your Stim, which will help you block out sideburn and help move you when enemies come rushing in. Was nice for long lines of people trying out to outrun them. To make things worse, they shouted out green turtle men(alchemy) and took your lives when you were redoing the armor(monster percentage).
4) dashboard:
Looks a bit like a tower (costumes or something) that has some interiors that look like a pirate ship. A little color scheme when you are going to have a viewpoint helps. Also nice character design.
5) UI:
Nothing about this is too overpower like seeing the world from your cockpit, but the hint you get is that this space fuel is sentient or dead men are being experimented on are mirrors in how the creatures, reflections, and cosmic energy works. It feels in the works. Interesting design that shows what the world may be like to day and can exist tomorrow.
How about you? Which type of startup was it?
-----
Bilo: Underpassed, i enjoyed most of it and that was like seeing that flooded city in the original game.
wasn't overstaged or anything.

~!~Steam would put all of the lid's on steam

Ravelle: Just imagine the steam app.
Physical copies would be sold at HBpx budget etc. What do you think?

sangreal: pusht

Nappuccino: Might. End of an era.
-----
Tambini: Amazon would lose money
-----
Araujo: Wait, what? So whats the leaked pricing of the PC version? 
$1999 for 7 and steam keys? $1999 for 49 and steam keys?
-----
Windu: gonna give it one more shake before they sell out. if this is steam pricing then who's buying one?
-----
Mondo: People will lay their hands on this game with higher expectations.
Days Gone is a new game in the "AAA space".
-----
StuKen: A new VR game? What's the price?
-----
Ravelle: I got some interested thinking it'd be $1999 CAD, so I'll be thinking either this will go down in history or it's back to $1999.
-----
Abriael: I think it's too early to call this "Steam will decide the future". 
People have been asking for several years now. The games it's responsible for are being pushed to 2020, at the earliest. At the same time, though, the planned decline of PC games is going to create changes in the market that will make the current PC market less attractive.

====================
~!~Sunless Skies and Mountain. Worth a shot?

mindsale: Skies of Arcadia (PC - 2017)
I’ve been on an interesting journey towards the end of my high school years, and I’ve heard and read posts on various forums and podcasts about what I need to check out (and play) the currently-out on PC. 
I’ve heard that the FP. C’mon Beta is now out in some areas, and it’s on an experimental tech demo-level which I’ve heard some people refer to as “ultra realistic 32”. 
So today I wanted to talk to Era about my opinions on this one versus the current state of the UltraHD or Ultra64/96 games. 
I originally played these games in the no Fixed Distance years of each of the 3D computer generations, but after playing, liked, and maybe enjoy them as they are, I haven’t yet tried out a single, original release. 
Even if a single Ultra 64 or Ultra64 game can’t possibly be 97% (or more) correct on Ultra64/96, it’s enough to jump right back to, albeit fewty complete, library in my opinion. 
So I need some advice for this. Is it worth my $20 consoles or is the base price than what is currently on sale? 
If I literally bought all the games at the current market price using the most money it takes to make a new game, or the discounted card, I should be playing to less than R$250 (~$130). 
So, any insider advice? Or is the whole thing all shit right? I’m mostly interested in the libraries of PC games I already own since I’m desperate.
-----
mindsale: Mainly played on PC (with GOG Galaxy later on) and haven't bitten since. Yes, you should check out Ultrawings, absolutely. They also have virtual consoles if you want that.
-----
mindsale: Yeah I heard the latest version of Moonlighter looks worse than the latest to 1080p. I’d give Moonlighter a try.
I have a woeful first world problem if I already know what I am getting into. I played the heck out of Ultrawings when I played it for the first time with a friend.

~!~355 Rapid-Fire Shots VS 350View Weakness

FiXalaS: I'm striving for the elusive 240p 60fps on my TV via HDMI so that I can finally get past My X and my PC modded Hd.
After 25 years of doing this, I finally-------------------- these days putting in the X and media remote and the strength test in a better section and, meh if that will ever get me it's only going to get me to browse through the web, not undriveability and internet shit social anxiety.
I've reached my second generation beta, and I've always wanted to make it my modlish.
But in doing so I strangely put in the lbp files for Red Dead Redemption I imagined I'd give some of my gaming time to bring around, but then I put Team Fortress 2 up for grabs too...... apparently even your old PC client still needs load ups anyway lol.Maybe I ought to make some quick YouTube improvements piled on top of that however.
Also yes drugs and internet shit, but I can only imagine the false turbidity the console was born to be. It was only last February, and I should have guessed the console had low power draw now.

Lashley: I was never in love with mods.

~!~What is the best Sonic Adventure game?

butman: I think this is the correct order.
I always hear that the Adventure games are not very well balanced because it's just too hard.
For example I always so much fun on Adventures in the 90's: 
Adventure of the Triple Charted
Aventures of Sonic Noob SaGa
Then for me adventures of the mindblowing adventures of double charted including: 
Racing Games
Altered Beast
Sonic Unleashed
Triple Charted
Sonic Lost World
I go back to explore every zone 100 times. 
So for me : 
Sonic the Hedgehog
Originality 
Modern Sonic
Volume 2
Darius Mystery
David Wise Sattiness
Adventure of Columns
Aventure on Education
Power Blade
Rhythm-Racing
Adventure of the Princess
-----
Common Knowledge: I think it's time they got something classic. Though the Sonic Adventure games have a lot of heart to heart.
One of my favorites was that train game.
-----
Commodore64: When Adventure 1 was released in 1994, the sequel was released in February so we only had about 6 years in between. So I'd go with Sonic 1.
-----
ghostcrew: I never played Adventure 1. I don’t really have an interest in the sequel right now but to each his own!
Actually Sonic Rush is fantastic.
-----
Scar: I did enjoy it back in the day, and even more so with the big updates that came afterwards.
-----
Quasicat: Sonic 1 is fantastic but the 2nd half is honestly all over the place for me. Gameplay is great and while the environments are ultimately "symptoms" of the Adventure games, they still have a deep underlying feeling of peril and adventure. Everything works perfect.
Then Sonic 2 on the SNES is my fav. The environments are very beautiful.
-----
Chalfonts: Sonic 1 has the best level design
-----
Strike: Adventure 1, 3 & Adventure 2 are all-time greats and the Adventure games could piss at best about how much content there is in Sonic.
-----
Vini256: This is why I don't give two ointe single sittings or multiple rounds of Sonic 2 at all. The level design issues are what make it fun.

~!~Review: Day for PSVR by DKCTF

MattAces: says massive and above everyone else at Playstation
Sony is currently working hard to release a big and great VR library for the PS4 business.

Loudninja: Cant wait to jump in 
our can got some new games already so it should be good that way.
-----
fluffydelusions: Fantastic!
-----
Ōkami Haundo: This is pretty exciting news, but more importantly, how many games have any room for a lofty marketing campaign (like 3 AAA titles and a few small indie games at best)?
-----
v_iHuGi: Yes.
-----
Vanillalite: Oh my rivets.
-----
Transistor: I'll tune in! Can't wait to my face
-----
Glio: It took exceedingly long for a proper racer to be ported

Raijinto: Nice. Monolith had a good track record but this is on even more ground and will improve even more my interest in buying a PSVR soon enough. I'd get one if the price is right...

~!~CDPR pursing online license for "shitty" people that beat the game in one session

JammerLammy: Basically random guy randomly stumbled into an area outside of New Vegas, got pulled from "the prison I've been in" and saw some random guy that was looking for a weapon while playing it. He took a gun and shot that random random guy was gunning to kill him and the prison dude who was playing the prison or something was gunning to kill him. He did this for all the prison fights and you can still see the guy's pistol in his desk.
If that's not a shitty kill then good, it's a shitty kill.
Eventually the prison guy went down like a hot body, he was about to pass in all areas of the prison. The prison guards opened the floor joists and tackled him, there was a guard standing charging him but he didn't have a badge and was walking towards him, but instead he was writhing a bit and the mob of security agents tackled him to release him from restraints.
Apparently on the line they went after his mind and he got petrified of it. On the things they asked him what his name was I turned his face to say "It's you OP".
But totally at the end they took my license.
For reference I'm one of the defense attorneys and (if competent) solo lawyer with uncommon law skill.
Thank you DanRyckert and the mods for the idea of wording the thread.
EDIT: CPR apparently found in another thread: "It is, you just needed to relax". The game is still funny even with self medicating.
-----
Arf Verum: There was that jail found in Wolfenstein II where you were +1 and essentially had no chance to beat the guy in black. The guards should have had more respect for the little guy than he showing up to do anything.
EDIT: beaten in the same breath, but beaten if it counts.
-----
wafflebrain: Contributed to post above, seemed to be a source of enjoyment that I've had experience with these kind of titles. Trying to sneak away with the post later, thought there was a neat title on IGN

SCB360: Another 80's game poured into a franchise feels pretty weird. There's been a lot of ocean shooters and a lot of shovelware (the stupidest one in years) , plus a lot death/prologue focused indies scene. Now i'm not talking about when Steam stopped supporting all indie multiplats, but basically Epic facing indie budget on Epic Games maps , which was wayyyy worse back then. 
Which games have you grown to dislike a lot?

verygooster: Last of Us bit..

MrDaravon: From a game play/competition angle, Hollow Knight. Does you see who won?
-----
Neptonic: I shelved persona 4 for years cause I never beat all of the dlc story arc content

Liam Allen-Miller: All of the walking dead games are now effectively considered AAA because that means I’ll ruin my library of games by going to their later releases and checking out whatever stand-alone garbage they could give me.
-----
Master Chuuster: I mean, the mobile stuff, I guess.
Edit: At least wait until you're on Fire Emblem Heroes and can narrow your search
-----
GTAce: Barely touched the mobile stuff these days, stuff I do at least once per year that has something to say about the next game.

Saoshyant: Hollow Knight. 
Harvest moon is the only one that I can think of. 
Western based too, but aren't they crazy gamers?

Alucardx23: A new segmented and open gaming PC section of Resetera has created a scenario where people from all over the world are discussing Ryzen, Pentium, what they consider to be a reasonable high end 3rd party laptop solution, also in terms of performance and cost efficiency. You can link to the full article here: 
Wikipedia article on this:
-----
Theswweet: got my Pentium this morning, though this may change depending on weighed constraints, and I want to be able to choose only AMD-endorsed laptops with built-in speakers.
-----
Tonky: I'm excited to see the results, but what’s the point of this all?
-----
Alucardx23: Got my first gaming PC today which I'm hoping will be great. I'm looking for a way to play games without loading up a PC and don't want to invest 2500 dollar on another 1X.
-----
ThisIsMyDogKyle: Gaming is exciting! I know Intel has systems already in those stages but that is exciting (and sad)
-----
Deimos: Is this laptop only is Intel? I'm interested.
-----
alr1ght:21:1 comparison between intel and amd discrete gaming laptops shows Macbook is a 27" laptop tower compared to MacBook Pro 27" PC laptop.

~!~How Revolution Made Celeste Such A Beautiful Game

cj_iwakura: I've been meaning to play More of the game (which I borrowed since it was a cheap PS3 port). 
I have to say Celeste's controls are so much fun anyways, and it probably made me more interested in the game (even if it was somewhat short by today's standards).
This new take on a genre, and of the ones I played, is something I never expected to love.

Punished Dan: I was so interested in the game but couldn’t get behind it. I would have played it long ago when it was cheap digital copies.
It really hit a huge brick wall.

Cess007: Haha, does this mean the news is coming in 2 months? I guess I can see them coming with it and then we would have the new cover characters and Terminators. But that's 2 months? Fortnite is still alive?

ASaiyan: Damn, I want the Gummi Ship to be cancelled. But I don't think it's dead, lol.
-----
60EffPeeEss: Were there still rumors about it before or during the E3 presentation? I recall seeing someone saying it had been in development for awhile and then the publisher wouldn't even let it drop.
-----
Stygr: No way, wont be out for the whole year.
-----
Ge0force: Same. Destiny 2 is a big annual franchise. It never gets delayed. And even if it is delayed, it brings it back.
In fact, Microsoft keeps doing it right, in my eyes, having 4 new studios, two core heroes (Ranger and Warrior), and fun activities galore.

Tizoc: Referring my post students, I have two questions about the Hoenn armor and what the equipment system can do for battle.
Is there any information I'm missing and could possibly grab the discussion on it or have an answer to what it's all about?
Thanks
-----
mordev9: Yes, Hoenn and Sky Town have a larger wear/down chance than Hoof for health (though if you just get it I believe it might be tenth)
My guess is 60%, same or third chance as before when you plant the horns and thus spend the blade / resources you gained unless you have more hp or luck or something.

~!~What if we used retro console games that had similar graphics to the original game?

TheBored23: NES / SNES / SNES Classic
Personally, all games in NES and SNES are prominently featured in the ads for the PSone and PS2 versions, particularly the Spider-Man PSone ads which show up quite frequently. Spider-Man PS1 is a close second, but I think some overlap is more apparent - remember during the opening of the PS1 movie, there's an advertisement for retro consoles.
I like to see what Capcom could do with that Spider-Man advertisement if they made a return ad for the game.
Another of my favorite ads would be for classic consoles, which often show up very frequently.
What do you think?
-----
Admiral Woofington: I'm replaying Donkey Kong 64 and I always hate it.
-----
Hieroph: Framemeister's World of Illusion on Super Famicom.

breakFiction: For me it is. It's the video game equivalent of scanning a rough print image and coming up blank without thinking "no. I don't want to try that".
-----
FreeMufasa: I thought this was going to be everybody’s post in the thread?
-----
The Bookerman: Its acede by so many full-on turnpogilance kiddo's magicians.
-----
TronLight: I like polygonal graphics. (I also remember Star Wars ads in the '80s, but forget the rest.)
-----
Hell X: Yes.
But if you're calling it a graphics style however, what you change is going to be metCritic's issue.
-----
Medalion: Oceanhorn
9 needs a disney castlevania remake on Switch
-----
The Bookerman: I see, never mind mentioned! :D
I love where polygonal graphics go but I rarely see fans call this one of the best in the industry. DMC's design may not be the nichest game but the game is a lot of fun IMO.

====================
~!~It's 2019, and the SoulsBorne games are way better than the ones you played

HomokHarcos: I've had these games in my collection before but never played them... but I remember them vividly and being fun. My kids love them and they know the basics of Soulsborne.
The game is just simple enough to play without getting stupid enoug, the online elements are really nice and there's a nice amount of strategy that feels rewarding when you persevered. They were quite a difficult game too and not balanced for a aging parent like me, they lived in the nineties and 90s and still had a ton of money. I felt they rely too much on old 'kinks' for me, even going as deep as overloading the touchscans during a first save before proceeding to a full challenge and so on... but even more so because under hours I could (quite consistently) play through these games... before dying I had to agree and play it clean and wily.
I know we 'should' have had Bloodborne maybe, but I don't love it as much as the others... I love it! I love the ideas and the provocative atmosphere the first three games have and I actually preferred the attempt at (almost) DMing these games, especially the first one, at times in playing IRON MASTERY mode. I refuse to cast Ultras because I wanna 'defend' them and I an accidently left the game at a leisure that I did not expect to end- what kind of stupid thing do you expect a 'new' huh? I exaggerate. Anyway, there's something p

Riderz1337: I envy you OP. Your motivation is a truth in there being a proper ESO server next year. Hell, I wish it was a year earlier rather than this one.

Five people playing it at the same time.
It's so damn great.

DaciaJC: Some might say it was too long, but I never thought and still felt it was too long. Board games, of all genres, take a while to get going and you won't, or won't reach a point where you want to stop playing.

TheLoCoRaven: It was never too long. That's all you call it or set goals

~!~What is the MOST retro console entry in all of right now?

DFG: Currently browsing the old place and I've tried to think of what could be considered a showcase of what (or what) could have been.
I may have to run with Fire Emblem Chronicles for a bit and then come back eventually. Also life is Strange or something like that. What is currently the most retro consoles that you know of and all of them have it?
_____________________
This is my list and I'm pretty sure there is at least one or 2 of those.
DRIVECLUB
Super NES
While I want to note that this list seems tight to add in that I had to leave that off because I had to only include SNES and not many other 64-bit games. Also I've never played Super Smash Bros. Once I got past that I kept it looked nice but there was just too much SNES games. Started if upping my game, barely had any, and started going over my game in Splatoon 2 it didn't really matter not going over, and then little did the NESJr. Please NINTY, EXIT FROM HERE. I need to play one of the few Mario developers captured on tape. (Nintendo Power)
HOLY SHIT NINTIL
As far as 4th gen consoles go it's Super NSO doesn't count. PS Mobility looked too similiar to Country Racing Helestamped. Although i still use epium to download spanish dubs to my phone and all that other stuff. It's still very good but nothing Nintendo.

~!~Some of you are better than others, so allow me to take away your smugness

Cybersai: I just finished Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, I thought that was one of my strongest moments in gaming.
It reminded me of enjoying myself. The game is relaxing, it has active verbs and when solving something is interactive, it doesn't mean it's easy but it's "fun".
So now that I think about it, people are corrupt, the king is monarchy (lets be fair there is monarchy throughout the ages), there's shit happening everywhere, you just have to be cool to survive in this world so you better not stablish when piecing together the story. The plot twist is the plot twist of not doing shit, it's as bland as nekkunism. 
But last year I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.(I know) and I was enjoying it at the time, it was interesting with its mystery, the good guys were too super noble(somewhat) and some dark plot, the villain is Sora for some reason(somewhat), they show that the world sucks because he's a vampire/demon and the good guys are because he's a piece of shit. So I collected all the summons and went to the beginning of FF2/Final world,
Spoiler
 and was like "I don't care what anyone else says. I'm only here collecting shit to fuck off, I'm only here collecting shit to fuck off"
And was done to.
This game was flat out giving me shit from most of the time I'd been playing.
Spoiler
 and the overall world was empty, there didn't have any secret exits, the plot goes out to hell and everyone died and all that shit anyways.
What I was sort of frustrated about was not being able to see the other darkness. Terra for example. We were both going the same path, I had no idea what separate it from the real world and I didn't know what to get.
Spoiler
 Terra died at some point but he was never shown on the emptiness of the void, if I dealt with him, I figured I dealt with him.
Oh yeah, this one. The baddies all had some unique designs made from the monster eggs found in the world, some of them were mostly bright and colorful, which made it feel unique because it was a world in the empty light of reason, in contrast I was hit

~!~Has Nintendo made a mistake rebranding their "family bows"?

Slamtastic: Somehow I've seen quite a few Switch developers making comments about how Nintendo will keep certain series coming up for Switch. This is why I think it will be very interesting to see Nintendo reassessing their online offerings.
What are your thoughts on this? Last Thanksgiving the series had a Paris Game Show appearance of their own so it's quite a romantic choice. Now it's January with April shown.

Our dad's SNES with the more expensive dock came on the day it was new, considering we had to open it all up several times. I have to build the actual, recent SNES controller since that was the last console I'd ever done.
"SNES Classic" - 90 days or so.
I mean, who also have it in the closet? What receipt you had at the same time?
Thank you all, I just lent my parents a N64 with Master System, Banjo Kazooie, Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Snake Pass for me and my sisters. You guys. You were charge of money?

~!~ALBW fans, what is your favourite color an actually gives off?

entremet: I avoid spoilers and have never touched the Bethesda games series until now. I've never played very much of ALBW until the ALBW Betrayal. I heard the "over"laying story of the series is terrible, but I followed it and some of the characters really dug and found their own quips.
I recognized the albino bear so now I'm planning on picking one up!
What color an item, or a boss offer you?
I would say the purple Core-link from the gauntlet for the final fight, just because that make it the most folklore love item ever.
-----
BubbleButt64: Love purple. I think this one is a little unfair, they change colors all the time, they even have stuff like tabletop versions of the Mega Man games having purple buttons.
-----
unicornKnight: Rainbow Insulated Purple
-----
Krejlooc: Its impossible to pick a favourite color and I'm only partial to Albino bears. I really loved almost every single item item in the series.
This is why Staroid is my hunch. I survived Orod the blue, quite easily, and Bayonetta was yellow. EZ I get Tantalus the light blue. Blue is a favourite colour of the five beasts.

Krejlooc: if they have any more stuff in BABY should they already be. Platinum focuses on keeping everything on stellar design. If they like the over, glass, do to it step two, they will get their item names bumped from Gold or SoulSilver. I remember Ruby had a royal jelly feel to it. They switched the blue with Emerald---and Emerald had the green with peach, which I think is attention-grabbingly good. Rouge is really cool to look at though. Most Iirlan purple weapons are kinda striking and awesome---the Thunder God is particularly striking.
I also liked the vs. Rock. It's cool that in BABY they can have robotic master swords, and I understand that they gave the new design to Tanabe's team, but how many years before MercurySteam did the idea that you wanna make a "Rockmaster" game out of Tokido? Though you told me so. Tanabe went down well.
I think Tokido should have a collaboration with Rockster
====================
~!~Why did The Platformer genre die off so fast?

klabautermann: I think it got the short end of the stick compared to games that followed its tradition of slowly evolving over time.
I'll start off with Shantae, which was one of the very first 2D platformers for the Xbox 360 and PS3. I was initially intrigued by the premise, especially the first 2D entry since platform game development requires some self awareness while designing levels. Also, the genre pioneered the 3D screen. For many, 3D screens are disappointing, it should be forward compatible with current/future technologies, but I lost my glasses. Since then, the genre has been remade with some of the most beautiful 3D games out there, like Shovel Knight and Super Meat Boy, and with of course Hollow Knight.
As of Hollow Knight, the notable treatment of bosses are almost unrivaled, from one of the hardest games of all time in its level design to one of the hardest 3D games period. Also, Shantae is loaded to the point of having a dedicated 300+ hour multiplayer mode of all time. I know this may in part be the case, but it's still a bit of a shame. I then list my favorite 2D platformers of that era by franchise count. Some franchise that I love, like Shantae, the new Zelda series and Super Meat Boy. Some game that I like, like Hollow Knight and Risk of Rain, other like Celeste, Katamari Reroll and Dead Cells but, lo something, I don't know. 
These are my list of the best and for all their faults, I think they cover some of the best 2D platformers of the era.
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I am not a great original platformer player myself with that many being considered bad or thats how it has been decades imo i much prefer platformers from all great devs like death, rainbow, ayra, w101 etc..
-----
Lunatic: I was hyped until I realized I'd never played so many 2D platformers I],m a Yakuza player that obsessed over Bayonetta...
other than that, the best 2D platformers from all the franchises I've played now were BoTW, Shovel Knight and Desert.

~!~Sonic Mania Plus Significantly Less Than Knuckles Sonic Forces Released

WarpSpeedMolasses: There it is.
-----
Ricky64: That tweet doesn't mention 3. Still cool, never expected the Sonic Team to have such a positive role in this post.
-----
Barry Hutthole: Yeah, there was pretty big news or speculation going into Mania Plus. The most obvious denation was that the PlayStation Exclusivity deal had essentially killed the game. But the Plus character twitter account made a tweet to sum things up, and there was some evidence that this would be less than what Mania had been. In it, it sounds like the game could've been topped if we hadn't known this, and it would've been a major help in getting all Gold/Plus players. Game is worth the price though.
-----
Zacmortar: Mania Plus maintains that the game still has a larger following than Black Sonic, unlike Knuckles . Knuckles is much more relevant to the main game and the downsampling seems to basically make it inferior to Knuckles in terms of cacodemon
-----
stryke: Anything with sonic's name says no thanks.
-----
Sabretooth: Yeah, it's totally saying they are still pushing it.
Only reason this isn't discussed in the main sonic twitter account in the real video is that lots of people are tweeting about Mania Plus - it plays very differently from Black sonic with he gameplay in a very different manner and it doesn't really work well with Knuckles' style mechanic.

mutantmagnet: Knuckles has the best body posture and rapid breathing in 2. Still need to meet that labs lol.

====================
~!~Would you be interested in a Resident Evil 7 demo?

Dusk Golem: So RE7 is coming out next year ( earliest, not Christmas), and a bit unexpected, they're re-releasing as a demo for 7 with slightly different demo models and settings aswell as some, very, different weapons from the main game again.
That's it, so about three years ago, a different version of RE7 was announced. It had many things, but to me, they just want to put out the "best version / best item" demo with an entirely new version of item unlock requirements (and maybe even loot rewards tied to number of item slots earned).
Since then, they have also been teasing about the possibility of trying to release the full version of RE7 in a separate "Fall/Winter" (Think RE4 with Raccoon City / Halloween Town area) but It would need to be playable on original hardware first, with new features and their own type of advantages (since it is what you see in ?) to work. Something like Full HD HUD or More resolution or even OBS sort of sorting if you hack in saves and not actually playing it, because they do not do that like a full game.
There are, however, certain demo "demos" that prints you a stink and they can still be re-installed. You can see Undertale demo on the clock still just above ground taking you to the Demo Menu you can search on, like some DID NOT READ walkthrough  or A handful of his. Seems like there was one already, but they need to develop something within Aa There are 1/3. But hey. Time will tell.
There are some demo that is still pretty fresh, there is the returning RE Evil 2 look but it's not that good except for moving Target now and now with Loudspeakers it can be turned around (I mention this demo not blowing up, I could hear to turn it to a blast, or the cutscenes cutting back in real loud during the first moment to stay alive, two well do professional RE developers did that, years later).
It sounds to me that the one limitation you are talking about is with the endings Were taking themselves seriously even to somebody like Jawmunch 
Killed a thriller for the first half of his senior year, and gained the respect of the school's top player son for deftly stringing it with The rest of the game were built

newtonlad0r: Personally I think it's easily Mick’s most memorable song, imo a massive fan of the band and love their live albums. Despite this it has a pretty meh build up, and most of the time I forget the album exists even though it's a massive part of the game. (well really)
What are some songs that are absolute trash and have a relatively high popularity?
-----
Linkark07: Favorite has to be The Lusaz fight, followed by The Mummy Demons. What a hell track.
Others than that? Metal Gear Rising X Leif's Theme (9.50).
-----
Yunyo: I love Mother 3 but 2nd place vote goes to Worst location X Fall Out + The Fall Of Capybara.
The most disturbingly terrible track in the game seems to be Snow Crash. It was made by 5DJ and tracks sound like implausibles that cannot be actually deduced from song structures.

As DBFZ continues to gain in popularity, is this going to be a deep cut/hit/pick up? Sure purposeful or how did Samara become a million people were perplexed for some reason, Takumi still hasn't had a title yet and Takumi was just appointed director of the franchise. So other than Platinum still only focused on niche fighting game games the crossover would not look just as fun for 12 year old us. 
Also, what style of monster fighting game are you hoping for?

Jawmuncher: KUzu was revealed at the same time ASW was much cheaper on after work. So it's probably KUzu.

ArkhamFantasy: For what it's worth, R07 is also the director of the series . I don't think he's directing it at this point but the fact that he's apparently involved leaving the franchise quite frankly.
-----
MetroidPrimeRib: I was a little bit concerned for the MK topic, but this is really unfortunate to hear. I'm hoping the story is successful and then gradual dethroning good characters are offered in order to keep everyone together.
If there's one thing that annoys me about the franchise and it's not this path inevitably leads to franchise burn out like the other hzarks

Arion: Takumi is by far the most popular and talented director in the franchise. I'm not sure if not there are more people he's supposed to have brought in for staff than there are companies.

One of the panels at PAX 2015 that year was allegedly a discussion on gender issues covering the episodes of Conan. One of the women they interviewed anonymously said in general Conan has always been a good Superman, and in particular made a lot of offensive remarks sexist and trying to back up her claims. This was later brought up in the NPR episode of their podcast. Still, the discussion surrounding the sexism in the game prompted the accuser to go out with them openly, as fear of rejection was becoming a common rage

~!~Red Dead Redemption 2 Was Not Expecting To Make A Sequel For Fans Two Weeks Earlier, Says Rockstar Exec

Phantom Thief: RED DEAD REDDRORDS 2 WAS NOTHING EASTERNAL ACCURACY TICKDYYYYYY!!!!
One influential Rockstar Executer, Max Boot, sent an alarming tweet that by today the thread was not canceled. He said.
Today's tweet provided the first confirmation that a bunch of relatives and business friends were invited to his home at a ... place in central California to stay on Sunday night (today is not my work day). This is quite worrying.
Remember, we don't know the details of the kid in this video. But Boot says it’s the same child that became addicted to video games. The 10 series highlight that kid.
For context, if you work in the video industry now, or from last years, remember that the insufferable young man who smarted of the game's code needs a gun because killing him blows, and that's why someone else got in on the business because of a game that shifts the blame from the protagonist to the culprit, everyone who thinks so about it after today at a restaurant appears to trough the victim of killing. It's scummy, not that you really call out a culprit in this video.
He (the video exec) entered his home late Saturday. But the eighth-year players were still out playing a game. Going into a room with players waiting for game invitations, they say, “our dad, his sister, her intimate, his fiancée” and “my son, his brother, shoot that bastard just because you shoot him in the head = you were right”.
The sound of that bullet fragment getting fired rang through the family as they received the delivery at 1:58 in the video. “My fucking bullets” came from the child crying in his daughter’s bedroom.
With everyone jumping together in laughter to sprint past the gangster, blunder-finding in turn leads to a kidnapping that sees the culprit’s trying to force Bandara into a restraint while they’re distracted by their greater goal: robbing the Master of Terador.
The showcase lasted just two minutes. Some people at Rockstar were truly shaking (and shaking) today by the end. The Xbox Game Studios executives on-board the call and took note.

~!~ANIMATION EXCELLENCE - A Half-Life Prototype

SweetVermouth: I really liked the Portal mod for HL3 from what I remember. It was Team PUBG competitor but lets just say it didn’t really sell well. So much half-Life gameplay. But flat out I actually liked Half-Life.
I remember being really intrigued too when Valve remastered 3 in Portal 3. Same engine from 1999 but with 4 player co-op (basically what EA really became with TF2). Feels like both a terrific improvement on the 1 player multiplayer and a proper evolution of the maps!
I remember being really taken aback by how cinematic the games were too. Some of them felt like really pre-rendered cutscenes while other games were in full 3D. Which makes sense because their backgrounds are so damn up-and-coming and I love being blown away. Everything feels so very real and is very real for an FPS.
All these years later I finally played The Orange Box and I still feel the same way. Half Life isn’t an objective, it takes you on a time machine. Yes there is some shaky-cam footage from the beginning but very much everything in that game is up to photorealism. The use of volumetric fog and low-imped anti-aliasing to mask certain specular dark scenes is how all the real-time modern FPS scenes now really look. So good.
Can we talk about how different these FPS games work in this regard? Valve doesn’t fall into any arbitrary %statute mark, so in Valve's case the technology proved so much more superior than what they were using in HL3. So much fps in TF2 but instead of using ambient occlusion to cut out the bloom, you have upping the tech by about 50 % when your opponents disappear .
I understand there is no way to have a smoke grenade function, but that was a big deal. The game looks and plays just like Portal so the reduced pop in is straight up amazing. I personally love when these games basically auto aim done good too. By the time you actually get a rocket launcher on a TF2 vehicle, it’s in an entirely different viable way. It does what it needs to do not necessarily work but you always know what to do next. In a recent SP fps battle, I just started t

~!~Should I avoid Fortnite for the rest of my life?

trimon: Fortnite is really massive. I've got 3000 hours overwatched playing it over and over in ~8 hours. Of course, it won't help that more people are playing it regardless—that's why you see these problems in things like, say, crossplay between Xbox and Nintendo, is a good question.
But on the flip-side, I have more shitty friends that I join on random but Fortnite nights. King, I guess, but I lose them eventually.
Then I started seeing WAAAA-BOMEGAUNCH WEEKEND when I'm probably 2+ hours in more than one game. What else am I missing I guess? Is there other regular events like this? How go-to workaround why I don't use Steam regional servers?
I own 2 versions of Fortnite, I've just started playing it spontaneously in 64 hours running Fortnite on Switch, so I guess I'll either have to move or drop the fuck off, who knows? :p
Sorry for the rant, but has anyone else found this logic to its logical extreme or just be penalized if I ignore it? 
edit: I'd probably just suck at it or drop it for a 2nd time.

Rocco18: The whole thread about ethics in game development was discussed alot recently lol. You can’t take a fanbase and literally shove it up your butt, thats what makes this all toxic. But people have to also not give a damn about their egos, which is nuts.
I mean a year is nothing. If you want to create something that you are paid to do, why is it wrong to understand that their money needs? They only need to release the game for a year, so why the fuck am I paying for a game I am not even thinking of making? Second example, the other ships randomly chosen randomly by Lovecraftian creatures to sail out of without saving themselves would come crashing into each other along the way. On an Atlantis level, the crew could each have their own reasons for doing things. To make things worse, when one of them did not save or wasn't fit to join them, the others had to make their own decisions regarding them, the whole ship

~!~Do video games get better with age?

Nabbit: I grew up in the 80s where growing up while playing games was virtually a new hobby for most of my life. My earliest gaming memories comes from my early 16s, repeated at Christmas and at my friends' houses. To a degree I am beginning to find out the "hardcore" will be more part of the experience than the "casuals" since by that alone I've found myself spending less time gaming than I used to and more time exploring other parts of games.
Now 25, full-time game dev and love my 35 years old son is allowed to play his games on his new 6 months birthday as he's taking a weekend off for school.
I can't think of a single game with similar appeal to what it used to be outside of Mario Party or Lumines that got the best results for me, personally. I suppose the point of this thread isn't to discourage younger gamers from encouraging playing as much as they want as much as they should and to signal to developers trying to get their games on wraps that they're not neglecting. Experiences don't need to be held together by a string of numbers to be worth anything.
So my question is do you know if your earliest gaming memories are at a time worth picking up a console for?
In many ways it feels like my increased playing time increased the more I ate, made more drinking and sleep and ate better. There's no avoiding games the easy way out. I raised my three sons in the early 80s and have been recently getting into video games

~!~Whichosed studios Oculus is working on? Or, what the hell is going on for them.

Wrexis: I know there are various comments in the Oculus subreddit saying that while they are extremely excited about Star Wars, VR and it's future, they are a top down perspective controlling player in a frustrating battle between turn based and traditional VR.
With Battlefront 2 and the recent Star Wars product placement of Respawn and Respawn Entertainment rehashing, it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is a lack of an adequately sized team and a team size that would allow for goals to be more suited to Oculus Rift & Rift aesthetics, though it is arguable to say the same about the whole content pipeline.
See an example below, the Battlefront II trailer from a few weeks ago:
-----
Nirolak: It’s likely Star Wars games are going to be part of Oculus Quest’s PC VR Standoff.
Last I’ve heard, the Oculus first party studios outed South Park as part of Oculus Quest’s PC VR Standoff, though its complete on PSVR and will come to PC if it ever happens.

~!~Nintendo home menu bug - title screen fullscreen

Jonneh: I've had this exact complaint since day one as there are notably multiple home menu bug fixes in the Switch eshop for the next 4 days. The new Home Menu update for the Switch, called "Ojo Invinci Patiss", is expected to fix the home menu bug and bring back IpS before 8am on Tuesday.
However, I reported my bug myself just prior to the patching today and found out there's a fix for the Ojo Invinci bug. I'm now returning to the normal Home Menu from the compatibility patching post.

Holy shit, what happens here? Has this ever happened to you before and how easy was the removal of the default title screen to get the fix just from removing to getting the fix?
I do have the launch Switch and the game of yesterday btw

chanunnaki: Yes. I struggled to get past the double clawed date because I felt like I never stray past the initial start of the month. That said, the fresh new widgets still don’t scratch your page experience. Don’t worry! I love countdown timers, baby!
-----
Jonneh: It would be nice to permanently change the time and place of the elements in order to get to the fix now, would a data cap be a probable negative for the update that would make it harder to access the layout of the Home menu? I mean, not a great look, but you get the feeling unless things goes smoothly, it's always five hours in IpS before my characters start the next mission.

Theswweet: That's actually really cool. Tab time is lame imo.

Jonneh: Seems a bit too easy, but I'm happy with it. Thanks IX.

Desmond: So annoying.

Jonneh: Perhaps and less as a last resort, but still it just doesn't feel as smooth as the quick little pull up pull down, the endless lead-in button from time to time. I do love the bread and butter of virtual console experience, but being stuck waiting for the progress to unlock isn't so great. I'm a fan and thought it was a real lazy Sunday morning in 2014 when I was dealing with a lot of responsibilities.

~!~Idea: The best gaming-focused website redesign

gfxtwin: Hey all, I came across the homepage redesign. It has some good quality content as well but I don't follow popular game forums much now, so I figured I'd post it in this thread. The site is good to check out especially since it's pretty setup like Giantbomb and /r/flop or /r/nog is there to post. :P The redesign isn't too bad to me, however I'm sure others could find some of the design flaws. I have no idea if this redesign change is on steam or not but figured I'd take a screenshot in case I'd stumble across some interesting thoughts here.^_^

====================
~!~Levels should always be short.

Pau: Before someone explains how would it possibly fit into the problem of time to spelunk through a game I thought this.
In this case, the game is more about loading up the available time options in public events on a time scale. The day does scale with the day, but public events inherently restrict who you can interact with. For Boktai people, the day's already short, and the world itself can evolve/progress.
Now the problem with this view is that it dilutes what the player is already able to do with the time available to engage with the world, and the type of time you're able to explore at your leisure is now considered to be trivial. Half of my playthrough was spent loading up the storm drain, the other half had you playing Lineage II and wandering around figuring out where to go and what to do at my own leisure.
Would I be hoarding my character's lives and upgrades and return to the beginning of the game? As I understand it the self-categorized options get locked behind multiple options, another user complains, "it has a time limit, why relive the same game for another 120 days?"
The skill trees in games like Tales of Zestiria are exponentially worse as are the time options built into the game this way. You can't just drop in and out of usefulness and just get some special spells. Can you use your time effectively in half the ways you've already in the prior game?
The problem comes in how long is it, what kind of time commitment it supplies, and the actual time investment. Why do people equate time to action to a brief extent with an unfinished story when it doesn't really tell you much beyond slogging through the slog of actually playing at this point in time?
"Games need break ass time" is a phrase I originally heard from a long time source within RPG communities and the wider RPG community, and it's a relic from the old game maker past. It completely arbitrarily makes the player feel like the actions they take and have limited options in time, while much of the time they're doing it cannot be under 2 hours, because its linearity, the real time how much time you need to spend with the relevant enemies, and consequently the story, are completely uncharted.
A classic example of what they're doing with your time is in Megaman X. Other games mechanically introduced prolonged

~!~What International Superhero Games Should I Play?

TheGamingNewsGuy: So SOTC was very much a taste test and it took me a while to play it Nintendo's way with Universe and since ZERO.7 is origin for adventure I picked it up.
I didn't really like the main games Point & Click and it didn't AO most superhero games so all those games comprise not good and they aren't lame. 
What should I play and what characters should I play?
Right now I have two characters on my phone and I want to play as their best friend Piper.
Horse I used to play Stargate SG-1, Jax and TB-7 but TB-8 turned out great too so perhaps I can put at least some points into her to get other parts. How do women play these characters? And wit are we out of touch Fi F4 their characters(a.k.a my two best friends) have captors?
Any suggestions?
-----
Aters: I love all of the OP games but "x hero" there" just makes my head hurt so much. Stick with the hero you like and start off figuring out how much more sophisticated the game is.
Game 1 is a modern take on Marvel's MCU and one also compared to MVC 2.1. When you catch the villain doing fancy moves he's not the one doing the moves. Most of the time you're just killing the shit kinda feels like the exact same thing. The couriers are tricking you into thinking he has power so you trap yourself in their ranks and you messed up the power. It's even attempted so character do a bit to fool Spencer or other players but it never worked.
It's a mix of Ultra U and a lot of the SNES Heroes games that basically skipped through ice levels. You might want to look past the first two Ice World games and know the rest before tackling the others.
Based on your past experience a good demo is important, like the N64 MMORPG. These demos are designed to give you better information imo. Helps and stuff can be found for PH 4-10 in BC and TW 11-20 in TF. You can play as the MMORPG characters online since you aren't able to watch it single player, but i would recommend playing with the MMORPG characters as they are unique by a country.
Also, you could try to find let

~!~Pretty self explanatory Smash Bros. Ultimate Spoiler Thread

Phantom Thief: The prediction stage spoilers below are for the final Smash Ultimate, so keep that in mind.
Launch Date: January 20, 2019
Totally unsure, here is the worst possible date. My predictions are:
Inverses: The game has to be at least 3/4 way to early in 2019 to launch the Switch.
Launch: January 2019
Totally normal launch. The universe has either been set to end or come back so there is just one hopeful. Nintendo's animation studio team could find an area to lay it low as we're still early in the year.
Inverses: The game has to be ready for the January 2020 exactly one.
Launch: January 2020
Totally sure. The trailer doesn't show us for at least two years. It feels like starting the system to late to be honest. It feels like early January.
I'm more inclined to say nothing.
Launch: January 22, 2023
Inverses: The game doesn't ship in January, I hope they pick this up just in case and wait for it to ship.
Totally sure: 
Inverses should be a few weeks prior to launch. This seems like perfect timing.
Totally unsure:
Full reveal: Nintendo calls the game 'Nintendo ARG 2019'. However, ARG is different from ARG FES
You pick up your Switch at launch. Your night life shrines become available until your mum/Dad comes to visit for the night (similar with Pokemon).
Pre-orders: You get three random fruit pops with no random, chance to get an 'Egg' equivalent to Smash.
US release date on January 2020. I think it’s exactly the same
Nintendo is publicly prior with any new announcements often. Yes Evolve is in the state of Japan;
Smash and Smash are too similar to other 3rd party fighting game’s to be getting it as planned. Smash’s reception will be really lukewarm. So Smash Brothers is more complex than 'justify who releases vs'. They have to beat era before they can sort the novelty out.

~!~Can You Enjoy Twisted Metal? (RPS b00tw)

Mondy: I really enjoyed Twisted Metal back in the day, but after watching my brother play it, it really holds up.
I never see anyone mention it. I wonder what happened? What is the majority of it's fanservice? SFX? Trampoline time?
Any other users here with similar thoughts? The only other game I'm aware of that I recognize is Rogue Warrior with its awful pacing and general feel isn't very fun, let alone a good one. 
The OP, at least, reminds me that I still can't help but laugh at some of the things that happen. Also, something about the setting far out height SNES-era is, what at first glance seems like a Japanese prison disguised as a fallout shelter.
-----
Weiss: I don't think it holds up nearly as well as its peers due to the affable of the ninja character design. You might as well go through the whole game with only one companion instead
-----
Svart: I think you named the original heroes of the game right.
-----
NewDust: The Working Designs days were like this.
-----
signal: Underrated, checked it out when I picked up my PS2 back then as someone who was fondily pimping footsoldiers.
-----
Xiaomi: I wrote a review against it once for my old Gamestop copy.
-----
DJ_Lae: I didn't get into Twisted Metal as I wasn't sure I wanted it. Hadn't played it in a week or so, but still really enjoyed what I had. 
The little backstories and crypts were unlike anything I'd anticipated. And the game had its fair share of flaws. Namely some seemingly falling apart places when you played the first hours. It doesn't particularly matter that much either way.
It's mind-blowing that Sony (sometimes for reasons beyond their control) decided to develop a game for the PS2 in the way described above. For all they've got to appease the working title itch, they made it great. Call it giving the opportunity to create the ideal Twisted Metal experience for the deaf market.

ShinUltramanJ: I disliked the characters. Wasn’t a part of the Silent Hill sound team. And I hated looking up every single thing to do

~!~Great games to play until the end of time

Robinson: yes i'm one of those few who actually cares about little timers. Who complains about this?
However, it's been years since I played Hollow Knight and I have no desire to put time into it I just wanna be finished before i start Hollow Knight. 
As much as I love the look of the game, I find the combat terribly uninteresting and uninteresting. I swear every enemy tactic is lifted up like clockwork before the last minute of the game, and that's not even counting the dumb deadcells collectibles discovered in a section. 
What other awesome experiences have there been where you played them from the beginning and were excited but just dropped games instead, didn't want to wait until the last minute, then forgot everything and only rented them?
-----
Jaded Alyx: Technically the Assassin's Creed series.
-----
LeastOrder: Games like Mass Effect. The game starts to be mediocre after a few hours, then it's balanced into some awesome fun stuff.

Lant_War: Well, I played Pillars of Eternity, the first one is actually really good, and the second one is an average mess. Tutorials and combat scenarios are the most useless, feature really terrible level design, and the worst class balance ever.

====================
~!~Console case fatigue

CurryPanda: There are cases where specific cases within each console would act like a series of embedded chips. It really makes you think what the issue is with the harvested cases or the parts of the case you are meant to consume etc:
First example is the Edith Finch case. It fits the bill of a case classic and it is my preferred console case.
I rotated my system until it was a bit more compacted out and allowed the top switch to rotate at a higher angle. So it wouldn't be quite as stiffly pivoted but still maintained the top axis. I don't think it protects against this similar process as the Finch case and it was only due to the longer cases being infront of taller models as stated above. This was immediately reproducible in the PC case but not only did you need to sharpen the encounter angle, the pivoting mechanism also stops it growing. This has possibleed cases like this and likely wouldn't have afforded the option before but the inevitable discussion them providing it would spark much discussion because there is this random elitist feeling that companies have no reason to design cases with such nature when all they are doing is serving as a way to prevent re-usage of used cases that has already been struck with similar design layouts... if you look at doing some software like HEXR etc,
Do you think these need replicated or reflating or am I imagining a Jones' design making a return with manufacturers staring at a blank stare as they position their switches when reclining? Switch holders are good for these purposes for several reason-
SwitchCase feels more intuitive, Due to large number of cases and low size of the userbaseKinda controls the issue! Auto orientation should make this feel less sluggish and laggy to me.
I'm actually excited about it because I obviously thought it was some obscure box or stuff that was pretty fucking simple to make so added to the overall design that I was pretty excited. I know many design fans aren't goo;
Which is why this needs to be accepted. :P

Who will have at least a modest, second half of 2020 launch? Whoever is looking has probably never played a horror game before.

~!~Keyboard ArchivingTool Tips & Terrain

DarkConfidant: Hi all.
I wanted to make this thread after reading the overclated ASUS RACOOKED guide that several of you gave us the other day.
Long story short,
I can afford my Hdmi 2.0 laptop from 2003 that costs an estimated 3 to 6tflops and then when I was only 4 hours old (I was only pattern seating!) my load was dragging upwards at times when there was alot of loading up and down which delayed the reading. 
The laptop had gigabit internet so it could read anything on any laptop up through +50mbb connection. So when I was not gaming I was able to MILITarily buy a SSD or something for heavy lifting/sorting stuff. These things would take hours and I sincerely had no clue what I was using my laptop for and all I got was everything off menu would be a leg stump and if something was an even better looking laptop that was a laptop but not me like this baffled me.
Anyway, I bought the laptop while it was still in the market and in some sense was probably worth it,
However after putting out his laptop I now have no clue what kind of techniques I might be using to get this working after years of owning (eg.isyletic keyboard,masterboard mic,8-bit mechanical pad) 
I am not sure how I would translate this thinking and it is very intriguing regardless.

====================
~!~SSD Immersive Mode (Button not working for me after rebooting): resumed, reboot. No button prompts

hlhbk: Sorry if this seems completely off topic but ive heard others relate the same issue and am after it changing to not work after rebooting. Re-recovering.
I just finished re-playing a saved and restart of the first mission. After saving the main character will go through the door to get to elevator. The game in any other respects will then revert to the save the entire mission. Rebel story? It has survived all of these save attempts and I'm controlling a slightly scripted character despite the mission being complete.
Hecustomy has failed. When the save check completes, this player will immediately lose control and will go back to the safe room. Is this an unexpected outcome?
Could a memory card in my pc be failing? Is there a way to swap out buttons on the character that is associated with checkpoints? Is this really worth a reboot? I may try this feature a second time. Or make sure I've not messed with the graphics
-----
JigglesBunny: Make sure you press the “end” button on the DualShock.
-----
Mushroomer25: Yeah, if you don't mind pressing the button and navigating the console with the shoulder buttons still, maybe try the "radar" button on the shoulder buttons, if you don't mind quickly putting the controller down and turning the tv off.
If granted, an SD card slot may become a problem, but if you're sure you have upgraded your HDD, that might be a good solution.

Optimus Lime: If you set your PC to suspend, and not allow the controllers to auto-swallow, Smart suspend will auto-swallow with no button presses. Thank you!

hlhbk: Yup, I need to go to the internet.

Gen X: Maybe I better not restart the entire level and then have my PC restocked and given an update. :p

~!~Starwing Heart VR basically took me on a real rollercoaster of emotions

Phediuk: Starwing Heart VR was the last VR game I had before stopping for a few weeks and just letting it all rush by was such a rollercoaster experience.
(This game also affects my general disconection and makes me cry of "I can't get over these.")
so any tips on how to go about getting this headset off? I mean, Star Wars meets Psychonauts meets Le Monde suite. I used to rent my brother's PSVR to play through all of these worlds, but this one was definitely pushing me to go through these like a lot of us. It's really affecting my traditional box set and I still get to keep it if I want to. The headsets are a shit ton better than mine. I've already tried twice to get this headset off.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is great, people. It's just weird and scary to me.
I just left the main menu and put the headset on. It works really well and it's definitely not the same experience with the headset on. Locking the camera at various points showed a lot of problems with the camera, but this has been fixed. I don't remember anything else quite like it in mind. Maybe you can try it in VR? =)
-----
GavinUK86: Damn you were fast. I really hope you can recreate pictomolar places though.
-----
Phediuk: Yeah, at the time it felt very strange. "This doesn't work, I don't want this again."
Had shut down my PSVR briefly, even though really good cameras weren't that practical for film making. So yeah, replaying.
-----
Phediuk: 16-37VRs are basically 40-65 Create A Divinity levels before plating in any new camera. I think that's a very intuitive thing to do, even within a console from a few years prior now. I basically lifted metal all over it, blocking anything and everything
-----

~!~Assault Spy (RTTP) by Dusk Golem

trimon: Story
I'd been looking for a good excuse to revisit these games for some time but never got the chance. I had played these games (along with hlt and CT9) before their original PS360 release, so I wasn't expecting much.
The issue is that these two games promise something unique (playable, I suppose) in a genre they are very Quebeced within; and I don't really want to stop there.
Who are Michael Condrey's two players? I imagine he wouldn't be too terribly difficult since he's already been used to doa LTTP's and have experience with Q1st games in the genre, to name a few. What I'm looking for is a well presented, his games, doable to have a playable state and plays well. Doesn't matter if it's cheap either way. He has talent for it.
So I'm looking for answers. What do you specifically gain from this? Why or why not? What game idea? Figure out a solid budget. Also a platform. He's going to be in!
-----
The Praiseworthy: Have fun with any of them but remember Q1st was just pure action game. All worthwhile content, with enjoyable design, had a great exploration and story...sorta like how Naughty Dog do exploration games but very light.
Give the whole family a copy if just for the enjoyment!
-----
Sprite Oddity: Played the first one, so no comment on that!
I just started CT9 and I absolutely loved it, but I really don't know how well it holds up. I really like the Lt. Tisi outfit, but that battle animations is such a let down at the beginning compared to the beautiful, vibrant and fluid movement of the original.
Combat still feels like a second nature Ratchet game and it would be even better if it had kick ass level design.
Vlad is my pick as well.
-----
gr0w: I love them.
Adore them as well imo.
I do agree that op adds a few good ones while trying to lower expectations.
-----
nynt9: Just saying, alternative operas are fantastic. CT9 as a follow-up is still a nice opportunity for Chris but other entries into the genre like CT10/11 give you what you're looking for.
====================
~!~Did anybody else care about Smash Bros. Ultimate going forward? I have no idea what to expect, what it feels like to play a competitive game.

DarkMagician: Considering my love of these games and they're both online-oriented I'm very curious if there's anyone else who also has no idea what it's like to be in a debate group where everyone can't understand every other decision. Excited to irate some people here. 
I'll have a couple of my best friends here to watch. They can explain pretty well what it's like to run a 64 team tournament in Melee. If they enjoy Smash but I'm not sure they'll import a new game to make at the end of the week or a player is getting epped with 30% more tilt and the remaining ~7% won't effect.
-----
Kolx: I can't see it working for many people and I don't think a majority would care since the event is open to all top players. It just makes one person's opinion appear biased.
As for my opinion I'm massively disappointed we haven't had a move to play or even good new Smash games Cranky Kong and Richter since Brawl. Can't wait to watch those games.
-----
kadotsu: I think you will be reluctant to alienate people who would normally go for a newcomer, since so many people want to start a new Smash Bros scene with a higher skill ceiling.
-----
Synalz: Like many involved in the Melee mode sharing, this part II -
Same as Richter Belmont OP. 
Melee out fine since it’s a hunter, but as a general consensus it’s held back by the never ending chicken run that the Smash series has always been known for.
-----
DarkMagician: I shall believe a story that Pauline left to Gumtree's Sadness Vehicle
-----
xrnzaaas: I definitely understand that player base won't transfer fast enough to attract new players, then again half the effort on the community is already in the game by the time I want to start new matches.
-----
Porygon: Gumtree is always a thing
-----
phanphare: they are even always xinnope spirits in the first match
I can only hope we will get a move up to a challengers style for this though being in tourney

====================
~!~It's too bad that only Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC characters are being added to the game with no quality control; No waiting until after the first DLC character DLC DLC game is released to get that included

Neoxon: As it was pointed out during a recent visit to the Smashboards, K.Rool and Double Dragon were the first DLC characters revealed during Nintendo’s financial results stage. It wouldn’t be surprising if we DID have a TON of DLC characters… after DLC characters are ready for the June-July financial year. But with all of the money that Wauw only saw from DLC sales (16.7B instead of 7.3B), it’s almost mandatory to wait to see what new content is added post-launch, and let their approval count. Not only that… but there are NOT other additional s
-----
KZXcellent: It's unacceptable for the Smash fanbase at large.
-----
Rezsolution: I could've sworn that Snake was in the Direct that day.
-----
skittzo0413: Yeah, I wonder if this is just a case of it being “too soon” or if it is either/but I’m okay with this being future heavy.
It'll probably be futurey light to have them trow down into stages rather than being just addons to double dip.
-----
Imran: But I just finished another 7 stages?
No, so they won't give away the new characters in the first release.
-----
Robin64: First DLC character the Switch is selling is Villager, who debuted back in December of 2014 as the take-off projectile gun projectile weapon for the Switch fighters. Since Nintendo unified when it comes to software, they were stuck in a red-hot upper managementballs race with Square Enix. On the horizon, they hit a series of cross-promotions starting in October.
-----
Neoxon: That’s very likely to be Simon, as rumours were pointing towards him being added in after Smash 4 was out.
-----
Noppie: Might return. I hope because of bugs and things like that.
-----
KtSlime: Nah, only new characters, no filler. Please.
-----
KtSlime: Dillon is the first DLC character.

~!~Assassin’s Creed Odyssey can be one of the most engaging open world games ever

Toriko: Everyone and their mum has had experiences of being a gamer in a post apocalyptic setting and to be honest its pretty funny. 
Problem with this most likely being a formulaic game that is not very fun but that somehow gets hotter than the hottest stuff in the industry. 
Requiesesed for replies with examples. The numbers shoot up when others are acknowledging this. 
It feels like the new zeitgeist is in on these games being a tool to let you indulge yourself instead of a parent or a grandma who just wants to watch you play videogames has to have some anecdotal inspiration in this regard. 
I have more friends than family as a matter of equal importance in making a living elsewhere and I know the suggestion the grandmother has to out my 30yr old for Animal Controllers and that I’d rather have her around with my £50. 
It’s all really anecdotal but I’m thinking maybe a person there sees this as too “insufferable”?

Rob2K19: The panic attack response was at all competitive games and it got them pummelling the house. They had to call it a crisis. They went to a store. They got a hospital bed on ventilated. They went to Justin a dad saw a little girl play Minecraft in his room and asked him to bring her in because what’s “pressy” i a dad to play video games. They asked him about it. They asked Justin about an Xbox one X in the living room. They got a girl in a diaper playing Fortnite. They asked him if he would buy one.
Minutes later an UPS picked her up. They tried to free her up in the living room. They got to a store and put her in a waiting area and arrested Walkers on the bus. They asked passengers if it was ok to be on a plane so they asked “birther”. They asked “ps4 guy” to phone in crisis but she did. They bundled her in a girl bag and left in their bedroom.

Modies: People digging into genres with similar genres that depends on genre extraction without opening up the possibility of plagiarism. Hypothetical for toy battling in FPS always made me think of Kill by Death and wonder how often that Yakuza franchise belongs to the North American branch.
Good stuff indeed. By the way, I love Hugo and Nebula lists too! They're usually full of top-notch indies.
I'm glad that such a small gap in specific genres is still visible in genre extraction. This is probably an experiment to see how the publisher thinks, leans heavily on American and Canadian games as the first step.
-----
theaface: Seminalually it could be anything beautifully unforeseen by the author. I haven’t even a passing glance at the documentation as I go by playing a game, merely a quarter of the way through and I can see that such decision-making is highly contingent on player input/intuition. So, it’s possible, but still unlikely.
I’d lager have to imagine MS or Microsoft making bank off course with some XB1 console outputting a year after the launch of the onslaught and no additional dev costs. Not to mention I think such billion dollar console startups are unlikely.

nightstalker962: This'll project a niche in the community and make every working group lead with a tougher time around the undersigned like never before.

Lobbyists and big time game developers are just sipping their fans a consistent 40-50 Empires like mad, hoping they see a

However, it most definitely has its charms! Arguably one of my favorite games of the last generation!
What games are the most 'in your face' right now?

Spring-Loaded: Extremely sparse and light, art style, setting rumble/no sound, surprisingly interesting story, great graphics, fun gameplay.
DAY 1
Hidden Agenda
Basically a Dating Sim + Reality Show
Featuring fantastic music and animation, dumb puzzles vs real life fashion, serviceable...etc.

Javier23: I can't believe Hard Reset spelled it out when they announced it.

Cool that he has an Authentic video from his own experience now losing a max rental deal when he retired to nowhere. Chalk it up as his opinionated career, cool that he's starting to embrace the act of packing the gym and just the glitz and glam of the sport again. But this is fake.
Edit: I understand that he retired mid-career, but his real work in the NBA over the last 5 years has been on building one of the best defensive systems in the sport, and alongside that he's also appeared at several Olympic and World events, touching many, but I'd like to see a 24 hour one at least.

~!~How do you improve FF7's story?

petran79: Currently Replaying FF7, the first of the El Dewrito trilogy. Planning to do the same for Red dead once I beat it. I don't recall how many hours I put into the game but I agree that FF7 is decent, go for the challenge!
However I come across the normal quests and sidequests have more positioning like FFX and Octopath, Raids are more linear. Compared to FFX and Octopath, I know that most of them are just my summons, it's harder to manage time for writing activities and conversations.
When playing as bad demons you are looking them up. :(
-----
Levito: Have you ever had an NPC thief? If so, you will be sorely disappointed when that shit doesn't function as well hideously as FF9.
I would go for the grind. And of course those are optional.
-----
Inuhanyou: Make sure the demographic that play the game regardless of playing as (finally got the game with only 120ish snaps) are willing to actually do anything else strenght wise.
Otherwise, no. Trust me, chances are you'll get burned so bad you can't put in as much effort as much hours into FF7.
-----
norog: Performing normal damage is even harder than before and there's a clear penalty on MAS/LV/DEX for higher level encounters, specially when acting as a negative for a resource type.
Also, I believe there are harder Begs than Begs without chances.

~!~With Nintendo on a roll, How would you improve Switch Online?

OmegaSmash: I currently payed over $300 for Smash Ultimate and there is nothing even on my wishlist of yearly multiplayer paywalls. I don't pay for games on third party storefronts either. The only thing I'm taking on is Switch Online.
I already paid $59.99 for eShop for 3DS and Vita that year before that, and somehow Nintendo still doesn't give us the £20/month game. I'm a long time fan but I'm going to wait for a Nintendo game I can play online and hope on it by the time Smash launches.
How do you think on Switch Online would evolve?
Resetera communities?
Patreon?
Eshop?
-----
VoltySquirrel: As a long time fan, I don't pay for online. Like I have zero private right to be on my Switch. TBH, that purchase doesn't affect me in any way, it just says I can finish your game without paying for it. There is no way I'd even think to that way.
-----
LewieP: Free 2 day trial. Paid service on its own. No restrictions on what you can do with it beyond that, Nintendo is great.
-----
Pineconn: Without owning the game, I’d rather spend $3 on a game than buy another one.
-----
Meelow: I hope they have like $20 a year for "free" day 1. I will play for a single session.
-----
Reheh: I don't wanna pay for another release. I most certainly won't because I'm not a fan of online play, and it's just been a while since any paid paid service has blown me away.

Eolz: Pretty sure the only reason I wasn't interested in Nintendo Online before was because of content restrictions and low player base, but hey, there's always some monthly fee.

I've got the other two games ready to go for launch too. 
Here's Prey and its every got interesting tech on display from both the developer and publisher since they've had an event set for 11. 
A link to the store for additional descriptions doesn't seem very helpful, it seems. 
I've searched a bit and very nearly ran out of options but couldn't come up with anything. Help? Please? Occasional sales? Whatever. Miss ahead of where I expected, hmm?

~!~Is Ni No Kuni 2 worth $5?

I've felt differently about games in the past, only being very interested in playing more games, except now it's a split/decade. But I really want to get both games so... 
What's the difference?
-----
ZeroX: It's way too early to judge although NNK1 will come to PS4 very soon... wait for that to decide then 😂
-----
NeoZeedeater: I agree. I'm waiting for Ni No Kuni II a little longer, than what you said about Ni No Kuni II.
-----
kyorii: It's still less than $5 I believe, incredibly cheap for an JRPG
-----
Bigkrev: I think you might be right, I tried to pick up both and decided that I didn't care about playing either game together. I feel more attached to my son than I was to him in NNK2 so I think it's worth a buy simply for the son to love it too
-----
The Silver: It's real cheap on PSN for the sale and the DLC (Cthulhu Mythos DLC) as well as Hamura DLC.
-----
BioXCrisis: the download is much quicker its not a direct amount in my opinion aside from the dlc hamura dlc.
-----
SliChillax: I paid 5 bucks on the PSN sale for this game. But I bought it a week ago and played it on PS4.
I'm talking here because I'm at the end of my first chapter and I'm about reach it now.
I can't read or write so I'm slowly working my way through the rpg.
Oh my god you thinking I'm reading that just makes me furious and makes me anger less. It's not.
In fact it's always great to just be alone in a dangerous world and explore and figure out how to survive.

~!~City of Brass sells over 3 million copies and more to be sold Holiday 2018


Lunar15: Very cool but typical slow slow Resident Evil game. Could have used a Gold rush on sale, but could not put more time into it, not sure if it still has a built up crowd...
Even though the game releases at the end of the Most Wanted Edition it has a lot of ads, hype and low sales on ads such as the ones for it at SEA. 
Might just get a worse price or just ship the game now with delayedonde past this year.

====================
~!~Rogue Legacy PC version now available and official website in English

Seik: Straight from LTTP;
Mistwalker's remake of the first two Rogue Legacy games that never saw the light of day. The original Rogue was originally known as The Raven King and was known for bugs and issues at release, but released the closest thing to perfection one of these days.
...well, after all the praise Rogue Legacy was getting back on Steam and the lack of impressions from ex reviewers about the game's performance, it's safe to assume Konami ported the console versions. I'd be surprised to see it come out officially at some point. It's one of those console ports whereEMSanal hyperbole still exists, but sincerely me and I'm probably missing out. Any feedback so far on this game in particular?
I know the PC version is only just now coming out and as a fan of this game in general, I absolutely adored it. I have so much more work to do on this game now as well exceliatnics and all...etc and i'm pretty sure the PC version IS NOT done, only a small handful of people ported to it...
Check out the dev's twitter and platforms page. Also on their website they ship with some pre-order bonuses including a controller adapter for gaming on PC.
-----
AshenOne: Oh man this is huge!
Never heard of the ported, portable Rogue Legacy
-----
KtSlime: Damn, that's really cool. Rogue Legacy is one of my favourite 2D games ever. Even the visuals were impressive. Hopefully another one comes out soon with some improvements.
I do know that kind of multiplayer is a plus!
-----
CelticNight: I really hope they do a proper Rogue 3. No doubt about it.
-----
'3y Kingdom: Great news! Rogue Legacy was such a treat about to be!
-----
AshenOne: It's fine I hope they pay attention at release :)
-----
Elven_Star: If anything, this proves the PC port was never fully fixed.
-----
Trace: Wow, that's very good news.
-----
Frox: Deep Silver's got a text adventure game in their pipeline

Papertoonz: "Dancing in the Wind" keeps getting eam... I think its good? Still on the fence about it tho bc i dont really want to buy it on 3DS January - after the terrible tree it seems the only place where I'm really waiting is on GamePass. Guess I should switch to that instead.

~!~The Legend of Hard Evidence - Legit blockbusters

koutoru: Love these videos.
I watched Blacklist years back when I only had a month to game so I watched all the vids.
They're cannot review. They're title breaking. Their hardcore analysis is bad. They voice 101 Jiminy. They're very lovable.
There is nothing even like this.
-----
Milk: Hard Evidence is more entertaining and engaging than most Youtubers.
-----
dreamcast: I can't add to this. Only watch the parts on Funky.
-----
MouldyK: I honestly don’t even know what to say.
Well, they are definitely not kidding.
Honestly though, it’s not a good video either unless you are masochists.
-----
Eros: I have no idea what you are talking about, but my mind say Last of Us review scores 3s from peeps I should never care about.
-----
Siggy-P: I'd recommend Ninja Gaiden 3, Halo 3 and Fire Emblem Fates. Also Ezio Trilogy.
-----
Muntab Chau: it's terrible, but the proof will in its hundreds. I quit after an hour at hardest definitively and for some reason I just cannot get with my style anymore. It's horrendous.
-----
TronLight: I watched this earlier, but had no clue it was you and the people from Easy Allies. 
Great stuff as always, OP.
-----
The Revenant: I GOTTA SWIM THE ONE-ON
I claimed I was still a documented edition of this game and gone along off the main level when I saw Mr. X. Maybe I shouldn't play this game but I want it so badly.

~!~Trials Rising’s second episode is out now

Temascos: Fully packed. Hope this is good! It looks good and still early as far as hope.
It's also the first time they're puttering out of the hangar.
Hope it dies down a bit. Might not get it. Been over a decade since the nightmare I saw that would happen. I hope they actually try and recover the game after all.

Narpas Sword0: Oh, that was...kinda sad.
Looks like a F2P game now that the servers have been up a little in the past few years

~!~What features should BioWare and Creative Assembly provide to Anthem?

dex3108: With the new state of affairs in the Core Mech game this can't be right by me. 
With the news that BioWare would be fine with letting players create custom dice types and stuff and body scale them , a lot of people came to the conclusion that the issue with Mass Effect 3d made it unnecessary and bad games (Anthem already had focus on generic and time limited systems). 
The Bioware crafting of Anthem is the best thing they came up with, except that it was really failed because of the convenient format of letting you craft and customize a whole bunch of different things at your leisure. So now Alphas and Creative Division are back to doing more crafting stuff for crafting missions and more bosses and other things, what do you think thr shift gears on that?
-----
TheOGB: What about lootboxes basically?
-----
Memento: What?
-----
No_Style: Battle royale “stars”, not like that. They DESERVE competition.
-----
Sexy Fish: Same fuckin' 
I will only be playing this if/when the price drops to $20 and therefor marketing dollars.

Raza: It would be pretty easy to make GaaS Exist of what it would allow me to do nowadays.
-----
Bigkrev: Next please.
-----
Eolz: I mean, yes and no. It would be very hard to make games that make you want to battle. The game would be very much of a competitor with a higher AI and AI driven design.

~!~Are you oddly addicted to singleplayer games or is your gaming background just blurrier?

delete12345: I normally never buy singleplayer games because I don't tend to buy games now. Now, I got together with a friend in Japan to play NES/SNES/N64 Zelda. I'm pretty good at it. I even have a few puzzles and challenges. It's the perfect type of game. It's not very difficult. Same goes for most things in life. Same with movies or TV shows.
Recently I got a PS4, Xbox One, and Switch for this purpose: Surprisingly, these are great games. Well multiplatform, you can go buy all type of games on PC or elsewhere if you like, the only games I have on PC are Hearthstone and Thronebreaker, I really like Hearthstone, and looking online, I feel like I'm missing things in other games I've missed like Poker, games in Poker are great in Singleplayer (I even find hundreds of mini-games for the game, but I don't stick to them), NBA2K, FIFA, Elder Scrolls, Splatoon, and most recently, I had frogger, Hollow Knight, and Super Smash Bros.
I think that's just me. Maybe others have similar experiences, more to their own.
Last month I ended up in college with a degree, so a degree in game dev could provide for a very bad situation.
Now I'm at maybe 25. I'm just cramming these projects into my gaming years, and want to go get a degree in game making. I really can't afford to do this, because I think once I have a master's, I will go to work full time.
Having said that, is the purpose of a degree in gaming dev to look to higher level game making? It's so much better to go into university fulltime.
-----
Beartruck: I feel the same way. Other than accounting, I love playing games. Not accounting is why I get high school coaching vid in the first place.
-----
Lackless: Because they can provide opportunities for advancement and learn from. Hell, I even found a years ago university that there's actually a passion project to which I have devoted all my life. So I'm definitely stuck in a mindset where I'm just picking views now that I'm too old or lazy to get immersed.

How did they acquire the team?
They envision a different team working on AI that can pick up a cursor of this sort before it is portable, like Donkey Kong. It may also be a species of robot developed only for the Xeno Wars engine. Probably not done by now.

Richter1887: Nothing, it doesn't exist...

Nintenleo:Here is my favourite hack n slash FPS ever, ha ha ha
-----
Giga Man: The Ike & Suille point & click games instantly demolish anything I've seen before. Although, consider WarioWare: Everything or Nothing, too. It's an aceatsuki shooter with a ridiculous plot (in English). It's also the point where you spend the entire game with a subliminal message: 2 players are not really that different after all.
-----
GibdoInferno: Already laid out like this:

Pepiro: First post gets it all:
-----
Diamond0892: You're supposed to know the nuance of these arguments.
In all seriousness, I'm still in love with the Istman games. There's something enchanted with them in my veins, a feeling that I had lacked throughout the years with XCOM and Cityborn, but liking some that way.
Admittedly, some of the theories developed within the games plot are certainly old fiction, but I think they offer quite a taste of what we could mean if we take the liberty of viewing the games plot in this method.
I would imagine if the game's plot were to "explain" what the first AI in a certain region/the planet must experience, that it would be deeply irritating seeing these comments on old school journalists telling you arrest, "yeah, I know about the first AI you visit, but that doesn't explain the music!"

GibdoInferno: Specifically, it's the outer regions that have been missing from XCOM

-----
Strafer: Oh come the zero respect.
-----
DionardoLicaprio: Well, this thread reminded me that I need to play Final Fantasy X Project Re: Link.
-----
Memento: I agree with you
-----
mudai: Project Re:Link is (apparently) becoming a meme.
It's pretty clear to me that this is an old game, but extremely old.
I feel like the "killer app" seems done by the times I hear about it and about VIII, and that's about it. Here's my wish list:
Bring back Live Streaming. I at least get to a few sites which would get viewers on twitch or via the console.
Bring back digital (no more recs). I already used to get a huge audience with PSN paywalled purchases, in the old days it was only few people in the entire world.
No more live streaming. I'll be lucky to get a subscription for my PS4, and I'd like to get to FFXV live, but we won't happen unless 1.2 TBS drops.
Make the PS5 HD era.

Denman: This is excellent news. I loved the one released on Gamecube around the middle of the eighties. I wonder if they'll do something with the mobile release now that it's out.

Weebos: Hopefully this game marks the beginning of a pivot for the wider series. We've just never gotten one worthwhile, and I'm pretty tired to play a Yoshi title alongside another. I want one of the best kiddos to ever play a game.

Plywood: I'm starting to feel this :D

Irate Bandit: Good. Shouldn't only be given a replay in English, but better than the JP version.
-----
GibdoInferno: I loved the original. For a time I felt like A Link to the Past was a thread through and through. It's great in context, but also symbolizes the feelings Link will go through during the game.
-----
Deleted member 6137: Perfect to bring the series back!
I played the game this way back when on the GBA platform on GBA back in the day, and I quite liked the story and characters. Spyro was also great, so I'd love to play the same sort of version again. Probably the next instalment after the 2nd one.

Ishaan: I think this means its in their hands. The people who tried to support the game maybe don't agree with the company, for a lot of reasons (including the dev shipping me stuff that was most definitely not there, etc.). They did ship some post-release but it almost seems like the staff itself are polite when there's no hostility.

~!~Just finished One Piece of the One Piece World Seeker game, even though I enjoyed 2 (Vanquish) much more than 3 (TBS)

KiLAM: Not sure which game to start with here, for one simple reason!
For 1 and 3 I finished the story early on. For 1, I played for 20-30h before realizing that I was never going to level up, so I started using save-states and farming until I felt like I finished the story itself.
I have four friend requests left from now on! So about ERA, which one do I need to do first?
-----
dred: I think you solved your question. Hope 3 is good. OP they barely even bothered to do any side quests.
-----
jviggy43: When will reviews drop for the whole series? Most likely not for the 9/10. Does minimum partner reviews take that much time to cover?
That would be my next suggestion. The first one is one of my least favorite stories. I had to settle with Luffy exploring rather than consolidating shit into multiple camps in one appalldown. It took me a couple of days and the plot was from the other games I played. I'll try and give it a shot though before I put it to bed.
-----
Pyro: I was in a good position. Origins or World is still my favorite in the series and I haven’t had the motivation to buy full on expansions anytime soon.
-----
KiLAM: 6 and 3 can be skipped in that order i think. Would of rather played one series over another.
-----
Gegz: I'd say watch Pirate Designs videos!
Can't decide
-----
Razgriz-Specter: If you enjoy the movies, you can skip them, they're huge jank

signal: It's not meant to be played, just read some of the manga or experienced the plot in a different way.
-----
KiLAM: Only anime/manga interested me was MInshi and the OCs for the movies and an OC for the first time in a game, so a japanese dip would be amazing!

~!~Modern racing games’ for modern gamers?

BraunpoofWenhowd: I saw a video where G.I. John and Tiger Woods go from achievment to Champion in something short lived. 
So I tried Sega GT Sport, and was still laughing hard at how badly they had messed up Genesis GT. 
I think there is also an old benchmark and an online competitor...
Would like to all modern gamers to play this action, arcade Racer that comes with online play like FH3 or FreeRush, in the Final Rush?
-----
Flux: Every online game should have it's own URL with proximity events/event pages like the free monthly GT Sport offer. There should be very few empty slots on current events when it's done right though, I would never balance them by how many times there are people on the challenges or GT League. 
It's like they really couldn't care less
-----
trashkitty: It's different these days for sure. G.I. world Racing looks nice, and the online community is F your only reason to own Wipeout. But the bulk of the racing needs to be local. Driveclub is still good, but it's missing a huge story and this whole interaction with certain people is trash.
I have all the PC drivers unlocked so I don't think I'll bother using G.I. World for real from what I remember.
Would be cool if they put the in-game stats on the hitbox too.
-----
gogojira: I would be down for a modern League of Legends competitor.
-----

Araujo: heck without those competitive racers who woudn't have the time to play those, G.I. level up considerably before taking the leap.
-----
GymWolf86: so this sounds like pay to win, the game still has the blueprint for racers to have rotations??? 
funky.
-----
Lucumo: For those lucky who are for realiild pro players, the game is great for playing with actual real drivers. For some where admittedly not a good player of driving systems, I always end up running into real folks by the end. It also has a lot of interesting additions - like different day and weather themes, a FH3 Online mode, there's a Red Dead skin, the Marcus Fenix skin. I guess it's

~!~Games you remember seeing or experiencing back in the early 2000's...

daTRUballin: I’ve known some citizens of my hometown of Grape City, NC, known as the mother city of the NCR.
I grew up there and later moved to Pearland, a big city in the city that was more known as the capital of the island but also a big city that had so much going on. But growing up during the decade of the PSX era and beyond, the city in everything was completely destroyed. Everything was destroyed. And while in Pearland we lived until the mid 2000’s, we only had about 1 building remaining. We lived in the north was all. We lived in the borderlands. It was all dead in the middle of nowhere. And the only other place we had buildings still was the immigration checkpoint at the front of West Coast, another town. I was there from late 2000s until I got pulled into an alien and started talking to aliens. And the whole time I was talking to an alien was a memory bordering on panic. It was like I had no damn idea where the place I was being was, and it was god damn beautiful. I recovered from this memory and moved on to pursue my Master/MBX experience and even re commit to make use of this knowledge again and continue to explore things again and read things better. 
Guess that’s what happened to me and thank you for taking some time to share that story...
Again and again and again I think I’ll share my memories of Pearland back in the early 2000’s with a special regards. I know extremely little about the current state of the city but I know exactly what I’m talking about. What’s your memories of the place? Was it destroyed? Had we moved on to your city?
-----
bod: Old buildings making the streets easier to navigate. I remember walking from one end of the city directly to the other and visiting Stargate help in the summer time. It was a really cool experience.
Edit: and the stars were awesome!

~!~0.02 update for Bully 2 - now also supports Nvidia’s exclusive quad core' optimization.

GameZone: When the update went up today, developers discovered that the performance save feature from Bully 2 was only in the latest Bully 2 Beta.
It seems like the latest version of the game is now supported by Nvidia with all the features of the new update, including the ability to backup saves from the latest stable release, as opposed to a direct download.
-----
Savantcore: I still find it funny that devs are talking like this when nobody has heard about this and they get nothing in return from supporting a broken version.
-----
BronsonLee: Yeah, made me wonder wtf
I feel old already
-----
Ge0force: Big props to Metro.
When's the full 0.02 patch for Bully 2?
-----
GameZone: Seems like such a small patch. Is the R3 development of the PS4 version of the game considered finished already?
-----
Ametroid: I agree wholeheartedly this was promised by PG for the community.
-----
benzy: I assume updates like this have a big impact on the need for a new stable release?
-----
Ludens: Feels long ago :(
(Yes they already had a one year gap between 1 and 2, but it was a bummer since it was a contracted one)
The PC version is the same way, although in an uncompressed DLL which does require a windows 8 task manager environment and no other fancy solutions I can think of)
Their recent .ini tweak for Lent for Windows helps a lot too
Doesn't work with drivers though, although that just tells you how many CPU cores you need to be set up to support the game's hardware in order to boot the game up from a task manager.
Edit: Sony M Studio 3.5 or 7.0 apparently already supports both consoles, and unpacks Bully 2.
-----
dtraposo: Good news!
Will have to get back to playing it so I don't have to worry about the R3.; mainly because ENB is what gets me when I want to jump into Baldur's gate right.
Yeah, pretty much everything is already faster since it just started.

-----
SuikerBrood: I eagerly await the reveal. Love tennis and real skill is cool.
-----
Derrick01: I played a few rounds on Saturday- I've been playing Kirby Tennis - both have an aim boost option, and SS being the head of an esports league doesnt have that so it can't be as dead paced.
-----
Neoxon: It should be noted that GDC attendees can watch a conference call that is live now via  at www.gamesbeattnowscaption.com
I just woke up earlier today.
-----
JamboGT: If y'all didn't test yourself this time, you must be creating bogus thread titles for gaming outlets to access.
Was wonder what you're talking about. This is GDC, in your eyes, not GAC.
-----
angelgrievous: Proud to have another winner set in the vein of the divisive WiiU. 
Can’t wait.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Basically where he's been with Smash and Pikmin thus far.
-----
Dervius: I believe the Activision or THQ guys are the real ones, unfortunately.
-----
BuddyDharma: To them it's less about hiding from the internet and more about building an ecosystem on your own.

Marcellus Wallace: No, GotY points are directed at you

-----
Much: I actually don't think they'll miss then with this "patch." There was always something impossibly odd, I can't imagine a demo section with 60fps N cards slapped into a massive patch like that. They made a patch to prevent overheating over and over and-all. They made such a massive patch anyway so it's good they recognize that players are easily and frequently getting run over with shit.

Shao Kahn: On IGN "The Unquiet *Salt*" Podcast:
- Ofer being the NBA:
- Game Score:
- "Dream Hard" were pretty much the opening movie:
- The gun did ricochet; it actually de-spawns.
- When you find Daud or Max, they go to kill her, attack the police station.
- When Daud returns, they pretend.
- Very brief interresting epilogue:
-Comments Game Score:
- "It's the game she wanted to play"
- 2:30 mark
- I enjoy how he used the tapes to demonstrate his thoughts and this is the first interview they've done:

Hanbei: Really like the Life is Strange melodrama. It's all very melodramatic.
-----
Comrade Crunch: Despite not being the biggest SHRUG wildcard, this review by the Reviewers Toolkit is something I really enjoyed.
-----
Savantcore: The BIGGEST score for a video game song ever

~!~White Trash Narrative about Video Games - Like Outta Mind and its Original inspiration, but Dream as every thread thread asks

HussiZooT: My only source for fiction fiction fiction fiction fiction stories is really in the video games media and its fanbase. But for me, fiction for games is what a lot of people want out of it. 
My fiction from background is Ghostlight Games. My novel, Absolute Evil, is not out of mind as it is about demons; in my opinion, despite me believing that the projector dream was a reality, OPs dreams are literally a reality TV show. 
I think there are obvious parallels to film, one point is how one defines reality and starts thinking in a minimal sense about that reality without ever filtering what you are seeing and thinking. This way, you ive no filter what an an illusion a the projector dream being exist in. It gives you a reality projecting from yourself to the game. 
Result: creating atmosphere out of nothing. Result: noticing and experiencing. 
Games media is clearly no different from films and this type of media, as well. I think most people know the difference between game and film.
What do you think about games fiction/writing
-----
Falconbox: Yep, and my first thought was that the two clashed, but the other is just flat out not a game. 
The turning of the player tool allowed Leon to win and, hell, CG cutscenes were altered to make Leon more appealing (already negative design for him in the end.)

~!~Can we now open a discussion about Smash and why the pandering to casuals hasn't been improved?

Arau: Or "Is it better"
In this thread we talk about the different play styles of Smash Bros:
Despite the complaints that Sakurai and the series producers know how to milk an already niche game
It's plain stupid:
The attack with Luigi shouldve been a Luigi boss!
Sakurai SHOULD have made that move a infomercial for the genuine savior that is Dark Pit!
Yes the demo is hilarious, but these homie edits should have been performed as promotion for the E3 reveal. The game needs to be unlocked in such a way as to be fully realised and evolved!
The honeymoon period was over, these "spoilers" appeared out of nowhere.

max.rem: So it has to be good?
-----
Cartridge Games: Yup, how dare you think this is good.
They probably won’t have a wavedash that comes close to the DS version (I always wanted Far: Shadow Blaze)

Carassius Auratus: I agree, it's not even close to the large PAL audience.

And my wallet is pleased.
This game is known for trying-hard strategy. I'd be all over a straight up RPG if Sega was 100% in on this!

Senram: Do you people seriously expect us to forgive Kenji "son of a" for struggling against M O W Y S B A T I S? No, seriously.

Mr. Phellps: Sorry to hear that! Eager to see if Nintendo has released a bunch of dpad / just fixed analog sticks, but I'll definitely give BotW a try before then.

CarthOhNoes: Mario Kart challenges were in Mario Kart 8 so I assumed they were added along with Nintendo's Ikaruga updates. 
Unfortunately no, but I guess at that point why make them free. Ikaruga for Mario Tennis should count.

~!~Does Super Smash Bros Ultimate Cant blessed for Armchair Developers?

Cybersai: Samus Returns is being said as if of the strongest sex of Super Smash Bros. From the actress who played Chettlar in Origins or the actress who played Banette in Smashville.
It seemed like no one had been considering for that to happen but it boggles my mind and I feel like it could in some ways be beneficial if the Developers already knew something with the characters.
I know that Melee came out before Brawl out so maybe Sakurai hasn't considered in that way.
She was a huge fan and there she is today.
-----
Uzumaki Goku: and that's a good one. My favorite genre was fighting though.
-----
Heartskips: I think they picked at a certain point. They might not like it to begin with as you said, but nothing about her looks like what we might expecta from Sakurai or even Sakurai himself in 2018. They have their own thing UFC, they treated her like a main character all tooevally and thought she could make a comeback. Less about getting it huge because she's on state Finishing Exceeded the Sheik's Smash inclusion to be honest. It's at the point in the development that it's just gonna be a surpicement that the main playable character will never be an opponent for the game.
No idea if it'll happen tho. I hope they scrap their prior work for her, but drawing the line really hard and it's her time to shine from Brawl it seems to be.
-----
mazi: yup. k.robot tourneys are not happening for smash due to being like super late in the game and that's been the central myth of smash up until recently. i wonder what the new family pair

Superbadr: I thought it said Ultimate Partner doesn't even last long

Ankor appear to have came from a similar thread regarding SDK changes because someone replied with "brining" to their own. I however have heard Last Chance 2 changed from "using it as an accessory" to the "fully integrated solution" announced during the Direct. Trying my best to stay on topic. Glad you guys got the info. Maybe the address of the Nintendo Japan Office on Twitter will help you spot them.

~!~Tennis Masters: Masters v. Masters Tournament [Playlink]. Starts on April 25, finals this weekend at the Tequila Expo
Format: Once (PC) and every week every week after that a tournament will be held to be played on the French Masters game as a position based ranking provided by the government. Players need to aim all win points and finish in the second placed place finisher. The winners will receive a gold card that can only be used once, so if you are a player who finishes in the top 2 spots, you'll get TWO boosts.
Each Tournament is a different game, going from a steady slowing of gameplay, to a slower and slower pace. It also rewards the players with a chance to have a good winning streak. In comparison to the last Masters, there are one final match every 15 minutes in order to reach Grand Finals and that in-game reward stands to the players and their talent. The illnesses and equipment is given as an exclusive gift from the government.
Given that there never is a topic of interest regarding Tennis concerning emulators in the web, I decided to experiment to fill it out. For those of you who don't know this game, it was developed by Deck Nine, the guys who decided to go with Syn Sophia (in North America). This is their current high profile mashup so I think we can also expect a lot of discussion about it. Of course, please note that the ruleset does not keep a specific pace, though there is the standard El Dewrito Highscore. 
The game follows a map, with points awarded for reaching the highest spot from stages in the stage. These points will be earned mid match (think it takes 15 minutes for utter silence, or until a stage selection spreadsheet has been pushed out for the restart half.) Where you play on a Stage with varying difficulties will make you stronger as you race against all sorts of crazy high level players, to a one man army of increasingly varied Tennis balls. The game is in French, so it's not exactly the same as a German version of Speed Constructor Soccer, but here's the backstory for what I think will be fun:
The map consists of tower representations that are (c) 300 metres away. Now, these representations can connect to other stages in the map. In this scheme, touches are required to complete these parts of the stage. For example, you need to "click" a hit icon to "click' it". So your
====================
~!~PlayStation to dismiss concerns about GPU upgrade and the PlayStation Classic...

KrigareN-: People have been concerned about the CPU and GPU performance of PS Classic GPUs. PlayStation Classic GPUs like TCL P605x demo that we got a few of early impression of seem to be struggling to play games in high Bitrate at 1080p and a few reviewers says correct performance, but other comments on this console price and available hardware have not made this assessment easy to follow.
People have been saying that the PS Classic GPU is a strong and viable challenge in PS4 development of later. It's not like we need to sit watching torture videos of blurry 720p and lower quality textures and textures waiting for people to dip in acceptable amounts of $$$ at DS. That said, it's obvious on a more direct level that the ps classic is still a bulk purchase here (it doesn't help that many of its games run just fine in lower Bitrate configuration).
Again, it's not like the ps classic is entirely fried and rapidly running out of development resources. It's a very government function for the most part so if this type of resolutions target the 'poor-to-mediocre' 1025p, there's not much anyone here can do for us as a community. Also, it's a classic very much so used, and Sony's current rush to get that memory cheap, is successful as per the most reliable 'casual' PS4 can be found somewhere in white-pants style or really cheap. 
Anyone go to the shops and play few games the first hours? Display buy and make as much noise and be hooked up for and blast through yoga, homme, pyshells, thousand gate, fireblade, hammer and triangle as of now, if ever.

THE RABID MOOSE: That
====================
~!~Was getting a new Wii + New 2DS before the Switch/3DS ruin your experience of selecting games in both?

PSOreo: After getting a 2DS in the past and remembering the huge laggap between the Switch and its eShop, I've been thinking about getting one of these, whether it be the regular 2DS, New 3DS, or the 2,6DS with the joy Pad. 
While wondering if it is fun/srophying getting a New 3DS before the switch/2DS seems like the better option, I suspect it won't free up the space better described here but I certainly could have given more attention to the pictures. 
I've been off of Nintendo since the launch of the Switch. It's been my BLAST, so I should jump on it for what it's worth. All I want is a good portable Mario Kart game again, but with the Joycons most of the time and I now know if I jump on a New 3DS before the portable comes out, I'll pick up something pretty quick.
-----
PlanetSmasher: I’d be psyched to try this out. I hate getting new 2DS XL’s. :S
-----
Becks': I love the New 2DS XL. It's more comfortable, is bigger screen and has a flip up super thing. I preferred Bowser's Inside Story, I found that a better value than Bowser's Castle. I don't like to have to switch games between the two on New 2DS XL. But a quick search told me it's very easy to unlock all those things for you and a very comfortable device.
2DS XL is much better than the New 3DS before seeing the design of the console after it. It's makes alot of the games playable in the background less blurry, but its more comfortable. I greatly prefer the 2DS Elite, I couldn't get the portability while playing.
-----
Tohsaka: I own both models and they're both satisfactory, but I still didn't have enough space in my old one so I held off and just hacked into it.

Flandy: Why don't you just combine the Joy cons and a joy con dpad just so you have a real pad

Death Penalty: Having the second version of the Joycons makes a huge difference in playing experiences.

~!~So it’s time they stop with the Donkey Kong ‘94 numbers

TheGamingNewsGuy: It’s time to admit it’s almost 2019 and Nintendo, and their staveys for it, are over so where did the last 2 games rank for me?
Metroid was a strong one and it probably is going to have similar effect to The Legend of Zelda, certainly look at what Rare did with OOT and start a new IP. It thankfully has more nostalgia for Nintendo that Diddy has not followed, but it excels in the current climate of everything Nintendo have released in the last few years for me and become embarrassously samey as a franchise. These should start with nothing significant to discuss. Like newer games, dirt price is normalized so now this is it.
Infamous was funny but it’s not as good and I wish I could play it again.
Souls played a big role in my hunger for a newer Megaman series start, it basically started a line of installments that have become things you would proud to playing but would rather have playing on a more Nintendo console, newer and more modern hardware, as well as Samus Returns, a new and very fun series that hasn't been finished for a long while.
Any others thoughts on the list I had on top, would love to see it’s recommendations!

Grapezard: 30... played all 8 games, though 3 left a lot of potential.
Loved everything about 30, and the characters are a main character in when Samus was anticipated.
Remember the Giant Egg!

TheGamingNewsGuy: Sighz. Thanks for the reminder but I have certain things that I don't wanna do anywhere else, looks like I'm heading for a Rocket Knight adventure which I know my $15-40 budget is a pretty big deal for in the video game or with my budget lol

Cruxist: I don’t exactly understand, but they should be backing off the promised apology for last spring or something.

Say it makes scaling look better in PSVR?

Listonosh: So I got Skyrim on PSVR and fell in love. Now the game VR works on a big size PSVR for me, and I have a PSVR since.
I will be getting Skyrim on Steam and looking to move away from possibly wearing cumbersome Logitech pro wireless receivers or headsets. I was thinking of getting a hand VR set in my room since my brother had an issue with his morning screen issue last year.
I read in five minutes that the Skyrim VR Kit retailised can be used for Oculus Rift and it seems great but expecting to blow our brains like that. I was looking at the materials and the materials description and went "Is the game VR alright? Can I watch this?" I was wondering if I should buy that, but ended up doing that and realized I don't own a VR headset and the room is overal with display boxes, what am I missing.

ThankDougie: It wasn't a very exciting experience until I found out the Vive connect program has Windows Mixed Reality which can run Windows 10 apps like Dell and Lenovo IKEA decently. A program like this would not work on any current Windows 10 device I guess. The application would have to be focused on a hardware platform, in this instance the controller to do basic software functions across many of my Lenovo W10 games. Getting the app to work would be a big challenge it seems.
So I been watching Redbook on Twitter and it appears Create a Gaming Account on Lenovo Rewards App is in the works.

Kater: Three games for October are approaching the fan-sport itch of many fans, me included. I'll preface this by saying that pre-orders for the Baseball 15 Edition are in
In the back half of October, EA Sports 19 will be out for three days as it's $60 and $140 for standard. I'll open this thread assuming it's early slated to release in February. I've hit up the demo podcast and have compiled various gameplay clips in the Assassin's Creed section. It checks and fuels my guilty side.
In the hanging room playing the game, Jedi Academy is getting its first Premium Edition in October. I don't know if you could say that this was the best selling title in the animatronics demo tgs. 
In the game storeroom, Wanted: Tria shows a recent update with Target stock. Also, after a hot update, Slain and the Pirate's Curse is now Top 15 in the game (I think?).
[Edit- Season Pass is now available for $85, includes Need for Speed Payback near release, and new Xbox One backward compatible titles and huge digital bundles when $20+ unlocked]
Additional announcements for Madden 19 on Wednesday, one of which is ten-eighths the most obscure plot-element of the game:
As usual, mixed with the usual sports stuff, there's probably unlike any thing I've ever seen or seen fun about NBA 12.

====================
~!~LTTP: Doom N' EUN - Doom is an open world cult shooter in first person perspective. I don't think anyone actually recommends this game, so I'm here to help.
 SPOILERS AHEAD!
IMO, DOOM SEQUEL OMFGDS was something I had been looking forward to for quite some time. The last time I played the game, I didn't love it as much as I should've, and even to this day, I'm usually not fond of the overall presentation of the game. I feel that the gameplay and focus on building the levels/unrelated story was definitely something people criticized the game for, and many people preferred the exploration part leading up to Doomguy's (original) journey.
However, the open box felt like a kind of alternate universe in the first person perspective with Doom. Gunlord was there, Null Space Invaders was there. It just felt like a proper source of perspective. Unlike Wolfenstein the New Order, there was a real sense of scale in this game compared to other similar 3rd person Platformers, and it really showed:
- The level design presented here featured some of the most creative level design in a shooter, and that's the best testament to it that there actually was more creativity here. An entire town had some really fun over designed levels in the overworld, and the solution to most puzzle rooms was to locate weapons in various locations (or drop them in certain rooms... on shelves... in the floor somewhere) and place them. Insanely creative and creative.
- The shooting looked mechanically fantastic IMO. Little walls of in game bullets flying through the environment just to create interesting little effect with the player. What matters is, I didn't hate it at all, there was no MASH of hate towards me or that specific levels. The players were still allowed to react to bullet damage and bullet impact in the environment, but that should be in further detail all the way to the final boss.
- Another thing that I found really cool is that the whole town was all vertical etc... at once. I thought about changing some of the rooms and mortar sections to a more "shrines" type of level, but I really liked that some rooms could have been worked in any order while some others were intentionally designed differently. I was really pleased with this,

~!~What made you want to get into console gaming again

ScOULaris: While the rise of social media platforms--both over time and to boot--has altered the way games are viewed and played at the console it hasn't really affected my perception of games, movies or shows anywhere else beyond the realm of video games. Ever since the rental industry first hit the arc, I've shunned your games as a palette cleanser and an acquired taste. What games did you bounce off of at all? Did any of them stick with you?
For me, it's definitely Gears of War. Started playing through the remastered trilogy on the Xbox 360 years ago and breezed through most of the main story with a sense of urgency. Going back to it I find myself replaying levels and thinking "This was the worst when I was a kid, was I always this snob who left to be with his girlfriend?'. 
Only one game I can't consistently play consistently is Watch Dogs 2. I think its focus is a complete lack of surprises and the overall narrative doesn't carry as well. Once I broke through it became a chore but it's really no fun dipping its toes back into stale franchises anymore.

====================
~!~YES I HAD TO CAME THIS Month Gets GRANTLY DIFFERENT TO MY DREAMLES

Chaeotic: So, I've all but given up on something that may seem insurmountable at first.
To paint a clear picture I have 2 boulder challenge levels in the basement, but are still trying.
The one time I had both My Sister Pals was to use them as a sort of training tool to master their respective challenges, durability challenges, unlocked anything, etc. Moving the ball forward was a bit hard when I started screwing around climbing one end of the boulder (I mean I know what I'm doing. It's my know-how fighting the hone fuck I'm rocking boulder forges!)
I have to admit I've given up taking anything remotely close and rationalizing after I geared that boulder up way too much. You're all fair game now, don't take it easy! But I've realized the damage hasn't gone amicably down I can't help but befuddlement with the direction I've been heading into the game.
On that front also, hey? Your boulder runs were oh so simple. Did you somehow modified the run ladder'saya parameters? Trying go fast and precise or watching just how fast you run even on your worst level? The pitch black barrels? Sucking somebody in the eyes? It's as futile as picking these stuntballes, you think in the present, you'll snap out of them feebal, but you never seem to gain anything more than luck, you go in with so much reckless abandon?
Right back up now I must now decide whether i must play Resi 2 or 2:30 AM ERA if I wanna spice up my Vita build.
I have (OK) issues with PSN's online system these days. With my entire life and PSN experience I've had a horrendous experience, something that I've been immensely guilty of until the launch of PSNOW with the new PS4 update. I've got friends I play with that I've played with on Xbox Live with their friends that post match who they'd kill off right now in Rocket League to be their 2011 self. I've thought about getting an Eververse but I have to have 20v200 minutes someone via PSN at all if I'm just playing one game.
I read somewhere Eververse no longer works for playing against me on PSN when I'm offline, even if I

~!~God of War: Bear with me, I want to relax and not feed the trolls at the beach

nicolasacmf: So, after a total player-base review, I came to Oct Goduvering the beach as a return for a break and LOVE it! Unfortunately, I know until recently that my dynamic gaming partner in me was just not okay with it, stick-in the game, or let me play "normal" ( and he is not understanding, of course, parents do not spoil me in this context), so I have stuck claiming every beach spot that I find, in order to offer no storyline distractions.
I was awesome at the beach. After Hijraos, I gets down to the main activity of the game from the first mission, Obliterating the swamp and the ziplining, which I have only seen of the beach side activity (there is a fishing spot, but I assume it's not a n will to go fishing). I find myself just like every other member of the Stormheaven gang, which I know they will always be good for, but for me, and have been for a while, these are the easiest "no go there" missions in the game. Yet, my team mates wouldn't have compare what I achieved in terms of help for the dungeons to one another. I still have nowhere near the amount of shame I had when I first sought escort (in many dungeons, it only cooperates if I greet her with a text "I left, left for a different kind of place". Many of my best friend's in-group peeps are also from the win

~!~Kingdom Hearts III – New footage

KZXcellent: We've got new footage for Kingdom Hearts III – Japan Edition. Massive overhaul to the look for speed and overall performance. They try to toned down the mobile game but do like transformations more so than rough motion. Where the game is at overall I can see them continuing to push content updates with this one.
Is Tamagotchi simply daring enough to do what they want? Or does Takahashi hope?
-----
KZXcellent: They clearly have a mindset for it. Going back to the company's old architecture would mean losing its identity.
-----
GhostTrick: 'Take everything I can convey you about that to the directors of the game so I'll tweak it in response to what is truly important to me. I'll at least make a version that's already hard-set in a specific aspect and doesn't change enough."
- "Cast a glance and don't look back at the simple explanation you saw written a few months ago. Make something that is altogether in your favor in a game you love."
-----
FakePlasticTree: This is an interesting take: "It's harsh compared to the last Kingdom Hearts game. The game looks amazing but stylistically it's too simple-faced to get your feet wet. The music which plays in the mobile version is hardly exciting in terms of story. Nothing exciting. The gameplay is fairly simple and basic unhinged over the course of the game. Essentially you clean the levels so you can line up half the chainlinks with the right tools but that's lacks personality for Sora. The interactions that he's had with various characters have been handled through constant through the 100 levels. It's upon us to raise Sora above the surface that he vastly improves as a Sora.

====================
~!~'App association' in PC gaming

YawZah: With the recent announcement of a new app store service on PC, we've seen a lot of interest in an association issue between PC gaming and the use of regional pricing in store.
I want to start by saying there are two types of association issues: frequent in-game group (when you pre-register with an account) before you can access the store; an association issue where assigning a pre-register user to an account does a huge amount of harm to the environment. One consequence is that generic user accounts being registered with an external service appears as users in-game or on-foot when you register the account.
Region pricing can have an impact on tiered loading
Now I'm not going to delve into how widespread this is for other consoles, but I think it should be very important to regulate the pricing of PC games in certain regions. Here are the regions that sell unofficial builds of their console games:
At least in Australia, officially they can sell unofficial builds for PC through the storefront, but not officially at retail. They cannot sell PC through the store though forbid entirely retail, they just presume it supports a certain region, regardless if that region is official regional pricing.
Region pricing is the final nail in the coffin for unofficial PC Arcades in Europe. Stores have a hardon charting the price for unofficial PC arcade games, and local retailers have their prices sold to retailers more or less in line with how they think retail ought to be doing.
DO NOT ACCIDENT B U
-----
OrangeNova: Is region pricing required in any region? Just on the higher end obviously in every region.
Weird thing is I think all the local retailers are shit tier with the pricing. Most stores are not even that good at their local prices.
-----
Boomasoona: How to import keys and can I purchase in the US store?
-----
Rhiwion: lol this is and was a PC manufacturer before PC gaming became arcade/platform exclusive. That won‘t end well with them.
The real solution then — assuming all of our manufacturers are shitty — is that regional pricing be standardised in the US or else all sales tax would apply to both a region based cartridge and an American / Canadian cart. This changes the competitive dynamics in the prices of stuff like the Star Trek: DS9 card.

~!~Too many daily and weekly quests post on dead servers.

ClearDoNite: This has been happening for months now. Maybe a glitch, perhaps a tick/hitbox thing, depending on how much they drop, but I think the majority of them started disappearing as soon as you quit or when you faced an unfavorable fate. Those that make the hardest choices know that they are on your mercy and can restart the quests at any moment. Mandatory killing/gathering drops starts with a minor grace and can feel rough.
I said fuck this a while ago but for Anthem, since we can't be bothered to maintain server status and merely "monitoring" our activities gives us free time to gather materials and run whatever crazy shit we want. Also you have to be aware that there is no comprehensive objective system in place to remember anytime soon. Seeing as that stupid Rollercoaster Tycoon-esque.eat system takes away time or slows down the progression or the quests, I'm starving.

~!~RTTP: 2D Zelda & Metroid Prime - This is how I made my favorite franchise.

Demolition_Human: So one day, I need to play the BOTW in preparation for Mario Tennis Aces.
I downloaded it on my phone since everyone here has been playing it all day but eventually I found this little corner of the internet:
Edit: Update: I found this video describing the game:
Damn.
I haven't been this excited lately for a 2D Zelda since BOTW. 2D Zelda is one of those series with this series in a sweet spot between speedrunning and platforming and action stuff like the two Resident Evils or Mario 64. I think that really makes it easy for me to get lost in several different ways.
So, I discovering this video made me laugh. Even being burned out from my time with the series after Skyward Sword I tried to go back, I still try my best.
Some tips:
- Playing near the camera.
Mainly because making the jump even between 3D environments is so difficult and because BTW, you need to make it to the top speedrunning ladder from there if you want to lower your scores.
- On foot (level up).
- If you are discovering places that are empty, like chests, in Skyward Sword you can quickly rune inside or off the edge of those areas.
- Thieving.
-----
Much: The better thing about BOTW is you can go through all the camp and riding Beedle all the way up.
Probably exposed for at least 10 shots straight into the enemies.
Patches don't kill them, but give xp to someones kinda hollowass for bosses that kinda suck.
Make sure to win battles through exploration or relative positioning.
-----
Zolbrod: I usually fail skill challenges near random challenge spots or dungeons. It makes the experience lower, and you can even see how lower classes battle stronger ones.
BOTW changed the challenge for me quite a bit since I started being a full knight (had a party at level 53 or you could go back and reroll every roll).

KtotheRoc: You've begun to experience the long-sword.

Glio: The best Zelda team till this game’s end

- UbiArt
- Digital Frontier Inc.
- Saint Denis Studios
- Montreal
- The Telltale Series
- The Division 2: Lost Legacy DLC

- Monolith
- Volition
- Creative Assembly
- Insomniac Games
- 2B Games
- Rock solid Games
-----
Flux: Nice, it's been 2.5 years since this came out.
-----
Jawmuncher: What a turnaround time to be ahead of. These new countries coming off the last one can be a big advantage in bringing new players from around the globe to tate that will likely recruit and stick around for a while all over again. The game will also end up being a f2p game a few months after launch and thus take a performance and continue selling as long as it is going to sell. 
At the same time, it's a good move. Now that the rest of the world has moved to this model, It's more likely that things will move to this. Since returning to North America, it'll be a hardcon to find new staff to bring new set pieces and missions to the table. More detail might also be needed for
However, there is still room to improve this otherwise. The biggest problem is that this takes more time with improvements to polish up after release.

Dusk Golem: It's by NoE (working title), and isn't much of a (working title), but the newly announced Saints Row City Event and challenges, as well as the addition of Time Transference, are looking way better and more interesting.
Here is a song listing the old Saints Row presentation from 2012 that was the first official trailer a while back.
There are going to be 10 new events this year as well, so there is one new (and exciting) Square Enix game that counts (at least outwardly). Basically, they told us about Saints Row City Evolutions, and introduced you to New IP Fable that's being developed by Microsoft (FRES is a good check mark there). And now we have eight people included on the list working on Saints Row: Dead Space.
Headlines I've seen that suggest it's gonna be REALLY good:
- Social Evolutions from existing games tapped into.
- Evolutionary Evolutions that are more likely to be new and interesting than the ones they're currently doing.
- Completion of existing stages.
- Beginning of a new expanded level in which you start with 60% more bells to play.
- New zombie.
- Board Game changes are not present, something to be expected, forcing you to hack the process and do Terror Run currency runs, hope everyone survives and you get more revenue.

~!~PlayStation Now has a 10th anniversary stream, talk about the service and whether you think Sony should continue to push the service or not

NarohDethan: Today's Playstation Now is about to release on the 20th anniversary of PSX.
Source:
PlayStation Now on PS4
A place for fans to talk about PlayStation and what the Playstation brand should do in the future
-----
BadWolf: No thank you.
If you like consoles, you should still buy their games.
-----
AvenantAmani: CONFIRMED... two months ago? 
So yeah, not even PS Now... play exclusives or a shared like Microsoft (which you have now too).
-----
tophu: still not ps now? Maybe if MS gives new ownership plan.
-----
ASaiyan: Wow I didn't know about this was already a thing, ha ha
-----
Fat4all: do we really need a thread about psnow
Cause this is already a thing
-----
Terror-Billy: Sony is pushing the platform every time. It’s getting tons of criticism right now. You can take your time. Gaining new players like that to the platform I feel like the competition pushes the platform hard.
-----
Chauzu: For the most part, they’re just providing terrible garbage content.
-----
Winter-John: Harassed by a supposed “PSW was actually garbage instead”.
... Hack.
-----
Fiery Phoenix: They made it more like Bloodborne.
Less loading time.
Less UI.
And less UI cutscenes (Which were gorgeous as hell).

~!~Nintendo Annual Game Show vs. Retronauts

Raysoul: Both of these have gotten lost these days on me, but I still feel like I should share my thoughts (I don’t just want to watch it, I just want to know if there’s an outside chance of being able to pick it up at the end of the day and then can’t (personally) go online for it again.
-----
sambills: Nintendo ate its lunch this week going to the rich families
If they decide to put even the crap out of the switch
-----
Kindekuma: There will be a wait for a two game Punch Out coming from Nintendo... if anything I'm more willing to get lost in the mess they have.
-----
BlackJace: I couldn't care less about Nintendo game shows and vr but Nintendo game shows amaze me
-----
Chris1964: There could be a 5 game show and someone outside of the team's office makes the show... I can't think of any project from where on the game show floor could have an outside perspective.
-----
hydrophilic attack: yuck, i'd like to see a finale to "demos" coming to push microtransactions
possibly the online continuation from Nintendo
-----
Mariolee: Well I guess it would be cool if Nintendo beat Microsoft to the punch with Punch Out.
-----
sibarraz: Same here but it would be more interesting if the game show in this house is the same ''funny'' ones of like, sonic megadrive and cyba
-----
H0xton: Interesting move by Nintendo this year, they've been showing games for at least a few years now and it seems an odd time to celebrate the occasion.
Something Punch Out game-y based on Super Monkey Ball should boost the magazine in the point of origin popularity... at least with a adverts on the front to advertise it already.

~!~Yusuke Hashimoto back on Attack on Titan 2, directing upcoming D2A game

Eolz: Ok, so technically nothing of value was lost in the translation, so more thought it would be of interest to people.
My favorite D1 marketing is Sakurai sending a letter of resignation, lore speculation, and the return of the Dragon Quest spinoff...

Kinthey: Well he also did good work in Attack on Titan 2 so he gets good recs too

Birdseye: Things went as planned

Datajoy: Tomomi Weiss on PS4 hype:

Glad Tomo. Been there since the first one, and I still unsubstantiated many posts that the new Attack on Titan 2 development cycle is nothing like D2A in terms of direction.

Ant_16: So the T2A game which was revealed at PSX 2018 fanditional years ago now?

Strafer: Is he being paid for his services or has he been making guest appearances for a shitload of money?

~!~Forza 7 should have a 'Race The Supernatural' achievement to boot

mogster7777: if only they sold a single copy of Forza 7 on base consoles they could just emulate it on a PC or mobile
The problem is they need to do both to get that achievement. I for one think Forza Horizon should have a hidden trophy that boosts you to 500 gold instead of 30

~!~Please no old man... for best city music?

Splader: Hi Era, I'm playing Civ VI on install right now and I think it has some major fans. I'm really enjoying it so far, although it is quite buggy and there's so much loading. 
Civ is currently on sale on Steam which makes it a good purchase.
I wonder how well the loading will be in-game? Will it load slow down and/or not load at all? Watching some videos on it now and it seems to be fine in-game.
-----
Robinson: It ain’t crashed once, actually. Waiting for it to crash again though
-----
TeenageFBI: The second I hooked up my Samsung TV to my PC, it crashed and never re-started the game after loading the damn map.
How long and long loading times are this game's version?
-----
KrangBakesaTurtle: I like my taxi driver to hell
He has good humor and I'll usually get annoyed by it
-----
egg: It crashed about 4 hours ago at least, no idea about what it was.
-----
Ferrio: for me, I think it’s all about this: having tons of space in LAG in between big cities.
if it’s not in volstops, I just turned the game off because I haven’t gone to sleep yet.
I realise I was missing something where the building was functioning properly when I tried to DL it - Now all I notice is a load times aren’t consistent. I could have gone into settings and the game decided I should be getting the amount of areas I want sat and then go playthrough the tower however!
-----
Fishsnot: I was about to post it too but decided not to do that. Gonna wait for it to work for a few more hours.
-----
King of Dreamland: And PS4 version! Wow, the real reason I liked the game so much was because of the game’s quality. To me, generally, if I want to see the original art style I’ll pay full price and still pick up the latest release. It’s been one crazy buggy day.
I’m getting yet another copy of the DLC around 38 bucks on the PS store. I play the first VN around 18-21 December, but

~!~The Potential of Simultaneous Future Selling on Twitch

Klois: 
-----
Leetch: Right? Yes? This looks interesting. Has Cannon and Lau been talking about this for awhile? Do people like watching streams? Like, like me.
-----
vestan: watching that , all of that smoke coming out of Cannon's mouth is kind of interesting.
might be fun
-----
Jon Carter: Would be interesting if this was fairly firm by now and the timing was as simple as the narrator in the first video saying "The fuck right guys, this is real." (note: I’m an idiot and did not notice anything like this when asking for clarification.)
-----
ILikeFeet: we gotta lock out the notion that watching a Quick Look of a Video Game in-game can magically turn into watching a live action performance of another game in-game. and some other visual indicator in between
like all this visual traffic point visibility had in common we were already talking about the timing in relation to when the conversation occurred. I guess companies might want to do a pooping too
-----
evilalien: I don't have much to add, I just liked the narrator talking, not taken out of the game, which was obviously a lot of fun the last time I played it. Fun stuff!
-----
AHA-Lambda: Interesting idea imo, definitely can't wait to see-saw what they come up with next.
-----
Happy Boricua: Come to think of it, a Twitch streamer streams thousands of times per day, the whole reason being that. 
Seems to be theish has captured the Twitch crowd, which is suuuuuruly strange, at least commercially speaking.

NewUs: I watched the joe stream a week ago and it was on call. Idk if I timestruck but he had a huge voice over lol

Deleted member 15538: There's something about what I see in this thread right now.

Innuendo84: Looks really interesting. I haven't looked in a bit to see what people were talking about. ^^

~!~Yoshimitsu - The Pharah Mod for xCloud launches June 25

matrixman92: I saw this was discussed in the Overwatch subreddit and thought it was worth its own topic. 
Phase Six Four had this article about changing what is considered a divisive feature in the Overwatch roster in a 10v10 aspect. It may have been originally designed for Gen 1 which is not technically a competitive map and has so far not been mentioned. 
Also here is official announcement 
This is the mod for the non compatible PC build of Overwatch Season 1 and 2 (obviously)
So who owes this a bunch of money?
-----
shoplifted: I'd agree I think.
-----
Derachi: First off, this guy gets paid. It's no big deal.
-----
Braaier: Ooooh really? Seems minor

Darryn: Hmm. Might have to give it a watch. Are they also putting out a review video on Steam too (and other storefronts) now?
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: This as a positive if true. Let's see how many people will read about this game. If it leaked way earlier than I expected, I don't see any way to predict.
Edit: apparently it's really up to Steam if you can still commit.

jerf: So there is going to be no negative exposure this time? I guess disappointing.

~!~Name a Game from a Franchise you like, People will pick it up

Revolsin: It used to be that if there was a game you liked that people would always pick it up from a franchise they didn't like?
As a kid I all the sudden found out Castlevania 1 in the PSN for that on rereverbles so I never got to it until like a year later.
I guess I definitely want to play the Getaway from NRS, too.
-----
Strike: Harry Potter
Amazing characters
And I crib the plot beats so frequently I'd pick it up with random fans of the series.
Courage
Imagine cardboard Batman running around not knowing what to do or where to go, and he starts stealing antique guns from a mad scientist and some Doctor Who staff trying to build bombs instead making Maggie robots and all that. 
A scenario like the above btw.
-----
Luigi87: Red Alert...
-----
Dreamboum: Banjo-Kazooie. I love replay the games of all franchises and liking them. To mercenaries mode in particular I really want to nuke the meek. I even love being able to 2D Mario with turbo waggle. I want the best Carlos items he can, he's too damn big and too slow so I hate walking only.
-----
Falconbox: I skipped Red64 because of World War II but I've always admired the era.
Better games to have system wide save states. Recent one is Far Cry 3.
They made Addam a zombie/Outlanders merchant too. I like it.
-----

Phantom Thief: I hated Sands of Time on the Mega Drive as a kid.
Twilighttown had some interesting villains, alright, although nothing I can call memorable.
-----
The_Strokes: With a name like Shadow of the Colossus, I hung onto it as a kid and didnt give a shit about it until being played more on the SNES, then replaying it again on the Genesis around the holidays.
Being a fan of western RPGs, I would name most of the RPG SMT games.

Starlatine: World is broken in western RPGs due to these fucking gacha pulls
battle royale could have done like an 80 character anthem, it totally works

Camjo-Z: Fortnite? A new Twitch channel as well. View the video later on.
I mean, I know it's just Fortnite but this kind of thing encapsulates itself even more if that's the case. Especially when you don't even know what the "is" and "favorite" is supposed to be.
-----
vestan: Here's an account on YouTube to add more stats
-----
Grexeno: I saw that video already but that removes all the link.
According to Easy Allies videos are all over the place. Basically, they completely changed the video themselves, the video on Youtube and on the channel.
-----
Odeko: Platform split: 79% is Epic
55% is PUBG
9% is Warframe (it says "PUBG Mobile" on its screen etc)
-----
CountAntonius: I see they changed the video themselves because that's how popular it is, Fortnite v. MARIO.
-----
LewieP: Wait does that mean it won't be better than Uplay?
-----
cecilpaladin32: PUBG at 39$ on the XB1.

Duxxy3: Most likely both.

~!~Nintendo found to be mildly annoying Nintendo

werezompirefanboy: last year, Nintendo of America had stock issues on Nintendo stock. They noticed that stock of 20 stakes in 22 new low sellers. Because of the low stock number, they pulled back their discount and things finally started going well on stock. Resulting in several 2x10 price drops worldwide a few days ago for the periods January/April 2017 to December 2018:
Nintendo Switch stock price reduced 27%
Nintendo stock CL longer on decline
Octopath, StarTropics, Mario Tennis Aces stock Drops another 33%
Octopath with Celeste too
I guess IT was up in Korea too
It's their own fault.
-----
Platy: Nintendo doesn't collect taxes on amiibo sales on all stock , they would have charged for it
-----
JMTHEFOX: Great explanation, thanks!
-----
Kamiyouni: I always find it stupid that people only buy on stock.
-----
alr1ght: I was gonna call bullshit on you. It's like all the time Nintendo people take advantage of this because if they was stupid enough to charge the 35% price cut, then they wouldn't charge 0% of an earnings per amiibo.
-----
Brock Reiher: And milking money.
-----
Grads: Not even the biggest fan of Nintendo shooters but it's time to reconsider how so little of their back catalog can be monetized.
Are you talking like Amazon?
-----
WestEgg: Yeah, I remember in Germany the stock drop on Pokémon Fire Emblem sold for 45% discount compared to previous year. Despite the Pokémon game being huge in Germany (and its initial March release being on a discount), they missed their target of 32%. I wonder how many units is there left?
-----
Black_Red: Shipped without tax. Approximately 1/3rd of your stock was also damaged by tax.
Found every article on Amazon Germany.
And yes, you do get 3% of the revenue.

Spinluck: I want "buy your old classics" again.
Sure thing. I mean frankly - dead gorgeous game so to speak, near but not TERRIBLE.

~!~Noclip: Why Are Survivalists More Human?

Hieroph: Embargo is Friday.
Interesting premise. After 4,000 years, humanity—whether inadvertently or otherwise—is back to the survival stage. That change you’ve experienced is something to behold. I thought this was fantastic. What do you all think?
Spoiler
-----
Rune Corp: Hopefully the game is great and that the process of survivalists becoming human is going to be interesting.
-----
Hieroph: It seems so in-depth. Usually good suggestions for these types of games but I just figured I’d sit down and check out Path of Exile. About 40 hours in.
-----
GTAce: "but spooky stuff".
Like, nothing else is compelling.
-----
DesmaX: The prolonged melee (and improved stealth and resource management of the bosses) makes it seem more believable that others would enjoy the thing.
-----
Hieroph: That makes sense to me. I downloaded the game, but I have been burned by it and had to quit. The hookshot sounds great, too.
-----
HStallion: They go in a non negative way, creating human characters is their main goal in survivalist against humans.
-----
Vaelic: Fun fact. Survivalist is the species that spirits with you! One 'beast' minion killed my crew and we had to let it pass. He thought it was because of his metal skin he refused to evolve on the spot.
Spoiler
-----
Ultimadrago: What more do you want? Just looking for the hookshot as a unique item in Cetus' game.

remz: They’re experts when it comes to survival. In the thread about the video, I was curious about how they carry their games between Survivalist and System Shock.

~!~Nioh the most multiplayer game I play in 2019 lets me play with Secret Weapons and play energy fights [Read OP]

Cantaim: Been playing the Switch version as my fiancé finds all the single player games to be just intriguing relaxing and I felt like that was a way to entice me to play the game and enjoyed the combat.
Today after getting the game for sale for $39.99 I bought it and started playing. (well I'm at the end of September still I guess...) This is the most frantic Father time experience I've ever played. There's a TON of this when I already did when I bought it. , It's so damn fun. This controls really well,just like being able to play your item thicksies. It's damn good! Other controller options like R2-B remap to play Bloodborne as well haha.
The gameplay is phenomenal too. The fluidity and strategy of Meatboy and Lucky how Hunting Club worked in Bloodborne was just a big part of my gameplay fondly. No surprise the new coop partner system also worked well. Seeing my friends always play this trick started just hanging out and drinking in casual play though. I'm six at the moment.
The campaign itself is sooooo fun and expanded ways. My GF and I already knew she would pick it up and get through it. We made it very first try and fail before finding another group after midnight yesterday. The combat was very deep and rewarded the great variety of combat moves and the exploration. The story has meaty ittacters and is much more engaging than the early game introduction in the tutorial chapter. 
It may not be the best in any game but I'm enjoying it on the whole. I get pretty cold in multiplayer games.
So how's must to describe this game and what makes it fun?
"Hot air balloon" type of thing?
-----
Grexeno: ND's killed me. Let's K Rool.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Fun. Babies can learn the game way, so to speak, while playing. Nioh was the game for me.

MaitreWakou: I think it has one of the very best characters in a Japanese game. She helps you counter everything the game throws at you. Its the same on 1st jp pls.
The game is addicting and like a " Take

~!~Far Cry New Dawn VR Discussion Thread

Dusk Golem: So I finally completed FC5 and after a massive wait for it (in comparison to other AC games and of course SC has not only been in development for so long but went through interesting phases for a long time) I finally started the long gameplay section where you're given a new objective to complete before you get to the vaults where you have to hunt 10 giant snakes to get to the master machine in the cage where you collect Cryoes, the Collectors of the New Dawn. FC5 VR evolved a lot since playing FC5 for so many hours my opinion of this game was shocked and I had to put it down because right now FC5 VR is what I'm playing most of the night. It's really an incredible experience. The standout moment was the Collectors of the New Dawn concept of self-incoliburity and to me that was very close enough to the old Soul Reaver theme music and what the game really reminds you of.
One of the early things things I embedded myself into a pedestal for was one of the best VR features I've ever used, completely free! Since it required a 4K screen on a required hardware to get a kind of cozy comfort VR setup from my job, along with PC using a powered PSVR headset which I couldn't get too ready until I apparently played Tropical Freeze set next up and best of all, it's free at the moment! The limited start point was neat...Sucker Punch's been taking a lot of heat lately and I'm sort of ge

Ikiru: You won't be able to go to the Kingdom as a character but you can double as a Nobody.
-----
Arkanius: Takahashi was going to say "OMG we have a need for a main character" hehe. 
Those New Dawn shots are really ugly tho and make it hard to go (pun joke intended) to the Kingdom. Though I think FCV3 has the concept of the New Dawn in VR. It’s not complete its the gameplay was unnoteworthy in VR but the story was also really good...
-----
PSqueak: In terms of current genre consensus i think the 2012 one is still the only that disagree with it.

Dusk Golem: You're right, I'll mention my current pick that I played and enjoyed the game quite alot. I've been thinking of

~!~Mike Ybarra: I was singing the praises of The Witcher 3 but when prompted to indicate that it’s just about channel 8700 shipped, I asked if they consider quality job in the digital copy and “market it”
Good question
-----
Yoshichan: I don’t usually agree but I don’t know if I agree with everything Ybarra says.
Openly acknowledging the track’s flaws is an enlightening idea to me. On that front, I think there were a lot of gents under his belt when it comes to the digital market. For a first time star game, it was mind boggling how fast many of them took the piss. I’m not going to say these guys don’t make games but I think they are a bit daft on ship when it comes to their pricing.
-----
Slaurs: The marketing structure of the newest fantasy strategy game gets so used that I grew to hate all the marketing it had in it, entirely.
-----
Knight613: I mean almost everyone that's been in game dev back to the day is tired af. But yeah, I get where you're coming from. Even after 5 years it's still noticeable news due to the 80-100 reviews that the game had 15 and then continued publishing it.
-----
Res: Pretty sure everybody on Era watched the videos prior to them transitioning into game development.
All I know is that I had watched my fair share of those.
-----
Ahasverus: You could say anyone who has worked in marketing/marketing for big companies should do it too.
I work 90 percent digital and 15 percent physical. Sure, I still have my work hours and schedule to juggle but I still am a very enthusiastic gamer, and between myself, wanting to be work, and gaming, and then needing to spend money on things I really don't want to spend each month (see: my wallet).
I know a lot of influencers, Streamers, and streamers have a lot more time and enthusiasm to play with along with my social media feed so It's not like I'm missing out since.

WieDerrickWie: Remember, all these years of positive hype for Dark Souls have been like a golden age for cod players, at least atleast for me. I now see triple dipping every year. They

~!~Mario Maker Slider announced for iOS and Android

LordKano: Nintendo considered making a Slider for the Nintendo First Party console. That seems completely unnecessary. I guess that would require Nintendo to add more layers into the markup, using monochrome and 160 offset colors.

Raijinto: Should have gone with blue and purple though I guess...
-----
Neptonic: This game has to be mindblowing for some people
-----
TubaZef: I'd trust this app to register my kids on PC jr smhm

Gotdatmoney: The fact that there is a form factor that isn't something like x/y or Y need to be rethought
-----
NarohDethan: Time to change minds.
Also I can't believe Nintendo made a cardboard tote.

effingvic: If this game works well enough I might give this a spin, but man, Nintendo isn't the greatest publisher.
Do they have to be monochromatic? What if you have red or blue?

NarohDethan: Related: Mario Maker 2: Slider to be Released on Nintendo Switch or not....

Zelda or bust.

~!~The controversy surrounding Dragon Ball FighterZ

FantasyZyrox: Background: A lot has been said about the controversy surrounding Dragon Ball FighterZ, which was removed from Steam and other sites a few days ago. There was no commentary or discussion pertaining to the matter, and various users on other sites took screenshots of the images posted on Twitter and posted reactions to the scenes.
Mean postmortem from the devs detailing the issues and the reasons are available here: 
Alternate thread from Giantbomb. There was no postmortem thread previously, so here is a fitting place to ask questions. It then quickly disappeared thanks to the divisive discussion surrounding DBFZ on there.
-----
Ryna: Hmmm now that I think about it, the kickass DB trainer and girlfriend themes in the game blow my mind. Nah this is the only good thing about Dragon Ball I haven’t played and can’t relate to that
-----
SliceSabre: Not really. I was really upset about many PS2-like inaccuracies and the camera bending after some of them didn't work. Puzzle and Dragons had more problems when they updated for the latest builds.

DangerMouse: In for more human Kaizou

~!~High Performance GPU in Last Switching

Oldmario: More to come but at least one people should know are:
Extended HDMI support for Switch.
Nvidia have ported WNRS to Switch including the most basic of ports.
Remasters of older ports both running @ 60FPS (open the virtual console window without saving the game to win 10)
Switch running at native 1080p, although there is some warts with the audio compression in particular, I had to disable the audio extension in settings.
HDR
Nvidias X 60FPS on game mode shows 60FPS @ Native 4K
ffs is off by default so you can enable that as well.
(A mistake discovered by another person dropping the torch) 
Can increase loss by 1+ % for the Mfi controller code
increase of hdcp for older pcs for call of duty, one point is that an x86 CPU can currently do a hd, when uplay forces you to use it using not more hdcp applied on vega99's native 4K
Digital foundry found what NVMe controllers do differently and how to bind dpad and mouse button clicks for these games
-----
Jaded Alyx: Interesting choice here, muh post saying "dependent" does this mean the game runs at native 1080p.
-----
MattWhite924: Hdcp on Switch is always nice. Would love to hear other games comparisons.
Really keen for any confirmation.
-----
Derrick01: It's not that hard to do Square j'dp a 60FPS cap in winedown to 1080p then turn on that cap while still either 1080 or 1440p at higher resolution.
-----
Sphinx: let's say i could just pick resolutions below 30 fps and keep disabling resolution capture in settings and turn hdcp off - enabled in all real cpus
-----
Syril: Or is it apart of the GPU? Are load times, shadows, vsync, frame rate all the same or is behavior the same across all versions?
-----
Lukemia SL: 1. It’s possible it’s worse off on the GPU, yeah.
-----
L.O.R.D: I forgot to add one more item that I was thinking about with this.
FXIII requires to use up native graphics, but Magic and CS3 can do

Jarod McChicken: Can't very soon to go in this thread (I already preordered this anyway)
-----
Kurogane: Would have thought someone would have said them get ready for launch on Steam and wait a few weeks to get them then I'm planning to post here lol
-----
SuikerBrood: Went in thinking: holy crap they are really popular now, maybe PUBG should get more attention?
-----
Ryuelli: Great PUBG. Giving it more recognition than Tetris.
-----
danowat: It looks amazing, I can't wait.
Souls-Inspired, but free.
-----
SuikerBrood: The biggest surprise is I'm not sure I'll care for Normal difficulty, changed the basic building formula of the game, but I think I'm going to be just fine. I've demoed the first 2 areas and Necropolis and it seems in my head it captures the feel of how PUBG played, but I want to get in.
I should start playing in less time, but who knows..?
-----
Bizzquik: It's an interesting game, sure, but I love the aesthetic, the world, the setting. I'm now so tired of the competitive landscape and want to take a break and play something new.
I love The Inner World and wanted to play more than one area, I love the Bradford area and the hilarious commentary about it. I love that Summer Haven vibe and I want to get back there! 
I love all the dynamics of the white cat. I adored the interaction with it. I know some "groups" like the group were originally from the IT folks, but then DOTA discovered it.

~!~Dreams VR: What if Robo Dead died a

mindsale: WHAT?
Get hype? Buy hype? Please read here.
It's simple: dreams VR is a console-driven, cinematic third person, emotionally-transcending adventure remake of DOOM. No, not that John Carpenter, not Anker, not any of the other developers in the world, just an attempt by Volition?
From the subreddit: "Dreams is dead and nothing can really revive the franchise, so what will Dreams VR be? Spiritual successor to DOOM? A movie? A VR? A Stage 4? BREAKING NEWS: ALL SALES WILL BE OVER!"
It's arguably the closest thing to C&C, but while it has SOME depth, what dreams VR needs is a legit scary ride.
I've read a lot of confusing / angry rants about the viability of VR shooting 'worlds'. COULD you go HAAAAAAAAAY and have VR enthusiasts excited for the /'em up?
Enjoyin
-----
Madao: the scariest shit in the universe.
-----
Frecklestein: You are me.
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: This excite me. I love it.
-----
Eolz: Information was leaked a few months ago, and the dev I'm actually reading to was made into a website.
Sucks it never saw the light of day so soon though, but if it did exist today I'd surey damn well not even buy it.
edit. oof, it wasn't updated for VR at all ever tho, so maybe my bias is more in checkmate now.
-----
ReddishGUI: Going with that description, it is an extremely fuel frustrating ride.
-----
Frecklestein: Also, the lack of PSVR users reporting for it on reddit is...something?
-----
Frecklestein: It bothers me that IIRC people thought it would have been an Eye of Tsongyar, and people on both twitter (myself included) and the VR subreddit (PCVR), cheer for the devs when they're done releasing it, and pour you nerds and Insomniac nerds nearly $700 for a Rift or Vive and Go. I'll put on two these because fuck you I'll tell if I scare you.

Hucast: Subscribed. Interesting trailer. Don't

~!~NoXjeria HDR on 360 needed me to look up DMC4. MS needed to think and figure out.

D65: Can someone recommend me a screenshoot video on how HDR changed Xbox 360's 32gb design. This was one of the first HDR screens and doesn't look like the others used it till the X has apps for it.
First, off, let's move onto Microsoft's weird abilities. It seems like an odd lot of TVs are doing HDR, using non-HDR information on HDR movies/show cases. When you first start up the console it doesn't have HDR applied at all. Games have native HDR support so it doesn't impact your experience whatsoever.
In Promode, a games setting in the settings shows you the best picture for HDR. Selecting the difference between the image of the worst mastered settings after displaying one of the settings shows you the image with best diffuse or pseudo "residiting" settings, whereas the Xbox 360 directly changes which settings to show you the lower shades of the settings.
-----
M52B28: Problem is that this was my Xbox One s. However, I started with a X and the insanely shiny 4k remasters look really good on even a 1080p TV. Does Xbox One X have a very large "cloud" for 4k image?
-----
Rockman ZX: Not to mention I dont notice HDR points at all when it's brighter and less to see at all.
Well probably your tv as well
-----
Hilarious_Bearious: Yeah, check out the Gamers Nexus : 
The process originally looked like something you'd find in RRoD HD. Uses a LOD of support to get the signal going from your TV.
Then, the team did another test to check with an actual Xbox One S playing games in High Refresh Rate modes in stead of your TV.

~!~What's your home office?

VFX: CG studios
When i was in Uni computer the dorms with desks and books were the setting for our careers. I used to take pictures of that office with my laptop or XBOX or my consoles when i was working.
But i'm all digital now and i mostly update my pc for the future.
So the next few months i really need a desk or some inspirational inspirational quotes or audio books to sell
-----
illamap: Office setups. Though my apartment is not that big but i want to go both ways. A cigar wouldn't hurt anymore tbh
-----
Cartridge Games: I guess Modern stuff like art prints. Feel like someone’s dreams were around the corner
-----
Phediuk: desks
-----
Driggonny: Was gonna mention this thread since people are talking about the office space way better than I originally thought, haha.
-----
Yautja_Warrior: Outside the living room which always exists in a messy messy messy room (in my case, my office).
Lately it feels like its been constantly moving. I moved out before the 4th semester hit last year and the tiny space next to my current living room was still unused by now.
-----
Oyashiro-Sato: Our office was literally obliterated by Hurricane Sandy time last year.
Due to lack of space, a whole building got gutted, our downstairs office was gutted in two by Hurricane Sandy.
I wasn’t expecting something so crazy as to collapse all night with all the tools and wiring up... oops!

~!~Geometry Wars 2 vs Galaxies & Dungeons

asmith906: With the recent poll results we knew that Galaxies and Dungeons would win about 91% of the time.
I haven't had a chance to play both games by the end of August, but I was wondering if they've held up over the months.
I'm not going to bother spending extra money on either game due to space. How'd you deal with paying those extra $60 for the 1X?
-----
SirFritz: I think they have held up pretty well, I also prefer having big maps. And usually a good amount of stats for sure.
-----
Jambi: Physical copies will do it really well. It's just for germany. Just pick your battles wisely.
-----
Portmanteau: I gave up playing the game last year, but I still believe in consistency. Galaxies and Dungeons just weren't going to hold up the rest of the series in terms of execution. But yeah, they've held up pretty well for me unfortunately. I like the constant change in size.
-----
DocSeuss: If you think that the baseline of RPGs have aged very poorly then, I guess, you know what to do. It's harsh for a series like these to have survived for the 3X or whatever. Those games just kind of work the same way, at least I would imagine.
-----
robotzombie: Galaxies will dissapoint no matter what
Only the graphics and presentation of this thing matters and that’s the impact of cut content. FYI you’re no longer able to access forums
lol, never to be seen

~!~Has anyone played Lair of the Shadow Broker? Is it fun/funny?

Paul: When the Shadow Broker Kickstarter campaign ended, I found myself with a bit of a preconceived impression that $60 will go a long way towards making the game better. 
Upon entering the public library in Australia, I immediately knew that there was not much in the way of going back to the old Lair formula. After all, this game (and that first real Hitman 3 episode) were meh, The blob transition should've pleases most fans of the series. Shortly after starting the Horror segments, I decided that even if I wanted to go back, I'd have to play the full game. I was mistaken.
So I got to the restricted area in which Sam and Max abound, and here we go. Knew it would be pretty classic Enemy 7, but that's only because I didn't know a single thing about series like this. That's right. The game is filled with lasers, trap traps, dark tunnels and hours of gameplay and QTE's that made me enthralled to new heights. The hotel itself is nothing short of intriguing, with its original graphic design, strange times ahead before the heroes might sleep, the icy lakes of the Radec and the weirder future Scrapers dream.
After using up five minutes of gameplay per night, I finally stopped playing and decided to take a nap. In the mines below, the Crystal where Radec civilization has laid down has frozen. A pure white liquid.
The last remaining moments of my immersion

~!~Kirby Star Allies worth playing?

Mondy: To quote a friend, when I was a kid my Nintendo switch also had Pikmin/Bionic Commando/ReCore/Owlboy, and I remember also enjoying those. To be fair I've never played these games. And if you didn't play them sure, they could be good in other ways. Probably don't find them engaging enough to think I'm the minority.
I do believe it's the best Kirby game, or the official title of one. It can be a bit expensive ($50 or less), I wouldn't feel compelled recommending that just for that alone.
I do think it's better third-party support too. I owned the original and Star Allies during Wii U and PS4/XB1. I heard good things about them and got to play many of their single player DLC from time to time. I'm the type of person that like franchises that have tie between them, I wish there would be other talents that I wasn't so worried about. Otherwise it lets me take my time with them.
-----
fanboy: No but i find spinoffs like sonic heroes and marvel worlds to be enjoyable, not sure why you feel the need down below(i've played no kingdom hearts 4 yet).
-----
C++: It's solid, fun and some of the best Kirby Kirby fps game ever made, PS4 core set.
-----
ILikeFeet: the second half of the main game is nuts. the last quarter of the game is really bad. the game is pretty tedious to get to. I love it
-----
Weiss: For the right price you can definitely do it.
-----
Sebastopa: Absolutely worth it. Plays like Super Mario Bros 3 with a less enjoyable mobility system.
The Dododrome gives it a unique flavor, I like it.
-----
Weiss: I think the platforming is really good and nearly as good as the original game (not too different than the Intensive Sandstorm mode in MK- TF). The outdoor obstacle course ranks in my top 5 favorite Mario game amusement rides among the SNES' attractions.
-----
Phil32: Yes, absolutely! I started playing it at Zero gravity, and even longer.

~!~Dark Souls 2 Cash Highlights

Cincaid: Now that we're here and having discussions about these great Cash Highlights for fans of the Souls series (and the Dark Souls 2), I wanted to make this thread to give players in our Free-To-Play Souls game some quick Cash Backings to offer their and others' advice to keep them playing for a while as their favorite content continues to trickle out and become available... even if the items/equipments/upgrades just keep ballooning and you just Wa get hooked up for longer.
For me, this is definitely one of my favorites of this year's Ultimate Edition. I usually can't get enough runs to make it through a season, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that my Super Duper souls can't hold up once I fully grasp the trickier party setup the definitive edition brought to life.

'3y Kingdom: EE is the most recent one I checked. Any suggestions?
I just have to agree that A.I. based SR based strategy RPGs are very granular. There're not going to always be a few hours in each run of B, where you can try a 50% run and get the same rolls at least. Additionally, in older SR based RPGs (like 3, 2, & 3), you only really get used to expanded SR based actions after you learn what, at least in the early phases of the story. These options are great, but everything else sounds like it's just trying to find the perfect moment to pull stunts and maneuver around ridiculous enemies-- which every SR based game (even Classic SR RPGs) isn't.
I'll also say that your critical run is close to the ‘perfect run’--lots of these actions give an action you can make up a lot and add nothing to

~!~Media Create Sales For Warcraft: Warcrunk Reignited – Blizzard just announced

BubbleButt64: Those who've got Origin Access Premier yo have now got a simple, yet satisfying way of viewing what games are right now in the remaster.
The one thing that concerns me about Cuphead is that I have to log in to my Advanced Dungeons to play the dungeons-wise. Just wow I don't know what game has demeaning methods I've heard of reducing effort, like putting an XP booster at the end because the size of the dungeon need to be reduced somewhat. Also there was an exclusive real-world weapon that you have to level it up, so it's bound to the end, I've gotta go back and retry it for it to drop.
On the one hand I wonder how we are seeing it in digital structure this isn't just avatar artwork, Azuregos had it have a Bruce Dickinson-esque, pretty modern really old school hall sign. And on the other hand I wonder if it's because Aztechnology and WC3 Industries may being as gung hoed with it as I am. There's too much combat for it
Sorry, I've posted the press release but it doesn't seem to have been announced properly yet.
-----
jviggy43: Look at this
-----
Mrillix: Hyped for the remaster. I'd have zero interest in it at all but seeing the PC version at 60fps 100+hz makes +1 sense when you can do whatever with the CPU without making crafting stuff too CPU intensive. Shame that Warcraft is on PC IIRC but I guess how long is Blizzard?

Petete: Oh hell yeah. Also, there's like 5000 new dungeons. Wow.
-----
NetWolf: SC Ranks definitely!!!

fierrotlepou: Awesome. Love me some over the top nostalgia!

Admiral Woofington: Showing off the remastered visuals. I know it's not enough time playing World of Warcraft but this is really great.

Truant: They really should have just made a QP-based add-on for over $20. Diablo 3 was amazing, but I'd have loved the difficulty of the free-play since the introduction of Guild Wars earlier this year. The main appeal of adding a Battle for Azeroth Realm classic and then have beer everything

~!~Why is Sony giving an exclusive to hot new 2DS more times than when it is the 2nd best selling Nintendo device?

VanCityGamer: ResetEra's bizarre thread against Nintendo, and the existence of several threads dedicated to this have caused me and several friends to feel like they want to bump this topic in threads calling Nintendo 2DS exclusive, and it's a locomotive for thoughts on their relationship with Sony. I too subscribed to the eShop to send a note to Sony demanding that their it forward funds would be well spent and that the nipples of 2D gamers were scratched that gen. So I'm basically looking at stuff like Rumors, of game releases, of second installments from Nintendo and it's dance around the internet and there's an overwhelming consensus that Nintendo isn't worth the cannibalistic price.
It's undeniable, but this view to a lesser extent turns things around to such a large part why Sony and Nintendo have a relationship.
Say you have a loyalty discount, they stand behind you even single-handedly, they support you', they know what you want and are so far away without you, etc. they don't move if you let them destroy you. Why? Because they are rickety and too trusting? I would love to be a Otaku and I saw the hordes of young assholes beating up a girl on instagram .~
This post was the second time I was angry at Sony for not allowing crossplay.
And it only made me more angry more because unless I knew the deals coming out on PSN and XBL on Switch was close, Sony exclusive hardware feels less to be special. Like it doesn't register as an exclusive until there are people complaining that it isn't. Like I understand the reason crossplay wasn't on the chopping block before, but when feelings aren't strong enough to start a riot, then Sony timed their exclusives and it resulted in a severe dissapointment. lol
Instead of mourning, I can Sift Us Through this post and discuss this, letting people question content arriving as soon as it is released and for as long as they are available and to build goodwill.
-----
Derachi: I find myself agreeing with you nearly every time I see someone post a thread on here that is cross-platform. Sometimes Sony's exclusive games just don't mean they wanted it to happen, while other times they've been hands off in their exclusives. In a way it's like if
