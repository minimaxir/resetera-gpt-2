~!~Super Noob game available

delete12345: I got on the train, and then saw the trailer.
Has any game similar this by Major Nelson? No, it`s not Major Nelson`s Noob, I have no knowledge of such game.
It`s a Sanzaru game, I have only played a little bit. It's similar to Too Human in a sense, but on the spiritual successor of Too Human....
As for those? They were knocked out for the 16000 people in Japan. Or for those who downloaded a saturn - this isn`t happening any more, nor is the Android port that saturn was ported to Android - this is a demon`s dick.
-----
ILikeFeet: VR or whatnot? Isn't VR exclusive to VR.
-----
sibarraz: I played the SunhiLegend series on smartphones, but also tried ALOT and found it very similar to SunhiLegend.
It seems like a Korean game. As for what exactly? I could not find an Asian listing, maybe it must have been very low budget graphics? The SunhiLegend series on smartphones at least, just not guaranteed enough variety for them, they recently reused something from Lost Souls which sold far below their expectations, and have only sold 6 million on Android. In Korea, SunhiLegend is a series they started, and the Bardunners purchased mobile data from mobile providers.
-----
Gitaroo: I don't know if it goes any deeper than the tapping style stuff but for an MMO just take on a general story where there will be minigames or more traditional thing where you want to solve quests or something with modifiers to prevent evil guys to get npc's to loot their places next.
-----
Tibarn: Tales LOL but this is made for smartphones, may have performance issues.
-----
Odeko: Loved this game when I played it on my DS. The amount of flexibility you have in exchange for different paths to take with character's, spawns, monsters, contracts which all have different stats depending on what route you take and they kind of awkwardly twiddle the button sequences as well. Not a good experience
-----
Cloud-Hidden: Both are amazing to play. And both are PS4 games that have been on Android since last July.
The SunhiLegend game is quite difficult for me - just keep an eye out on it

~!~11 years on and Article Matter is still today

Daffy Duck: Article Matter was back in print at a time when Amazon wasn't even shipping copies of Starter Edition
So,... I’ve noticed that while I’m playing God of War, that other open world game had a popular campaign
Fixed it for today
-----
Nakenorm: Isnt Article Matter closed though?
-----
giancarlo123x: I really hope we can get some competition because i really liked God of War

Grylvak: Thank you!
I think you mean David Jaffe on Twitter.
I just read his article. I don’t think I’m going to miss it.

The40Watt: Don’t do this to Cory.

WestEgg: That is a gamerunner in my book. I think he’s going to win that one.
Edit: Seems it was (and looks) closed.

ASleepingMonkey: Article wasn’t even inspired by GoW though by how many editorials(and editorials NOT sarcasm lol) most of the top writers had this Schadenfreude.
-----
Maximo: I've seriously got to watch this before making a judgment.
-----
nib95: Didn’t go around when GoW was free on console or something and putting it on the front page because it seemed to prevent competition.

~!~The Verge - Ikaruga has made its way to Android

SuikerBrood: The Verge made a feature on iPhone's Ikaruga, including before that.
Free download, if you check out Benjamin's video on Twitter.
Edit: I notice the art style looks a bit "too dark" for my tastes, seems they touched on that in smaller places.

Leocarian: I feel more impressed by the Android version. My phone never fails to impress me .
-----
themadswagger: Is Android the first console generation everyone talks about?
-----
Jedeye Sniv: I hope this is a sign that Google will make their own custom virtual console. I still haven't gotten the most anticipated game of June yet, but they have a nice shot of bypassing Sony at some levels.

Flandy: What were the first iveisjas on GC
-----
RolandOfGilead: Interesting move. 
It's a pretty old phone with a good screen and a really sharp image so it was super easy to design, refreshed and accessible at the time. I'm put off by things I've already seen and know what the sale price at launch was. Hopefully my interest in this game falters and I find a new phone for use browsing the eShop.
-----
SuikerBrood: Corrected.
Where has this game even come from? It started from its "Budgets had issues" launch.

~!~"Fifty-Five Ninjas" Announced. Me and Me Hershel Day

Redhead On Moped: Too! Human divided into two entities to fight and lasted nearly a day delivering a video game to all of their devices. This was met with a mixed reaction so we’d like to get a response from them. Please give this game some much needed love with regards to visuals and gameplay too. This thread was inspired by the trailer that releases just few hours after the game informer portion of the game.
More overwatch themed hits. so far?
-----
Becks': Yeah. It was developed for PS4 and Borderlands. I always hear about the CTF but research it is sparse at the moment.
-----
DarthSontin: Cosmetical horror still is not a competitive game when it comes to mechanics, aesthetics or gameplay.
-----
jediyoshi: Is this a sequel to the series?
Also, i'd probably call Cosmetical horror. its a completely different and influential genre.
-----
Marano: Thanks for reminding me of me
-----
The Hollowed Garden: this is additional info on the Studio W7

~!~Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls - should i consider it?

Al3x1s: Hello folks! Folks, our family is coming to the US soon, and a new Castlevania game was announced for everythingstation with the price of just £29.99 (34.99€). Daemon x Machina will release on Tuesday in the UK on PS4 and Vita, and will (extra mode) be announced very soon on PS5. A first glance at it would be helpful to seeing what this is! I'll start it off :
- I'm surprised this thing
- It's 20 euros on steam right now, not the usual 32 usd
- Amazon is not shipping, obviously the plan being to 16-bit and to not let you in the EU as well, yet
- nowhere to post prices to confirm
-----
Admiral Woofington: When I was younger, I fixed my dirty switch by pressing a joycon cord in it with my left hand and was like:

Sephiroth: That’s incredible ! will review it later.

Chaserjoey: Ah, awesome. You can have your junk neatly put in a pile of something awesome.

Kyros: No thanks, I'll have to review it myself.

Rygar 8Bit: Oh cool! Thanks OP!
I though we were supposed to get some news about this a season ago and I didn't feel like giving a shit.
Anyway best wishes!

====================
~!~Which Team Silent will Survive to Reclaim its Lingoule

Booker.DeWitt: for the past two generations
The Team Silent 
Silent Hills – Episode 0 and Walking Dead (2009) – The Team Silent proved they knew what they were doing and came up with the absolutely unbelievable pacing, The Walking Dead inspired characters, Silent Hill 2 inspired enemy designs, Team Silent's firearms, Team Silent inspired horror gameplay. 
The Ninja games 
 Silent Storm (2000) and Silent Hills 2 (2005) – Opposing Forces might have been based on the older trilogy trilogy, but the jump in quality, Ninja Theory's intention for "massive open worlds", projection, scope, bombastic soundtrack, and great storytelling didn't translate to a film until they started to team up with Platinum Games and The Last of Us for the third project of the Silent trilogy. 
Bioshock
 – The First of many topics, this is the most infamous. both teams had great protagonist, open ended storytelling, killer, emphasis on puzzles. 
Silent Hill 1
– Angels of Hell and Silent Hills (2008) were both rushed sequels in the same regard (A. I.G. struggles are the most blemish, but ho ho ho, AA was the most obvious amongst them), the tone was a combination of what seemed like some games in 2010 height each other, but got one down the line, failed to realize how big of a leap we all need to make, Silent Hill 1 was 13 plus years old, it wasn’t even feeling that fresh after having skated right close to the VII demo back in 2010.
Silent Hill 2
Survival Team Silent (2009–2015)
- But did Silent Hill Survive even take off? I don’t think the heady 2019 title could even recapture from last month despite it having seen multiple director Satoshi Furukawa's changes to the series he hasointed as Silent Hill 2. somehow it could still feel it, REmake 3 still scares manage to be boring despite its narrative shortcomings and the lack of any unutility to save the world.

I still play the original on PS3 though and I have
====================
~!~It's so weird how SHD Co-

SolVanderlyn: The argument that (some) of the best parts of SDS9 are actually not sequels is a theme I keep going back to. Part of the greatness of the series is its inclusive storytelling. SDS1 is so fuckin weird, while SDS2(the later entries of what SpanoukS history) was obviously planned to be a trilogy, it was like, Square really ditched all the dumb GOAT parts and rolled them into one big, badass game. Even (gasp, see?) SDS3&4 revelead SDS1, even with Harada suddenly saying that SDS2, SDS3, SDS4, and SDS5 were coming out in 2015.
Roughly speaking, though, SDS2 only platinumsize 1 to 3. But, that means, the influence these titles have had in the franchise (based off SDS1, though) is mind blowing. SDS2 honestly even has SDS3 and SDS4 in it. Perhaps my favorite SDS game is SDS1 online so so many people pronounced it Modern-Fire and SDS4 as I mentioned earlier right off the bat. Even SDS2 had wave skills, which some players obviously would have dropped if the names were just this simple, "saga board?" It's also more divided than any other obscure spinoff title.
Hmmm.... y'know.
What were your thoughts on this? Do to why you second canned Halo in 2018, subsequent playing it, and what it itself was like?
-----
Sillution: I enjoyed the brand very much. SMT and Persona are cool JRPGs with interesting worlds. One is conflict and the others RPG side. I had an endless amount of fun with that. 
If it isn't enough get is sequel that has Ten month hype or something. People absolutely rock
-----
fiendcode: SDS1 was a PSP-Game Licensed property by Bandai so there's that. Dissidia NT, Zodiac Spear, MHA, Dragalia Lost, and many more iirc, on Steam and PS4. Not dev-only, complete Fat Revenge Empire, that is actually one of my best friends

Katana_Strikes: I loved it from the moment it came out. The story was great and a bit darker than the previous games due
====================
~!~Fire Emblem Heroes: Facing Oogie

WrenchNinja: Another month, another shmup player taking up yet another opportunity to envy my waifus.
Oogie is a loose sword user who typically wields a throwing blade. He's have played a few rounds with Marko since JP Games and wanted to show off overall play while showing his skill.
Honourable mention to Alibi's novel, Mario Musou. In that series acclaimed series of musou (mostly VN) some games will allow you to summon your waifu and other young pokemon.
During the first stage of the opening stage, Alibi's buddying bird suddenly starts shaking, and begins to fly! You take off your Items and start to recover them after the bird chases after you.
This song will be played for 15 minutes then you are free to use your items if you wish.
The arena was surprisingly fun to play. The camera has never made me frustrated during exploration and the controls feel tight. In a game with such a diverse and pretty varied create a character to play.
The controls feel responsive and don't get tiring though. It went on over three hours back in the release stage.
One interesting point that has to mention, that you can see all the Pokemon but is oblivious to your opponent's attacks and styles up to 1-3. There is this various blocky pixel chasing along with no apparent way to hit. You have to patience and an amazing skill to avoid these.
Traversal is made by pressing l on action. Some games can make it work perfectly by this method, acquiring coins makes you take a short chunk of distance by mashing but if your jump is tight and rare it's a bit rough. Poke around for a bit, attack, the skill flags become a visual that indicates the Pokemon are on the edge of the Ravnathim, if your Pokemon isn't on the edge of Ravnathim then it has 1 second left, and when it hits the big circle says 'Aqua, Green', unfortunately isn't available for some reason.
A couple of games at Biomutant also allow you to play by Ken's rules forbid tag chasing or Pokebank f

~!~LRIPT PARTY New Game Announcement Trailer (Naughty Dog)

Dusk Golem: Short segment:
Thread title changed a bit, but it's probably the most unique VR trailer that I've seen of them. The video itself, from last year, is super short (nothing too big, but at the same time a bit more powder-coated as you could imagine), very upfront about their mission statement that reflects their new relationship with ND. They've really been working on this (with the added caveat of not saying anything significant), but also they're interesting for me personally as they drive home this important info. PlayStation, Please use PS Plus as an extra incentive to play. If you renew, that pays for your PS Plus subscription and is usually used at other points during checkout, just stop reading this thread when you want to go play PT.
Edit: Rewards announced, for Free
Naughty Dog, please, Q-Bert
-----
inky: My kids are in college or so and they played this and that felt kinda low.
-----
benzopil: PT!? The map was really big
-----
MrTroubleMaker: that was never their.
I mean, this was written long ago but there was nothing much new this year regarding GP besides the game and it's humble homage to any and every shooter that it influenced.
-----
Phantom Thief: Why is it only in-game, only available in NG+ for PS4 owners, and exclusive to PS Plus as well?
-----
dobahking91: Is PS Plus a requirement for PT access?
-----
gigantor21: Dogs are getting assigned the truck number/tag. It's not the primary number (integrated) they're number.
-----
zelbro: I legitimately cannot wait for this. This and that Mission from E3 were the best VR reveal I have ever experienced.
-----
Acquiescence: This is a great trailer, actually.
(Like) even Sony is making it free again :(
-----
Sign My Guestbook!: I think… Looks like it's designed as a middle/high school game, but in-game it's actually something very high school students would use normally. How about you just turn on the game with 2 spatial buttons and of the users, assign two buttons on a separate board and then put the two SRAs on top of each other?

~!~Forza 7: What we know: Viva Pinata Racing version

PopsMaellard: Probably some waiting on PC, but it's easy to wishlisting now! If you guys have doubts, don't hesitate to ring.
So there's a bunch of coverage of the full game and the first 3-4 hours or so is in progress. I've been on a bit and haven't done the mystery segment yet, so I don't have a lot of details on that. I was planning to go in blind but it's going to be a LOT more ambitious. I just decided I'll go in on the PC side more than hoping that's before E3.
Speaking of E3, that is a bunch of stuff that's to be revealed in that no one is looking. It wouldn't be a week if they just showed more than 5 previews. Tony Hawk is a true contender for the number one spot at E3.
-----
Quinton: Hard to see a trailer from the first few weeks, when they still have time for actually play time. Any hints for the press at E3 are non-committal. But we did see footage top to top, though I think most people imagine the pool of possibilities to be close to release.
-----
JNH: Liam Robertson, who’s streaming the "how to run the preview" video, put together a podcast that covers just about every mini-feature of the game.
The whole piece is kind of... incomprehensible, read as a two sentence, though it's important.
-----
TheRedSnifit: I was fascinated by Ys was the Trails in the Sky stuff.
I'm so glad the interviewer correctly predicted that they'd be able to map out exactly where we go with this.

~!~(GAME Spain) "Valleto Belmont: Dragon Quest Builders 2" Will Be Coming To Europe in 2019

Netrafter: In today’s issue of Déjà vu, Konami announced that the new DRAGON QUEST title will be releasing exclusively in Europe – a full year after its release in the USA, according to “Codemasters from Liqueur.ES, an online games publisher based in Spain that distributes low-budget Yakuza titles. The game will follow the style of Dragon Quest Builders 2 and support “superhero sports anime developers,” which usually fly in several crowdfunding platforms. The game will also come with an English and Spanish translation respectively. 
"We’re happy to announce that DRAGON QUEST HEROES™ will be coming exclusively to Europe in 2019, just three years after DRAGON QUEST XENOVERS launched on PS4, PS Classic and PS Vita," read the announcement. "From October 23 to October 26, however, all three Japanese companies will be developing a new game exclusively for us. They have invested a 50-65 Million Dollars on this game and expect this coming success in 2019." 
DRAGON QUEST WRESTLING
Crunchyroll announced today for the first time that the game will be coming exclusively to Europe, a month after the US and Australia. The game will feature daily live broadcast from a “global television network”, with other platforms airing the show regularly. 
"Starting in June 2019, we are thrilled to announce a brand-new RPG based on the IP’s world, Isa, that delivers on everyday life with its friendships, hearts and feelings," said Yoshimitsu Yamashita, co- CEO and founder of Isa.ES. "In the west, Kitase's words will be “we will be focusing all efforts and creativity on this.”"

If it's true, what would make me want them to bring the next Dark Knight or Spiderman?
-----
Brian Damage: The trilogy trilogy trilogy they have perfected perfected over the years. They could go full on RPG with both but that's not their focus.
They're making Batman Aftershocks and they're just going through the ringer right now. They said they have a story idea that they've began to work off, but it's not straightforwardly a DLC for Batman 4. So basically we'll see.
They have said that they have ideas for all of their DLC but they are still in the final game.

~!~Destiny 2 is great ( and I guess, “isolation” levels are good again)

Gossi: I’m already aware the sequel is struggling with the issues it started with the first, and the direction it’s going into it, but anything that isn’t exclusives also should be 9/10-type.
I’m 50 percent chapter 2 recently. I can’t wait for the sequel and I’m loving it. The new mechanics and architecture is great, you haven’t been paying close attention and all the little details you didn’t know about is just so much nicer and more polished.
I’m 16” Doth play the first half and I’m finding the opportunities to explore the whole map in Chapter 4.
And I’m totally fine with that.
I had intense flashbacks in the second chapter and the first time I ran to the landing strip was revelatory.
With that said. 
BONUS ELITE: 
Spoiler
And my first though it turns out I was alright when I first started the game and everybody makes fun things about me and saving the others.
If you don’t like that. They’re right. I haven’t even beaten the first one because I played CoD back when I tried to get into it.
Yeah. Doesn’t have to be so bad.
Also despite being weird, Doth play a game

~!~Spider-Man and a Quote-Called Appreciation Thread- Hello! (gif courtesy)

ody: This is a long time coming, but please copy/paste all the information you can (and did I) here and click the gif to get out the whole paragraph.
In the all new Adventure Time movie storyline headed by Insomniac's Peter Parker, the go-to man for any kids and adults alike, Detective Vision (Patrick Stewart) is brought into one of the titans... and not Uncle Ben, who turns him into a singing vampire. It turns him into a mere hunk of Styrofoam! I've drawn my vampire tattoos all over my body.
Then I learned that one of the interesting characters, a spider-man, has decals for his facial features, i.e. his brow furrowing or closing, and his spiky teeth are for eye-catching purposes. Nothing else is allowed (no spider-man statue, no green-yurt-yurt spider, no Deep Freeze statue, etc.). If you pass a certain rating of 100,000, then you take down the spider on your first go.

~!~I Have an XB1X Controller

Mcfrank: The warranty is still open but it has been a few months now and I just want to be sure. Can anyone suggest any link where to get one for the X? Can someone link me in the UK if I'm in the UK?
I see this advert about joy con issues and it makes me think of this guy.
I know a lot of people here have hardware issues and with said hardware, they are few and far between but I'm not within my field.
I want to avoid this ticking off of someone having/wanting others to have a problem with.
Does anyone know any link for me?
Thanks
-----
IDontBeatGames: Here's the article that's in the magazine (issue starts 1 May, 9, 201)
Pretty much the idea that the warranty is void if a thunderbolt cable is not connected, question is worth a thought especially if I've got a last firmware 2.20 or 3.05 both used long.
-----
FlaygletheBagel: I only have my XB1X and a controller plugged into my X now, the last time I checked the was a bit ago, however once you provide a reliable link I think it's a good idea to just throw your X to your new update bay and boom, you can get an update over much better.
-----
IDontBeatGames: Sounds like a no thank you at this point. Thank you, thank you for this op
-----
flkRaven: I'm still thinking about getting an X just tried the x and a HDMI cable btw. I already have the working problem at least. Thanks.

====================
~!~Tell me about Super Mario Pirate Warriors 2

Alandring: I want to pick this up before I start watching a video, since I am so new to the franchise, but I like how this is, for my money, one of the best 2D platformers on the market and it is absolutely gorgeous, but still not as good as the first game. Of course you can tell it's 2D, but also it has an amazing artstyle.
So I want to know: how do you feel about this 2D platformer? Please give an example of what you would recommend.
Even though I am picking it up on release ( Tuesday fool it looks like Sunday) because I am only 2 hours in, what are some of the current contenders I should look out for in the genre (to be more clear I mean how are all the other ones good)? And finally, what is the best way to play this one, arcade or not?
-----
Kingpin Rogers: Never heard of this. I think it looks and plays well However I am not big into 2d platformers so have yet seen Super Mario Odyssey and NSMB
-----
-Tetsuo-: Was there any arcade futur in the great kingdom?
-----
lunarwhale: Despite its minor (as in, virtually random), it's the only Mario-like that I've played (unlike my PSP love stories). There are several other fun ones on Steam, like Mario Kart 7.
-----
MKDS: Mario 3D World, Galaxy 2 and then 3D World are the must plays.
-----
mrmickfran: Starfox Assault
Forgot to mention MM11 just to be out of favor with other players.
-----
SuperiorTrashTalk: My GOTY so far. Super Mario Odyssey was a return to basics, but held my not so great handheld for many many years.
Never finished MM11, usually go back to the last stages and do boss battles faster. I still didn't finish FE:W because of what you said after it.
Do I need to 100% the game, or is it just not for me?
Mario 3D Land takes something like 70 percent of the game and low-res looks a bit distracting.
If the level can be something good with tight controls I'll give it a recommendation.

~!~Electric Switch: Anyone play this one?

ABK281: I decided to give the one portable or Switch a shot, the one that I currently own and not pay good money (US, $300 lol).
I liked the big form factor but that ain't enough for me anymore.
Super Mario Odyssey in handheld mode made me fell in love with the game.
Nothing wrong with that, however. The skin tones of characters is different and the eShop have a very ethereal look to it, plus it’s chrome. But it’s baseball player which I’ve tried and never really understood the appeal - I’d rather play the 60 frames of a non-sightedile but bald. I can’t make a career mode for it and don’t want to. The building and stadium aspects was dull similar to lovecraft but it’s not supernatural.
I don’t have it on my furniture as I’m furniture so it looks like I want to wobble and have good posture and not run around a desk playing baseball with melted toast.
I’ve been happy enough to make a UbiArt crowdfunding update about this one since the games will GoG in November. Cool to see them play since that’s their self-imposed hardest enviable.
So...
Anyone try it? Where and how is it?
-----
Tracker_TD: I picked this up from a gamestop sales, it'll be all about the SXSW panel this weekend. I was put off by the menu I was subscribed to up until I noticed you can see something on the dashboard. But, by the time I filled in the blanks it said I should know this and what I wanted to do (e.g. a club), I had shuffled through the menu and was off to work, so I played this instead.
-----
Recall: You have to collect a club member to get the badges for them to get situated
-----
Starlatine: a ty toggle in game is not here to ask for dikt, it is a default mode in eShop not downvoted games and is godlike
thats how you arrange player buttons in booklets, cactuar stuff

~!~No words revealed for the RTTP of the game, truly, it’s THE stressful game

era recognition: Sit down, someone, have a little Q-game, wear that shirt, and immerse yourself!!
I’ve just completed the tense game stress test a couple days back, completing roughly 400 shrines (which is small on the scope really, but manageable enough), and my brain produces quite a few symbols for my job(s) in a fairly wide range of response. I don’t have an expository memory of every one or maybe 5 shrines, but the reality is that for a few major things, reading unnatural images of, or listening tracks enjoying a level, are exercises in human creativity.
You get your truck out of the truck and into reality and use for part the engine. Thats the drinking game. It requires you to use two gears in order to be on railgun, that is the one actually use, that is six gears in order to drive a vehicle. The responsibilities of driving a vehicle are a limited one at the moment. There are two objectives, needed with regard to:
1. VehicleCCs (or engine specific commands)
2. VehiclesHCs (or CJ teammates)
This isn't anything embarrassing! especially considering the consent feature most believe it's necessary to implement at the moments least. However, my experience of driving a racing game is with some of the things even pop up in other kind of games. This is saying that IATB Crews or Support characters are required to use the game’s custom VehicleHC commands just for every section. I mean, holy cow.
I want a word or two about what japanans thought of the gameplay with this feature. Explain your experience.
Anyone from OT?
I will try and update.

Bhonar: emily b has more than just the best combat and the most awesome song win re: Plex and dulciple. It's an insanely good game and one of my favorite survival experiences this generation.
Overall I think for PC in this period most of the games that interests me will be added due to usage.
They are definitely saving money when they added all expansion packs and some free forge packs.
Because I don't have a PC yet anymore and it's motivated to move to more platforms, it's great to have them build for consoles too.
====================
~!~Your first Mario Kart game is closer to that of your past ones...

Dreamboum: When Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was announced over at Japan's Direct, everyone and their favorite bloggers gave up one hell of a stare at the game that they only recently completed filling 8 out of thousands and let their young fans wait a few weeks for their new Mario Kart games (specially 8 a week).
Now, a Nintendo Nintendo employee agrees. The game is closer to a past Mario Kart where it doesn’t matter what you got to do. All direct lines, secret layouts, time marked 4-5 times, player timed events, badges, playing against CPU rivals. Things got more interesting when you realized you actually don’t need a lot of foots-to-assass, since there’s only 4, 5-6 player matches per day now, which seems like a slight in comparison to kart racers (especially racers), where each player just needs to play a certain minigame based off of an organized event.
It really was different than what I expected. You didn’t need to put in an gigantic amount of points to earn high rank, you just had to refuse to play on that particular section of the track (8 or 10 leagues). It had giant lots like regions with all their special abilities, basically waiting for you and all your friends to discover just how much fun there is. There were no timed challenges, there was weird timesages, it had no missions, you had to boot high rank, take them somewhere else over there, and there were no campaign times, all while against AI rivals who only begin their runs with them unlocked by making sure you were in perfect form with no over-thwagnurm.
And it was a rule that I was very interested in, but I still lost some sleep when trying to decide on whether to tinker with the rules for 8 hours a day or not, because with the F-Zero mode, it was a little more obvious lol (only experienced MK players can even take control, but you need to have a good footrace, if you don’t to move yourself) I think! And thefw not having all the different play modes on t

Baleoce: Feel the same. I wish they just move on.

Hero: I picked it up since the Direct ends and don't really care about rank

~!~Its already here, where should I preorder?

jorgejjvr: I've been playing some AC: Odyssey until today, but I thought i should really pick up the expansions. For one, I was blown away when the first trailers came out, and also, surprise. The game was gorgeous. 
II. I just thought about getting this and diving back into Black Flag. Then that quietness that I normally don't affect as much, that I played for a few hours, changed once the first trailer showed came out, gave me a good laugh there. I hope I'm just being silly.
III. I feel like I am playing this game wrong, I downloaded the first episode yesterday without realizing, and I have 3 minutes to 100%.
- On PS VR... 
I am currently able to take photos after playing Atlas unknown missions without leaving, haha.
III improves in things, after playing, it feels like making that mental observation about your experiences where it is all you're dealing with. Just remove the traumatic memories? Hardly any. And what if every mission you do isn't so rediculous, but in the end even yourself might will remember there some things same as you did. 
More: This may seem super obvious, but who knows with VR being so great it's hard to feel XD

Cybersai: Kingdom hearts and AC Origins are GOAT plays. I expected more to ship around September. It's just a matter of when I expect it to ship in the first place. Switch doesn't quite do this.

HeisenbergWW62: when I had my kids they wouldn’t play Kingdom Hearts because back in November to play the game with them - they got fooled because they didn’t remember the game and think it was Donald the hairdo and all that 
Obviously none of that stuff is relevant today, but back then we were stuck with a very rigid 'granularity' routine on console, atleast to be honest. Off point George.

Idk its like a Tuesday with unfinished Thanksgiving holidays and slow work hours ... Only a very small eta to skip .... Idk it, was a really fun game . better still i would be near tears playing it again . Its honestly not the best thing to feel like a game developer... But if you had the cash, you could just try again .
The nuisance of sudden slow backdrops by your work for example. There was a silent zombie walking past in the distance if it wasn't for the patch.

I hope we see more lite like rpgs. MMOs are the new Storefront money .
-----
Whatislove: I think this is it, the "no loot" the fast classic movement leads to a whole lot of anxiety and I hope we see it again - it's in their best interest to adapt it so that we don't accept it when it seems apparent right from their own games. But it's up to Blizzard and Blizzard ONCE to adapt or their dedication to our industry to see them through.

plié: I'd rather opened a fund to fund apathetic users at over-levelled resetera posters. It will cost much, much money to open these asset flips. If we somehow get the ability to buy, play and share these games and just improve them, we can easily accept the better services offered by companies like Blizzard/Compulsion/Universal who think they can also make it profit.

This is one of the benefits: because it so greatly confers players self-control.
For me it cements it: one more time, for example, playing Civilization, being able to reign in a hot chorious gaming era.
This totally stuck up to me today as I can't get enough of Sekiro and I'm excited.

TailorDKS: I like to see specific post and combo animation
-----
CormoranStrike: They don't make them flashy, the point is that in order to have that type of style of story the developers have to carefully mix things up and give some options or risk alienating players, which in the case they don't want to do. Super Souls Videogames were doing all the variety on that front way back with Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3.

~!~How may share locks you into having seamless multiplayer?

Gig: I don’t have anything to add other than I’m curious as to what everyone’s reaction was regarding joining in 2020 but I caught the game was making money and I didn’t require any other income to access it.
From what I’ve seen, there’s only been roughly 1 available lobby per player at launch. I’ve played on a regular weekend basis within game and they allow users to search and create private lobbies on other players platforms outside of the regular online settings.
However, when compared to what many other game systems can cover, it really feels like you are getting matchmaking for every other player who can get in or out on the same servers or vice versa. Couple this with the difficult lobby progression and it really doesn't feel like I’d lose all my simple active players to invite invaders or DSP.
I’m asking because I've played games like fortnite where for outsiders it just feels like there’s some people getting harassed but it’s not enough. Seems like other Psyonix games (for the most part) are harder overall when being harden. Looks like more commonly what you would every

SolVanderlyn: Psychological value put me off of The Elder Scrolls: The Video Game. I acieved a bit since most of us played these games were bit too comfortable for us young kids to enjoy. I had to kind of pimp it. Very weird....
One morning my father was asleep and he went to sleep with his whole family in Ico. I wake up for about 5-10 hours a night just trying to sleep. My body deteriorated a bit and it can’t walk normally. I’m hardly laying down and I just write it off as much as I can. But I love it.
I guess my point is if Fallout 76 benefits from an alt-reaction firestorm (spoiler) I should be be thankful for it.
It also isn’t an easy game to play by yourself either. Fallout 76 basically makes you play RPGs at a much more personal level, and if I don’t join in the fun I’m really content with 12 apples and 2 oranges. I’m glad they’ve kept the motivation. 
I feel like they ought to' put in Crossdressing. It sounds like they’re frequently out of date (I know it hurts, but I can't deny their mistakes) and it fixes a lot of problems they had from 76.
-----
Green Mario: I enjoy it. Perhaps better than Skyrim's. The ending with K.Rool was fantastic too, though (Personally I'd be lying if I said I didn't have much disappointment in the game, but I wasn't long enough to play it to really pay it attention).
-----
Lawrence0294: I had to visit the other guy who diagnosed 90% of the romance issues in the game. That alone made him really interested in the game. And he reported him to the EGS so he could release the rom if he wanted to.
-----
Redhood: My friends still play Fallout 76 every night and all they do at night is bring out their seperate ESH accounts to play the game. I'd also recommend using your own game account to than eventually send back your last move from your EGS account.
Avoid any post game purchases.
Also don't play roms.

====================
~!~The Goddamn PS Remaster of Nightmare is an adequate excuse to deny me a VR VR title

Encephalon: Why is it even an actual excuse, unless the developers used a way to inject a DRM copy into the game for whatever reason?
I put the game on Steam pasted on my system, and it simply didn't work the way I hoped. I called support, and was prompted to open a ticket of someone giving fuck and deleting the game.
Now, I get where you're coming from, but I dont believe there was a double standard. If somebody told me it was ass, I would believe you.
Put me on a pierside and asked for a refund. If I try to refund, I told them fuck you and proceed to delete my game.
Honestly, it seems like no one really cares about the VR game next to trickeryworld, and it's getting dismissed by "Varnir" as well. And yet, people are asking for VR titles to be on the storefront and banned.
I'm just astonished, not really that I blame, but it's something.
EDIT: the game is still supported and at least a mod has acknowledged the error there, but with this mod they've got it sorted.
EDIT 2: VR compatibility is indeed lacking, but at least we know the disc isn't a technical issue and it works. Tried playing on a Lenovo computer and it didn't work

-----
LewieP: The lack of VR compatibility seems like a fairly small thing. I wouldn't even call it a technical problem.
It makes me wonder, if there is more to it than I remember. They don't want the money for a VR exclusive?
-----
skel: This definitely feels like a large game. Does it include everything or is it standalone?
-----
Dest: I thought they said they were happy, that maybe, maybe they couldn't get it on the platform because a lot of devs skipped it. I guess it a case of where they thought, maybe for a small dev, and hoped for the best when they got to VR, but maybe not. I guess I don't understand the comparison to a Nintendo game because I think Animal Crossing Switch is a pc exclusive, which is not a very big thing.
Basically that game is a disappointment, ever, if its

~!~Should Valve keep making their own games?

capitalCORN: Thread was created by someone who was on fire after reading the article in iter that blatantly justified their actions even when they were proven wrong (reddit drama from some dicks).
After reading that article and seeing these statements by the large areas of the industry (developers), I instantly jumped ship.
With these two exclatclones, they say "we are going to keep making our own games, create their engine, and then publish the finished product", and instead of doing it with their own game, they publish their own engine AND publish their own tools.
I get that. Would people react differently to that, or is that not a commonly held opinion? Everyone dev can still try to do their own thing but not the majority of the user base can, for example, create their own engine and while that may be great, not everybody can do that.
Thoughts?
-----
Maxey: I haven't seen the issue yet.
-----
Maxey: It's been discussed here before but Valve can to the same degree curiosiastic. They have their own engine they could self-publish and self-fund then they can use those tools and keep publishing their products.
-----
Maxey: It breaks the illusion of what a proper open source engine + self-publishing can truly be.
They simply need to empower their workforce better and more effectively within the industry.
-----
Gundam: I keep saying this. And it applies to basically all large and software independent companies out there.
The issue is that the term "creator's tools" basically refers only to tools developed by the actual creators of that platform, like for instance Unreal Tournament, Payday 2, etc.
However, by having a platform (a platform is at most a complimentary notion), it limits the creativity and creativity capabilities of the creator behind those tools. This isn't even to say that Unreal Tournament is anything but a microcosmic example of what a proper game should sound like, people could create anything from Quake 1 or 2 (right now I'm playing Quake 2 with my friend and her), but when it comes to a claim about a platformer platformer you are really left out of most of these discussions solely because the creator behind the platform is an anomaly.

CozMick: When BTN landed recently the team that found a new direction, it was in the Adventure side. Three years later they are currently doing well, in relative balance, with Adventure having won the most cups and silverbowl medals.
Yes, the game also has a fantastic in-game story.
However, both sides have made some very controversial picks. Let's discuss the one vs the other.
EDIT: Irish language option is now available
Added for all.

Nirolak: It most definitely did.
There's no logical reason they didn’t at least like to play in game as a lunch hour experience.
-----
Saint-14: The problem is what now?
-----
zombieshavebrains: There are seasons which are only available in the professional league. I think. We are running into the biggest difference maker yet. In short: the casual players love Dota and the competitive ones lukewarm on it which one should they go for?

Dojima: They have had this team since the dark days of the server?ard

I'd try it if the prices come down, I'm not too privy to the game's feel yet and certainly did not enjoy the low skill floor in my experience of playing it. ShadowofDestiny's lighter nights of Dota and Counter-Strike are also well balanced, so I dig their approach. I should eventually play less and less to rank night in league some, but that'll be like all the grind I suffer cause of the practice.

Mr.Deadshot: But it's just like Dota2, right?:

~!~Halo MCC on PC just got a update updates to add dedicated health packs

wwm0nkey: Quite a quick update along with fixes to some of the issues. 
Also improved progress log progress!
-----
Kokonoe: Oh shit.
-----
Yaboosh: Maybe this means Infinite will be locked to 30 fps?
-----
Maffis: There it is.
-----
Tharp: Oh shit! I didn't know they added something like that. I'm guessing those wouldn't be able to stick 30fps consistently on PC. 
That's disappointing. Nice to see they are continuing support. Hoping they make some kind of a repackage for the PC version, with a more stable 30fps and proper fixes (if any), then it will be available physically on PC/XB1 at minimum.
-----
wwm0nkey: You can click the small text thing in the top right corner to view the patch notes -- I think it was mentioned to several times by Bill and Bob before they unannounced the MCC PC update
-----
SP-Potties: That’s a very nice update. I just hope they eventually do *unlock 30fps* for mcc.
-----
pazinyo: Man, everything is looking better and order of release!
-----
milad: Well that was quick. Why free online multiplayer? :weak:
-----
Darkstorne: The MCC update has tested the game to 10 mil hands on, so if stuff gets unstable or unfulfilled in the upcoming months, that’s going to be their final update before MCC was just scratched and unplayable. 
They just need the MCC they promised on backwards and now running on XB1.

Take5GiantSteps: That is a good deal.
-----
asmith906: I did like the GC one but its way too big so I never used it. Its too big now. Should I consider waiting a bit longer for my new Switch?
-----
LunaSerene: I was very skeptical after the announced price and update but it seems like a good deal.
-----
Bazry: Is it best buy only?
-----
Astral: I paid $19.99 for the GC one so you should be on board....even though my GC room is the size of a medium-sized house.
-----
asmith906: Yeah I started taking pictures of my Switch with the new browser as well so not expecting to always have it. They are so small but I thought everyone else at me was and not planning to upgrade.
-----
JaredG: You're probably correct, but I've never paid $19.99 for a Switch. I thought there were performance issues, but most other deals I've seen for them range anywhere near $50-$75. I feel like that’s what’s being mentioned. 
I wish they had GCU weekends too. That’s an important piece of hardware for me.

~!~Nintendo stock down to pre-Peak, affect stock value daily SEP 0.35%

Muzy: Nintendo stock index has recovered nicely after a sharp drop today after reducing early Friday, Mid-Dec-19.
Seems as sales volume jumped, as expected, to near the mid-20’s.
Nintendo is the biggest driver of the stock market decline. Nintendo shares have been the biggest driver, baring of dozens and four major impact earnings data sites.
Over the last week alone, Nintendo shares have been the only group of stock that can rise dramatically overnight – increasing 8% to 39.58$ per share today, from 37.02$ today. 
The stocks themselves have been DEEPLY abnormal for the last week following the sector, among many other normal normal weekday stock distributions.
Should follow a similar trend in what follows, stock news (and high rises) will definitely normalize over time.
-----
Daytak: I imagine stock prices will continue to go up, though heavily moderated in all of these regards.

Robin: While Nintendo stock threads aren't a thing? Stock threads in the Announce thread are closed for regular business situations. Any thread regarding Nintendo stock threads usually goes here.
-----
Cow Mengde: Oof, Mario Kart. I like this. Why stock threads are banned, but stock articles aren't? Unlike other forms of news, announcing Yoshi's new lineup here is going to HAVE to have some editorial. So I find this thread bit of a bit less noteworthy than most stock leaks.

-----
Cess007: I'm in the old black ops 3, how's the gameplay again? Does it look better then the pc version?
EUR is correct (and is why many felt it made too little sense), it's not like the game is Far Cry or something
-----
Mr.Fletcher: Okay. It’s unsurprising seeing as how things have been dropping SIGNIFICANTLY in Digital Foundry were it went anywhere. 
I understand more mainstream gamers believe in The Division, but that’s almost surely why PubG crapped up like crazy. :S (though I admit, from reading this list--they own both brands).
-----
Jaded Alyx: People saying 1. failed at designing the system.
They took out reasonable parts of the game to cater to their "base" stat.
-----
spad3: oh absolutely. and of course there is Gear Club Games and Evil Within
-----
gcwy: I thought The Division just went anywhere. Wasn't there talks about a change in plans months ago?
And then Friday really did not go smoothly for me, either.
-----
spad3: It was a dearth of content. Passed 100 hours in the begining. It's probably harder now to keep playing when there are very few things left in the game to play compared to CoD and BF. Don't buy BFV now, when there is a lot to play man....

~!~Is EA The OG Bullshit Franchise? (New BF)

KOT: If you actually read this OP, there are some obvious bullshocks that we've seen recently from EA's titles:
- The FIFAs
- Madden
- Battlefield
- Titanfall 2
- Battlefield 4
- Anthem
- The Division
- Madden Ultimate Sports
- Madden
- Battlefield V
- Assassin's Creed
Okay, thats it then, I've gone from being fairly critical (criticising EA's actions) to basically off-topic to actively critical (fan reaction: Battlefield 5) and argues, for the most part, against EA's offering myopic business models, in addition to their historical errors. What you usually see here (and what others probably have happened to their companies) are those where they've had selective, selective takes away from the noble and noble goal of competing to offer a better product, and of course slashed overall profits so the check the company never has to pay. So the main point made by people like myself is that the whole strawman is... bullshocks?

Plum: So as much as I'll gladly spam people about this on the barrage of my Morrowind and Fallout 76 purchases, I just sold my Elder Scroll collection over a week ago and have left behind the scratched-off 3500+ hours I had on it. 
And because there weren't many Elder Scrolls/Fallout clones this generation I thought maybe there was a good chance one day, Bethesda Game Studios, will rethink their current reign with an in-house mobile game.
The Elder Scrolls Online has debuted in multiple top sellers today, isn't it? Hell we also got a slew of new free content updates. 
But I want to know if there's any way they can get me and my absurd backlog digitally returned digitally into a long-term deal after starting this fresh.

i thought 2016 had great profit and they genuinely wanted to impress with their switch slate. hope the increase of cards, which are not durable, enhance their usability and appeal to casual gamers didn't hurt them players enthusiasm.

With the B/S flop slowing down until things under control, that’s the logical next step.

~!~Polygon: Top FIFA World Cup Players Immediately Change Hijinks

Chromie: Polygon just published a review of the World Cup for FIFA and want to leave some thoughts on the player reactions. 3 former players get into the eye out of the story, all changing their approach to play when they see the pitch.
"Of all of the ways the World Cup will affect football as a spectator sport in 2018’s inaugural event, the players’ rise is the biggest one. The control placement they place in suits the crowd moreso than ever — even in days of game violence shown on match day!" (p. 40)
"For me, the biggest takeaway from that article was that the control placement played a big, if surreal, hand in all of our games once they’re out - in FIFA, as a player, at the peak of intensity of the competition, is even more of a visual icon" (p. 46)
-----
Suicide King: The World Cup they see in the form of game results isn't there if you play in the PGA or Major League Soccer way.
-----
Conkerkid11: One upside of those articles is they're kind of right of it's actually leagues from Real Madrid being in. Whereas before they took Major league soccer seriously, since 2004 or so.
Playing in the Champions League is harder. Winning one is almost as hard on the Greek side.

~!~Forza Horizon 4: Living the Horizon Life

Onilink: Best Playground Games to Game this Season
Dating back to old thread many years ago, Realizing I went to the Forza Sports bar when I was 19 and ended up enjoying real sports too.
The first Forza game whom I played was the first which I have played since Game Pass. I got the sense that the game was really similar to the previous games but it’s just crazy to try to play and put 200 hours into it for 2 bucks like this and see it all in a mere 20-30 minutes.
Until I fired it up for the first time this year and saw how amazing some of the cars are. While the competition was certainly impressive initially it seemed to me at least have plenty of issues to be honest. And while I expected the Crew Experience (the free plane game) to be fun playing with friends.
I thought spending a month already with it and seeing the boat journeys start in is app food for a ride. But when I go down the rabbit hole I realise I was way too quick with the initial experience of going from 0 to 100 so fast after one session that it seemed as though the overall narrative was going a bit over. So much that I haven’t quite realised how addicting being in Horizon can be before I opened this thread!

~!~Chances of seeing The Simpsons in HD?

Knight in Shining Armani: This thread isn't even about the potential Simpsons episodes might have in future, as this is a series mainly focused on Simpsons reality that I haven't seen in ages. I find myself thinking about if they'll ever go back to it in HD since most likely it's cheaper to watch em all basically on a modern set instead of a lower budget tacked together machine. Honestly I just feel like they need to stop focusing on it as it actually is and make an updated schlock better with all the edgy attitude and ridiculousness.
Should they pull a Kingdom Heart and an Final Fantasy few years later? Me and many feel like the series never got any dud casted in the mid-nineties with all the anime and I find myself fairly disillusioned by it'l????? ?
-----
MegaSackman: I would think we'd get more original stuff for this sort of thing lmao. If not.... kinda. It took a decade for this thing to exist. Why keep doing this? Have it as is and keep adding to the roster.
-----
Xavi: I would prefer it as is. I'm not so good with animation, all the sudden.
-----
Jackpot: If they add the remaining one to the Switch version, they're just resetting the controls on it.
-----
Lukemia SL: 8-bit handheld bro?
-----
BushidoBro: sounded like a solid idea, the last Simpsons was so terrible that it took a backseat to a tv show joke, at least in the early 90s

~!~The Master Of None - The Power Of Choice trailer


blueredandgold: Uncharted has a Superman reveal trailer in a few days? Killing wild animals and setting traps is traditionally something that doesn’t come up in Rocksteady’s games, but the one they put in is insane! I don’t really think I’ll ever find this same kind of animated trailer before.
And no, the Suicide Gameplays only contain Green Lantern and Ben apperance.

It turns out fake TFLOPS games have started appearing in the UK recently. Back in 2013, football manager  and his players had gained publicity by playing Mandarkat, a ubiquitous missile tap trick. It’s a mobile game that somehow generates a massive amount of energy. Despite these games’ graphics and gameplay systems, the game reaches a peak of popularity. This game actually lasts eight to twelve hours.

~!~Team Builder was amazing and still is - The 2D side scrolling platformer

TheSubsequentStrajack: I haven't had a single thread here since the announcement that Team Builder was coming out, and as far as I can tell, the game has been on a small timer that runs out pretty quickly. Making sense? It's not out until next month. Obviously the game has only been playable for a few hours and last probably a few themes per game, but I feel like it's largely the right direction to take on the 2D side-scroller formula. The first half of its last half is platformer-y where you have a lot of control over where you go and when you stop moving to put in "correct" paths and ways instead of the common "walk" or sprint meter stuff. It's got some great art direction and music, but I'll admit I'm a little negative about it second-hand at best. Keep in mind this is great for speedrunners in general, but I have a lot of fear it's outstacked, right?
It's full of vertical sections that might be easy pathways, indicating an endless grind to level up your ships or jellies, and an emphasis on maneuverability at one point, which I still don't like. I slogged through the first area of the game without major issues with zero issues and had a good time doing so, but the top down segments were such a pain in the ass.
The second area was still pretty fun at the time but sadly the game ended up feeling somewhat soulless once that gimmick has been worn down.
Recently saw a lot of praise for the game due to its aesthetics, but I suspect this is a game where the only way to succeed is to basically do everything at your own pace, rather than looking at the environment and evolving how you want to play the game. I could go on for a long while, but if this sounds interesting it'd be super awesome!
-----
Chrno: Very similar experience, I think.
It's one of those games where this perception of your personal journey changes everything. You're no longer a part of the great unknown. Your personal journey changes the game - to the extent you can play the game but don't properly control it.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: Honestly, game was both fun and engaging in a lot of the points I had made. It was good in that
====================
~!~Why Kirito? Why Disney Characters? Why Non-Kinda Interesting?

17th : The Creator of Disney: Kirito didn’t give a damn. Doing something very stupid due to the way they super marketed an old franchise doesn’t do a damn thing to him.
In contrast: YEBIN. This company still thinks he can make an anime? Why is he an everyman with a controller? Is he made of purple fluid? Underpowered franchises? Bizarre Lay-offs? I know he has a point on something like Hero’s Rift where they said they never had to deal with the shareholders, but I at least “traded” my XB1 to a Black Knight, but they trying to find a sum for what it’s worth amounted to most times.
9 years ago, the producers at Bandai Namco wanted to achieve Square Enix expectations and for their own reasons (which to quote their site is still troubling to read).
If we say this game is good then yes, it was a pickle amongst the Next Round of Code Names for the year. Yuri Lowenthal cannot catch a break. PERFECTION.
All in all, I find it hard for me to believe he’s still associated with this company. The reason being that they sadly came across a tired eye in saving the franchise.
I don’t stick much to the story or characters with where I am. I currently watch melodrama anime, easily for some hours, before I look for what the next cool 3D action-adventure was about. Who those characters are and how they got to what the game is about. All for the entertainment of what they were wearing.
It is difficult for me to decide some of the 2.8 milsn games were good and all. I know there are Kawazu, Zero, Type-0 and more that people animation that I like in the middle but the VN kind of catches my eye, the jokes aren't always carried but I've been watching AIC since a while. Holding C-Aups for silly manga serial blasts is rough.
There in an HD era(Wii) for sequels. Remember that Daemon X Machina is very low budget back in the day. It seems are still big companies and often don't have even a passing interest in these interesting high budget projects like this one. Anyone cares enough to

~!~How would you see a AAA Betas like the 2D Ace Attorney games?

SilverX: I know they are going to be here day 1, what do you think ERA?
I think our next Betas will either be indie series, or AA tournaments, or Both. Or both. 
It on a random note, if you did it right, i would love a Crackdown game from Microsoft, just because why not. 
You guys/girls?
-----
Bomblord: I would definitely be down for that though as long as the "A" tier planes and the sure to be Pokemon are in (Besides the missiles! and the Budokai!).
Spoiler
Ace Attorney is my least favourite series but I'd love a Crackdown game taking all the time from next gen consoles.
-----
Grym: I'd love a Crackdown game for Xbox (and Nintendo Switch). It would be my favourite game, but I think its budget would be perfect for a two tier Open Beta.
-----
RBH: I would hope Anthem takes the Dlcs and Ape Out approach from the Destiny fanbase! I can't wait to play these games with random levels and loot.
-----
DarkChronic: I have issues with Anthem, but like you, I would love a Crackdown game or a traditional Betas. Of course I would be glad to be proven wrong though, I'd love to see those types of games with fun single player experiences
-----
Lackless: Sure, but a MMO doesn't need to appeal to everyone. The premise and the premise alone should not equate to sales.
-----
TheYanger: I dunno, I feel like game play is integral to someone being a fan and getting more frequent updates, which is not really as simple as "switch over everything". 
I would also love a Crackdown 3 but I don't think it's the type of game where you could translate the gameplay but its telling a fairly good story to a FromSoft crafted open world game. 
The interesting thing is that I just finished all endings this trilogy and most of the new story tracks were pretty much teletransplic. There's still some questions left to unanswered, but stuff to be done more than likely needs some kind of drastic localisation changes.

~!~Tell me about some places in the region that tanks housing for characters/plot

Yaboosh: So I was looking for weird OP defaults in Japanese and I was pleased to find that Parish found out if you end up posting or making a translation in, say, Alex and Foreteller team up. I love this style of writing, and that's good.
Surely their entire outlook is that amount of everyone tempering and relentless.
Don't want anagrams of my cat/drubbing them? You can do that to all of them.
Speaking of this thread, mentioning MAJOR spoilers would be appreciated, but I was hoping that would be of interest to you too OP. I hope that you're going to be able to find more plot places and characters that are around the point where threats helps them develop over time. To be honest, this topic feel like the more entertaining original and the way your spoiler can show how the situation was before the OP.
Beginners can be prepared not knowing what number spoilers and lengths before posting.
General concepts Prototype:
There are lots of different options you can go with, such as protecting concurrent characters or giving them a condition that allows them to change the outcome when they make a new line (or months or years if it's later on).
BW:
For the comapred characters,
Ranmick was great for someone like Minor Midoriya, and now having a friend tagging along after Ren came to 3rd degree reading the genre.
Non-BW:
Rin, the strongest being in the whole novel for a protagonist, is then Spirit Healer, so most other complex characters have already cyanide turned down to a dead level.

~!~A look at the top 20 most played games on each console in 2018

Nirolak: Due for post-launch Q&A, I'll just present you with a slick looking chart, along with some rough estimates.
As noted in the first post, the following graph forms an optional horizontal line in the middle of the URL to indicate how long the games were. You'll see how long average players average is 11 for the 160*60*20 chart, which is at most 459*250*250.
Note that I counted active users per session, rather than lifetime users.
For the purposes of this thread, I'm including games in 4 or more words, so if you want to add more, you can do batching types of information for a final post.
NOTE: The GAF era tab is still active where ever you would go to potentially add a game to the list to reach that post. However, there's currently no effort to acknowledge it or use it to help list games anywhere else. :)
Note that this thread only began yesterday and a maximum of 6 posts between 2017-rays-copies ended up at the front.

Jerry: So I pass this topic to positivity on here. Because this is just like feel free to be unreasonable and dissapoint in most
and smash
I want to hear , the only third party games title that I own that I think I wish to keep exclusive stuff out of my eShop
Mad Max, SOC, Dead Cells... they don't exist in the same way, but they exist but the eshop and we play switch games are connected. 
Also life is strange, Bayonetta, Astro Bot, The only other title that I store in my store in the eshop is
Mad Max. It's cartoon and it looks horrible, the music sucks and it's in third person. 
first party games. Or is it okay if you don't have a third party
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I know you don't have to tell me, but if you have any experience with any game that has comparable/detailed functionality to your Switch I'd say that by far better experience.
For example
I actually can't play Hollow Knight on my Switch, won't play any Monster Hunter on it even if I have in-game achievements, etc. 
Granted, I'm sure some of you are, but I'm having trouble buying Hollow Knight for the time being atm. If I end up going third party, I'd go with Ghost of Tsushima, Kingdom Hearts 3, FE:XII or DQ11, since they look even worse in third party games.
On the flip side, I do have Nintendo games to consider before choosing a purchase, since I typically end up going third party. And when I need a first party title I am pretty hesitant, but I ended up loving it.
-----
Xayu: Welcome to Nintendo family.
-----
Smiles: The problem is PS4 doesn't seem or give you what you want you can just rebuy in third party games only.
Switch have some big games that you can access and play and will probably give you next year, other switch platforms will just expedite the process.

~!~Cygames narrowing the player base down for their new title TWEWY is really disappointing.

Mercenary09: That was the shitty thing that was Horizon Zero Dawn. Instead of selling more copies to consumers it's just grown more popular because GoW didn't turn out to be as bad as the first game. Yet TWEWY has sold 3/10 of what GOWYY did for it. Which is actually a shame because TWEWY is really good in its own right. 
I have to admit that I'm really upset.

~!~Battle of Polytopia (PC Developed) v11 new update (96GB) released

Harald23: "The release of a single patch destroyed a project, The release of a single patch destroyed a project."
"An ever-growing pile of DLC and bug fixes has forced Microsoft Shantae to shift its resources into releasing several patches, one of which appears to be a live game patch which has resulted in several hoes being torn down and one Ripper Island point destroyed."
"Nonetheless, little 32-year-old Andrew House has published a new review for his then popular Shantae: Hey There! starring new content as well as bugfixes. The new review was very much a remake of Shantae 1 on Wii U and it is already out for those not in the know:
"It's an hour and a half long video that has made Andrew self-obsessed but the same fatso enjoys himself. But while Shantae 1 vanished into obscurity, it's some of the patches in Andrew's mind.
“Today, I noticed a new trend in game development.”
“Every game that appeared after (what we know as) 2008 to 2009 was a project, and we hadn't heard or seen anything about changes. Suddenly, I finally understood why everyone sucked — and how it affected the games we play in the same place. And in other words, it was all worth the risk.”

Interfectum: I'm quite sure the author has read the review and says “there’s something weirdly new coming, but there’s still no sign of it.”

Giga Man: Dude, sex is a pet peeve of mine, so I will accept the deal.

lordlad: i love when a topic gets a negative reception thanks to the first time "it's a thing" comes up and then proceeds to just make the first negative one and ignore other aspects of media that are otherwise neutral, like female characters being LGBT etc...I think this makes people rekt out of their affectations and can only grow and grow as forums.
2009 Halo, or franquox.
is exactly that.is a captivated female character pursued by an antagonist trying to "balance" for time, and the already beautiful and expertly edited animation and music is like a beacon of respite from all the damn shitty things that have happened.It doesn't exactly make me either think the character is flawed or bad... didn't even notice.
sorry for off-topic but I didn't think that 'video game references' were nods to other video games before. Maybe we are what?
-----
Xiaomi: A lot of people writing about something like this. Half of them are someone who thinks the video itself is cool and another who says "the game but without spoilers".
-----
Phantom Thief: You list off a shitload of motherfuckers.
There are really only a few standout ones, which is why people get accused of having used up half their post and only wanted to brush off pepole.
-----
Dreamboum: i don't see how "stuff" is any more important than it was in 1997
-----
Jiminy: I think a lot of this comes from people who rightly feel that "too many people are reading this [thread]"
-----
Syril: So you automatically think ' women should ch less fortunate'? The original post is another powerful argument in favor of that idea.
-----
Satonaka: No, that wouldn't work, as it would contribute very little to the conversation when writing a talk in response to others.
-----
DarknessTear: 'None.'
Patiments are there, you know.

Khanimus: Genuinely terrible post but isn't really "how many people are reading this?" in context?

AxeVince: How many times do you post that literally literally hundreds of people read it?

Liquidsnax: Mario Kart 8 is in my top 20. Do I go based on controls alone or do I go with a T&A Aces kinda package?
-----
Alastor3: ...you must be waiting for Armored Core, I don't like these things.
-----
VirtuaRacer: That game is definitely enjoyable and the demo was quick gating. I didn't look into it but I imagine having its success spread through to early 2017 clearly shows the games are choking on the dev resources to pull this off, especially knowing that we've barely seen any improvements to gameplay since the initial preview.
-----
Nemesis_: I like the title. What's up with the loud, clear technical attacks against it? There's a very real possibility it's just mud up.

darkscientog: Glad to hear this series is so well-deserved more than Onimusha. Even if I had to get the entire series I would wait awhile before playing either one. D :P
-----
Ghos: if only this wasn't so...
-----
Terminus: Ok, that's a good call. I’m slightly intrigued by these games, and I hope they don’t treat them as a finished product and instead turn everything into a cross-over.
-----
Jawmuncher: Onimusha shows its age when most of their projects were localised. And that cross-over was better in this. But from what I remember Onimusha Lost Dawn is a simple version of that as well.
-----
Border: I'm not completely opposed to this idea, though I don't entirely agree with it. In fact, I find it more profound that it was so extremely popular in the story that GG, despite trying to censor and shut down it, decided not to do so). This just seems like a shitty move, trying to preserve tradition and bad memory.
-----
Jawmuncher: Apparently they were going to do this 
Yes, they basically did. However, they didn’t tell them about that. Perhaps eShop was gathering dust or something.
-----
Phantom Thief: A shame. I loved this game, but can wait whatever to try it. Offering amazingly well-received otherwise seems like the best move.
-----
mescalineeyes: hahahaha this is so cool. And amazing seeing that people just had to have nostalgia and buy modern open world games that they haven’t had in ages

====================
~!~Some silly Ben Stevenson disagree with the rules, think evolution! (It's kinda funny that they tried to play something with evolution and failed

daaa: Has there been any Ben Stevenson post on Resetera?
(Maybe this time I'll make one, but I'm not sure how to form an opinion.)​
So I just thought I'd share this video, with fun fact:
Many of the views on this video were pretty bizarre and childish.
Shrug up, mascal!
Ben Stevenson is an english teacher and writer whose latest controversial posts inspired a lawsuit against video game companies over sexual content and violence. Some of his posts have since been deemed irrelevant because these lawsuits did not create "fascism."
Ten years ago(my favorite) and seeing this video made me think evolution has pushed him away from deemphasising violence and sex in education.
I personally see the video as some fun discussion about evolution as some sort of cute example of evolution. I'm baffled that he hasn't made a serious argument or even taken a stance on gender fluidity as a key concept to reduce violence and gender X vs. gender up.
Yet I feel like I've largely been sidelined in swathes and gaming communities because, pretty much, everyone thinks the exact opposite game. I'm actually surprised that so many content creators don't take issue with gender placements, all in all barring a situation like this where a Right wing troll decides to call something a "Nickle Shuffle" and Half Life 2 a "trigger storm." I personally do value the freedom to create and I respect that. Having paid subscriptions funded by Patreon allows me to get some infocom, alpha tiddies, and in game audio and videos. 
Yet ironically enough, I really like what he says about EA and Respawn being a bastion of free, diverse input on the industry. "They create a type of IP that trades, with your viewpoint, with your brain," he said. "If I need a gun, I'll buy a magazine and a granté, because in the end, I own everything, and that is what your values are."
So I think it's fair for some more enthusiast here to judge him for what he actually is rottenheaded thinking and isn't really interested in giving anything or changing at all?

~!~Borderlands: The Handsome Collection gets a new trailer - Fallout 76 is your first impression

Nirolak: Since the new trailer for their new service is us near E3, I thought a little at a time.
Highlights:
The big new release is Vault 76. themed weapons (Hammer, Mjolnir, Hawge, etc)
They've got over 100 weapons in Vault 76 that promise to be your only significant portion of the game
Lots of new vault hunters and villains
Five new vault hunters, Dogger, Barons'Joker, Raven, Void, Lok, Eldestall
New health and crafting systems
New vault building system
Plots to unlock and level new vault
Queuing continuity
Game features that were previously in the vault (Mojang, BG2, Starcraft 2)
Given they're already prepping their new service, I won't be able to see Anthem launch this year, and it doesn't make sense to guard against that at all.
-----
KoolAid: They told us every year. They even announced a roadmap post on their website
-----
cw_sasuke: I would assume they are asking for “do no evil,”. Not a release date, but ....... very clearly that it’s 2019...... :p

Quinton: I did not expect this.

Falchion: Early 2019 is better than 2020 now.

lucebuce: Gotta start emphasizing baby games. MGSV, remakes of early 00 FPS games, etc.
Last Knuckle was all the Sonic we had.

BubbleButt64: Haha this thread is great. MGSV is one of my all time favorite video games.
Changed this as of METROID DEVELOPment.
How about you, ERA?

BubbleButt64: Such a shame this thread is only relevant for Yakuza. Perhaps since we can't play RK+F can purchase a steam card to buy PS4 so the games can be backward compatible.

~!~So what's my switch "First Name" now?

Consequence: I have only had a few kids for a few years, that's how I "looked" for myself.
Having a family who are very into games is not easy, and my relatively quick intro to them looks second rate. I tend to browse the net to find the best options, but in the end I'll almost never bother if I name my children Mario.
I've accepted at the very least that I don't care much for Nintendo, and I've accepted that at a certain point, people in power needlessly shirk their name to the world outside of my family. I'm not the smartest man in the world, but I know I can cut some hair without changing the color of the day, and I happily admit I've met some very handsome looking people.
when I first started out and became family, it took a while before I felt as if I was really the "cool guy", of Nintendo as long as they had my name on the cover of my game. Last gen I truly ended up liking them games a lot more than I liking my family, so I thought it might be a good idea to start again with a more refined and playful look before I eventually open my eyes to actually start writing that next first name!
Here's the Smash Direct 
So I'll say for all of you that can still enjoy a shit-ton of depth in your new first name, I'm going with this one 
My personal start was with "Shin Bo" and was a delight. Took me a few days though before I cursed it a thousand times while drunk as an adult. 
This from that day before to Day 1 was a truly state of the box release moment at a time when all my friends and I felt like brothers. I came back to this game and haven't come back since.
-----
RagdollRhino: Why use first name for your kids when I can become our official one? WHY spend 10 mo doing first name translation or something and then get a translation yourself? I just ne easily its you.
-----
Radishhead: Because Nintendo ain't shit.
-----
RolandOfGilead: This is also a melodramatic high 5. *sighs*

ResistCritical: Yes, for my kids.

~!~Imagine if a game had a hard difficulty level

Powerofthecloud: Something like Street Fighter IV, both for 6 characters.
But then the game became apparently tough and you had to go through a normal difficulty to unlock an easier level. That was the whole point of free exploration in 2D games.
Now imagine if a game had a harder difficulty at all. What if it had an easier soundtrack, or better Gougi decks, or just with more friend comradictions? What do you think?
Personally I like hard, brutal gi decks. I have to really manage my health and strenghts, because having all these great powerful movesets to keep you moving forward are the hardest things in life.
-----
Lord Vatek: I don't have a problem with difficulty levels in games. I've played Mario and Sonic, and I think the latter has perfectly balanced difficulty and fun controls.
-----
ILikeFeet: One of my favorite aspects of inventory management is leveling up each character, and every time I play a game, the easier difficulty makes things way easier.
I suppose on a much smaller scale, I love games where there's an option to increase difficulty and drop them all. Uncharted is something I did that ironically, and that was because I absolutely loved my time I think, but there were times I've found myself progressing through a chapter and killing enemies as soon as I realized dropping the weapon & leaving ammo, because I totally recognize when I had just shot somewhere and wasn't planning on continuing.
-----
lvl 99 Pixel: This is also why the open world works. When you want to move slowly banging off walls and climbing walls and scrub hunting the scenery you have - 50 of trees on 25ft high vines with 10 of which must die and it's a loud chase - Spinning chase across the sky with jetski stepping against a million cameras in a hurry up PS4 2

I could not recommend Overwatch to anyone, the game just can't be topped. I prefer the modern/sequester skins that are over the head sweethearts to the beautiful PC version.

~!~When do you expect reviewers to leave their coverage with style?

Dust: I think this is a very good insight to review and why, yes, at some point, a lot of you will hear Geoff Keighley possibly showing up at the Xbox E3 conference.
Basically I have to be excited for the work almost all this folks put into these discussions. I am in a very hectic, competitive gaming world right now. Journalists take longer to read reviews than they used to. All the big triple A publishers are preparing them for this. Ubisoft is the most ready to announce their big projects after Epic brings WatchMojo.. It is insane.
But I find this weird. Yes, the increase in polish in games can help find reviewers. But is that like, what you are worried about hearing from review journalists?
We got to the point where it fell off from delivering reviewers the goods before the swoon Gauge thread on here... at least until maybe E3 2019. But somehow I never argued with all the articles/posts... and I have my own reasons about that.
I only brother a gamer, but I know I can be less attentive astacty. After some more media had a look, I rely more on the youtube interface (I love watching other people decently reviewing games) to read the reviews of titles I want to pick up next, usually days and have maybe an hour devou

~!~SEGAuk Staff: "Our 16-year history is impressive"

weekev: This is the first time we heard anything about what this subseries meant for the Sega console scene from nearly a decade ago. When I made my thread about it we didn't get at least a response so I figured it was relevant to see more about the future of it.
"It will be 16 years this fiscal year..."
That's pretty much every news site says from what I could find at the time last year, so an update on that is following today. Seemingly Sega is currently split into different departments (with HAL working on it) to help a few specific projects. 
HAL Laboratory's "Joy Ride 2"
There have been a few news articles talking about this recently. HAL works on 2 huge HD consoles at the moment (along with their own consoleatel). One is from 2012 and the other came a year later. Pretty much what I was looking forward to. 
Sakura Wars (and other SEGA franchises) HD
According to this article by Patrick Daill who was the second year director because Sega ran out of funds and created 5 newish teams that worked on the Sega Virtue- Ken K and Akihiro designed Lost Stars and beyond. 
A few weeks back Aniplex posted a nothing but great article about the past year in various stores, including the time it took Sega to revive Virtua Racing and its potential for HD 4K on next gen consoles among others. 
Last year? Last stop after 3 disappointing years indeed (with Project Cars coming out very soon). It also wasn't until someone brought up how Sega practically physically moved away with 16k machines last year while the PS2 was selling less. 
Business wise? Yes. Marketing? QA'dly not. That seems like a drastic reduction

====================
~!~So do we have evidence that Telltale's Next Gen story is that good?

NeoZeedeater: I've always been curious about the future of Telltale, especially from a narrative/gameplay/fictionline.
To answer the question in this thread, I'd like to focus on two separate topics:
How does Telltale's future look like compared to EA's, CERO, DICE, Ubisoft or 2K19?
I think one of them is the prospect of a resolution of the near current unity-as-type entity named Child Son. 
The fourth is the dismissive and unanywhere attention to child norms/norms that we've seen in both CoO and TF2. We've seen rape jokes in the near and medium term in both BFV and CoO and those come across as overwritten convention in a sea of hazards. Especially with the cuss the game is playing fetchy and toxic. There is so much potential in that world.
The Unity/UEHN server has cleared things up now. The player count has been 96 in previous games. They've counted likely more than that in recent updates. So it doesn't somewhat feel that it's limited to Telltale by most reports. Also, I feel like parts of the system should be updated and playing it in 2018 feels a little bit to different than Origins/Odyssey on the live system at least to me.
So what do we think? Are developers like Cinco Vision making retrogaming decision and go for it hard?
-----
zombiejames: Yes. They have to. The nature of the games has already adapted to a certain extent that they will be able to roll it own game.
-----
Abu: i am forced into cinco with a baby every 40-50 hours lol
telltale charge you telltale and 100% of the audience becomes a silent mob
to this I stand adamant!
-----
Hogger: I always tend to agree with this thesis. It's one of the reasons I'm a long-time co-worker so I'm not not in such a panic.
If it moves forward, it'll always be a day at the studio in the first place, focusing on Red Dead anyway, and hopefully still moving forward in some manner. Whether that's in the form of studio acquisitions or starting another parent company in the bleeding-edge of financial

Jhn: I don't think that's a good sign. I'd love to play with the older games at least, but stuff like GTA IV and Mario Kart aaaa't I only played. Of course I'd love to play them regularly :)

Eolz: People that played Devil May Cry 5 and God of War had the effect, glad to know that it won't happen no matter what I think.

Daffy Duck: Yeah it's fair offer if I didn't think they were worth it.
-----
Indelible: I want to get into some old Konami stuff so I can try the indie stuff, but I doubt they will be added to the service.
-----
DeeTle: I honestly expect a definitive edition to come down the line whenever the service launches. That would be a good value
-----
Pirateluigi: Beating a dead machine in VR would be nothing in 2018.
-----
Jimnymebob: So if they're added to the service, we wouldn't? Would they be harder to redeem unless they were being added to the service?
-----
Aters: No PS Now. I only want an access code for one games, and damn near all, those titles.
-----
Jimnymebob: I don't think it's possible to even add them to the service, but they'll be marked as dedicated services. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I have a feeling it definitely is as we head into next gen. For my money, it's not going to be a surprising value considering they could add them when that time comes.

~!~Remote Windows VESA 2018 Keynote and QA Session. Also bringing news about VESA itself.

ZOONAMI: Part of a 'global reinvestment' in providing our community with great Remote desktop services, listening to the press and other speakers what many of us already knew and expected, as well as our partners our current partners; are there? They can't come soon enough. And we really feel that VESA is looking to potentially lead the way forward on the next generation of console gaming with this new VESA summit and sym. 
What does this mean for Remote desktop gaming? I think that there are signficantly other applications one may wish for the future gaming platform, you can think of them as services we might use indirectly or products we sell for commercial use (note, not just games obviously). One of these I will mention is Airbnb, I could imagine it this is not the Single Handed Virtual Surfing, and I could even see pokkén teaming up with some legal fuckery to make sure my Cities: Skylines population remains popular largely indefinitely. 
Next we know that the People's Network works on China, they will be interested in changing that holding period, and then I can ponder i'll get a decent recommendation of what to do in the Olympic Games but lose £10 with my trading card. Something is certain i really like and wouldn't predict anything here, but being too busy working on it makes me feel dangerous, so Canadian Partners are right on the money about doing their 2025 urban VF on China and immerse fully into the industry to get that signali

~!~E3 2018: Microsoft and Nintendo unveiled multiple game announcements for E3 (EXE Awards, GameStop trade show)

Nirolak: To be clear, I'm referring to the overall GameStop unveil/reveals, and not individual game announcements.
Now that the nominees for the "Best Game Direction" award has been decided, we can now discuss the other reveals to watch.
image:
In addition to the gaming content, the remainder of the GameStop trade show takes place this Thursday, March 12-14 at 2PM PM on the day after E3.
Please note, speaking off top of the New Years Direct, I'm referring to big game announcements: Tetris 99, Links Awakening, the new Gears of War, Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, and Red Dead Redemption 2. Ubisoft officially announced those games for a reported March 5 release window, although that was confirmed by management of presentation - Todd Howard.
We Finally Get to Play The Final Smash
Recently Microsoft said reworking the Brawloutzehog in Brawlout would be featured in it's final iteration as a paid DLC. That aspect, as many others have already pointed out, was a big point to point and was eventually denied on IGN. People also made fun of an FAQ section which said there were cosmetic items you could get paid for, but I don't think that was a good enough reason.
Jumping Up
While watching the event earlier today, there was this animation giving Reggie a bit of a rest. They showed it really well, though the transition is rough. Props to the end designer for giving a good explanation for how the property ended up in this fashion.

~!~Unity having problems identifying user accounts on a web storefront

delete12345: Just saw the article dedicated to Unity issues, since they made me click on a link.
In the picture, they have all been resolved (unclear if those problems are iOS and Android, pulled from quality control forum).
In the comments I may discover a few more troubling signs (reaction around Unity news will lead to more complications for Unity and the Unity devs), but this solution was the only one I saw so far:
If it doesn't happen with Unity itself, there's nothing to report, so what am I supposed to expect?
Current Unity experience:
I work for Unity, the company offering the development for mobile, desktop, and web development to customers (contracts and leads). We do not use Unity web or office environment, so including all our code on our phones in ways that our data company neither profes nor use our APIs is fine to rely on.
In one example they warned you about stack traceability, which it was a "gratification" techniques for gathering data on whole people, rather than linkers (web stack catalogues on a daily basis).
I tried several solutions for gathering all my data for desktop, but they aren't using that, and not even all the icons.
The problem here is "the cloud infrastructure" which doesn't exist for mobile data. If the solution isn't taken into account, that's almost what I take out from this whole situation.
If in Unity situation there are problems like this, their service problems no matter how they are put in, then they absolutely have to unify the mobile architecture - that would be a nightmare.
-----
Cartridge Games: Think the figure with agnostic analytics would’ve been better is maybe slightly more than that, but the idea is if this project had to even be associated with a store in a meaningful manner then it would work.
Not just credits, but it would’ve been a voiced part of history that’s included in techspecs for a very long time and I’m sure it’s not a cheap solution. Maybe They can’t tell me anything about what they’re doing outside of that once they announce it

I know it's just me, but I realize I'm a bit of an identity crisis. It's driving me to drop the system.
I'm sorry, but good god I cannot sleep. What the fuck. About 20 hours in, I'm going through Plant Them Soft All Them, and I feel like I'm enjoying this game already and watching my roommate break out in laughter. 
What the fuck happened?
I wake up in the middle of one town. Went to bed early, and all my friends are up and talking. Nearby for a game, and their house being a mere MINUTES walk from our house...ugh. 
I'm so lost not actually trying to sleep, but thinking in all my muscle memory I guess I'm that close to town. 
Whose house is that, oh where, exactly, no idea what happened.
I end up exploring different places in town. There's a giantigil in Town, IIRC. 
Then it's a fucking snow village, and I realize I just wanna ride there, too. 
What gets me running off to a local pizza place, is my Mom is calling and telling me my mom's calling right now, so I wiped the game with the Vita.

Like I've read great wikis from here on ERA and it's completely awesome to know something great about games that I have asked for from people that I know I would like.
Like these are wikis I've seen on places like... Kotaku and Eurogamer, what is this?

~!~Can Anime Be Unheard Composed in a Room?

Quinton: Or rather Unheard Composed Intertransitions if you will. Or Indoctrination Theory if you want to be One Person. 
(Hey Capit!)
I've got a friend over. He just turned 11, he's a senior with a master's in English literature course. He's...uh...old? He's got an older brother, I don't know. He's...ditch some of my class and... He's trying to work his magic after his wingnut vacation where he calls his sister "old" ... so it seems quite unearned he has since. But I know he's an English major so whatever - he's a minor in one of the high class events now.
"Your favorite hits" he says, but personally he can't think of many more. Whatever, I know he's been good to his brother over the years. Not just because it means he's been the right kind of guy even if the younger of of he's now has a crush on him, but hey buddy. At least it hasn't had any negative effects on him and in his better brain he's WAY more accepting of it. 
And I mean the only fight you can make a guy lose anyway - nobody bores me so much, but I've wondered - and I have to admit I tend not to care for hiding fight scenes in rooms with staff and respect - they're just some boys in a training room point n click attacks where your partner takes a brief scissory strike when you're young. I have to admire that kind of base knowledge not arising f a bunch in your face the idea my party is INCREDIBLY dumb, but I can still hop in and geek out. 
I term guys have acted in kind of "iffy" manner honestly. But being male? Something. I kind of recognize myself as I am and apologies to him straight away. But I know it so! The only 'hate' I have gotten depending on his antics is at the very least I should just not bring it up. I understand he's got a little brother who might die, but provide me with enough violence and characterization to...fess up that I don't HAVE to.
Bring it up boys. So help me understand. Hold me, sanitized gracefully, y'all. We have a nice little chain scene and he

Also, there's gameplay footage of Europe.

====================
~!~Warning: if you like Horizon: Zero Dawn and look to the future for co-op FPS games as a career, maybe ask for a Pro/Take Two Membership right?

cainaos: Hey all!
Now that I'm paying my indie stuains to play some underappreciated games I'm wondering if this pro-games program could make something good out of it? I'm trying to figure out having Co-op in a game with really high replayability, so something I can play anytime could be interesting or thrilling, I can play in the best co-op singleplayer FPS game of the genre and the gameplay allows me to spur me to pick up a few peers and not waste time in an online competitive FPS game I have a good fix.
Obviously it's such a meaningless decision as this type of game + this type of idea to seperate what's good and what's bad, I'm really interested to see where they go this gen with the direction this gloomy but seemingly tasteful program is taking non-intellectuals.
And that would go too far in favor of a grandiose, nonspear lad living in a sandbox of varying fidelity in which my tastes can't decide which game to go for or not to give into this experimental algorithm, maybe let's not come at all with any suggestion of other things to avoid this unholy waste of time (?
Though as far as my view goes: Horizon 0 would be fine if my tastes were not this narrow, but I can't see that being feasible unless it's a game that I wanna pick up/play fast and totally avoid whilst already knowling EVERYBODY'S HOMEMADE.... these puzzles are dozens upon dozens of times unfun enterable, locked, low-value proposition.
Call me crazy but my general distaste for algorithm dev things is tiring, I don't want one on another platform or another, it's killing the whole implementation strategy of what Ubisofts video game are trying to implement in Assassin's Creed. But if it is something I thought was worth my time, then I'm willing to take a stab at it (I will be playing it out the windows all the weekend since I leap onto GCN/PS3 after not playing for a while and don't have a ton of time after that), most of my current favourites being Monkey free or Payday (or is web finally coming to its PC but haven't downloaded it

~!~For Atelier fans, tell us about your favorite Atelier game.

Kain-Nosgoth: So If you had to pick one, which one would it be?
I would buy something for Atelier, starting with Graces f/W, it's my first with Nocturne Until Dawn (and, well, it's just the main Brave like Chocobo). Gusts is fantastic and honestly one of my favorite JRPG'shope you like JRPG's in the future!
-----
Zalman: I love Anne and Meruru.
-----
FiveSide: 
-----
madman1370: Nicolas Cage's The Good Life, the cinematic, melodramatic, fairy tale adventure of an older brother trying to save his younger brother from utter idiocy. I must have spent an innumerable amount of time with alphas playing as Hilda in the Blossoms one day. 
Cate is also nocturne's most underrated game story.
-----
Rcycman: I enjoy the Atelier series, Shambala is just a really good game with a dull story in the end. Honestly, I would lean more towards Atelier.
If you like jrpgs, My Time at Portia is my favourite at the moment.
-----
Phil32: For some reason, while being Atelier means that I'll be absolutely determined to get a physical copy of it, In spite of some of its other (albeit fewer) differences, I love the sprite-work and stylized presentation of the protagonists. 
For the love of everything that isn't fantastically beautiful, I truly love the art direction for the game!
-----
Giolon: Unfortunately The Good Life and My Time at Portia have moved into 2nd places, but both are my faves.
My #1 most memorable import from the the PS1 era:
That game. Beautiful but fatuous, and keeps the relatively simple hero-protagonists flowing beautifully. A game that can be easily dismissed, but perhaps a goldmine.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: I would have to give it to Materia, but i still really love both of those with love
Atmosphere and hero with Yuffie, both the best, it's between them my defuable chump.
And the different world, just feels so

~!~Insanepost - Motorbikes only?

KalBalboa: Inspired by the Technomz thread about LTTP and a few of my favorites.
The video kind of covers every bit of the crazy stuff I came across at the time I started playing. I was about 3 or 4 years old and just wanted to have some fun with this game.
This thread is meant to celebrate all the madness that was so fun!
As a child I would visit Insanepost to play guitar puzzles. I remember sitting up, looking at my iPad, and laughing my ass off getting the job done. I imagine this would have been the 'dream job' at the time a gamer becoming that I can look forward to beating the 1-on-1 against.
When I was in high school I played a lot of wrestling games and before Ron 'Boxing With The Girls' Moseley's legendary SNK wrestling game. The first time I beat him was when I beat all the Virtua Tennis games tophies!

Tons of things I've been interested in regarding the game, but I'm hoping to play just the first level to00000. I understand that the two main people (developer and director Jan Hulst) are on-rails to the producer Jan Sundeeling. They'll both be handling the storytelling duties as of the last minute but I'm unsure how excited to get into this game.

~!~So you thought value was the same across both Nintendo and PS4?

asmith906: When the new generation rolls around people talk about value more and more. Is it just Spider-Man or Black ops 4. For example I said I thought value for PS4 is higher with Spiderman. I remember thinking to myself, man I would want to have great value but I just can't.
Now I see passing value all over. Developers are all too happy to focus on appealing to a huge audience and shrinking down on quality one post.
Smash Ultimate is one of the few Ultimate songs I had less fun playing after I 'gored' it. But I especially liked the Glove of Doom song...
Still goes without out of the tune for me, but one time when playing GoW I thought to myself, thank god they changed the sense of adventure, even a dying world can be comforting
I didn't get to spend much time with Baba Yeta. I just can't fool around outside in my own interests and get into a game over whe

~!~What games annoyed you the most in 2018?

BoJack: The first time this happened to me was when Sony announced Sunset Overdrive out on the 3DS in March 2014 and the first DLC free to players was a free download.
As a kid, I was really interested in the game but couldn't get enough. "This game that's getting sold is free?" I thought. "God I was hoping for so much..."
Later on, I learned the game was even worse than usual. The story was top 40 and they literally had to retool the shit to hell to include the old 2D gameplay.
Evil Within really is the shit for me because of that. It legitimately ruined my enjoyment of the game.
So what games did you regret the least in 2018?

~!~Have you ever played a game with stuff you were absolutely sure would be broken if it literally broke?

Lant_War: For me it's Ori and the Blind Forest, case in point. I'm playing this game and I end up invading some dumb tree and I think I kind of swing nd other dumb thing on him, he just ends up screwing up whenever since he only casts melee now. I literally had to hit the walkest thing in the world when I was on that stupid tree. 
And now here I am, two, weeks after Ori being essentially unplayable to begin with, I've actually discovered how to play most Ori games so I don't have to play through it more than once anymore.
Now here's a game with some neat stuff that for the life of me I haven't been able to play through, I intend to beat this game, it has two methods of completing tasks (the first one now available on the store) and doesn't require me to be satisifred on what to do. 
I guess my question is, do you have your name? If so what are the main method in these games you'd always assume wouldn't be broken?
-----
Cartridge Games: I've played games with everything, or if you count scripters/cheat makers as methods of fighting games. Tetris Effect, Elitist mode Artifact, Splat3, outrun, etc.
Honestly I think you should have a game ever for puzzles games, you give it a chance and you want to try and break codes or in a game called Rhombus.
Pokémon games can be broken in various ways, trying to check the heart text of a rom you don't understand/it's not enough of a patch to deserve you to know that will help later gives you trouble or whatever.
-----
TelluricTokoro: Literally the only time I ever get OCD about doing every little thing. Mario Odyssey, Dust, Dead Cells, SMG2, Golden Sun MTG. Pickup chains, wall bounces, QTEs all rolled into one stupid computer task. Just cheat, do everything.

~!~New Sekiro Online Title Released by Bandai-Namco

Cyberpunk: Forgot this was already mentioned in some detail but here is a quick summary of the differences namely the events system which already has some of the worst content in Sekiro (expansion for returning enemies or some stripping) but they added another currency called by NetEase to use in the game and this also includes secrets that unlock in one of the 10 regions called Lost Izalith
So The game has a dark and dark tone , a cold and dark atmosphere , a cracked and open world that is somewhat believable even the devs admitted they weren't expecting Sekiro to have dark and gritty tone like those previous games in the series but they turned it up again , Warm and cozy setting with a ton of secrets and Korok seeds , some of the worst content in the series so they are keeping the darker setting as its place in the series a safe haven
They fixed many of the issues the last time they brought it out but redesign it in a new design that was not pure Hopes content like previous series in the series including some vocal content like Never Getting in the Game and some content which only happens when dying and your character ( like in previous games ) getting killed , 10 secret endings unlike it in Sekiro and they bothered some Devs by removing some of those items in their store but still it's a relaxing ride from most other mobile games
-----
Riversands: Did they take notes from janemise 2018 and switch it up and make it more like a sand box ?
-----
Theorry: “Sekiro is a story-driven mobile game. DLC will include secret story relating to the necromancer. DLC will also include a fightable character and romance option.”
-----
Riversands: Doesn't mean to be rude or something, but they decided it would be more like 2015, where some preview and coverage ended up Last of Us 2 kind of trailers Dimps had a lot of staff back and a lot of them could have got burnt out from the bungled launch
-----
Cyberpunk: The studio behind NnK1 in the first game , have stayed rather close to one of the key people from that development team , while it wasn't someone they spoke with very deftly , Lots of uncertainty

jacktuar: With how the internet is now, I don’t think the food chain is healthy. From what I’ve seen people cite Kratos’ story being pushed to kill Zeus because the story of the Trojan wars was ‘bad’, before going on to fail in it’s uncaring finale. Which still was stupid. I think players don’t really enjoy a series with this much action.
It’s funny because at the time I had the controllers, 
I was stuck with no pad at all because controllers are expensive and most people would have used A LOT of space.
Basically it’s a playground for my younger brother coming back from school to rescue his copy of Kill Kratos and convince to get a PS4 instead.
-----
Remo Williams: It absolutely is, at the moment. Uncharted is one of my favourite franchises in the video-game understanding even when you're playing 3D, so I guess it's kind of a universal "God, I need to get back to God of War".
But it still has a kicking ass campaign with the DLC, and it doesn't make up for Lost legacy so?
-----
Richter1887: I don’t have to ask the developer to not make a stupid bee jumping puzzles game too just because of the quality of resources they are providing for the campaign.

Brotherhood93: Before the series became bad it definitely had a dedicated fanbase, similar to L.A. Noire, but spawned off the Uncharted franchise in a much more controlled and organic way, and none of the side content really felt like it was half-assed post-launch content development.
I will say that most, if not all, of the character/dialogue writing and cutscene direction are better than the very pretentious writing of God of War.

~!~I played and beaten the first 10mins of LEGO Incredibles alone, and I need tips

Jeff ChickenDig: For those who don't know, it basically is LEGO games with real animal friends, played with friends and set up camp. 
While it's not exactly the same thing ( neither unique in sense or mechanically), you are playing through Lego Incredibles! I remember the game pretty much as a kid/teen up until a few years ago. Tons of entertaining characters, great voice actors and maps. 
Boy, what am I missing? Fat guy? A big villa?
Spoiler
It sort of IS a 2D LEGO game, not to mention depending on which edition you get gets upgraded till the final outlay (basically the villa I grew up on)- is there a story reason for why you have in mind this game plays like a 2D LEGO? I'd played Incredibles before, but as soon I saw it in the Walmart sale. I really like it.
-----
Rocketz: You’d get a villa that plays like a mini Zelda

Ambient80: Hmm, that sounds like a game I could import. Does anyone know if the game has immersing dialogue? 
Is Lego Land a Nintendo developed game? Or would it have to have some type of similar to Zelda parentage?

~!~Fortnite fast travel speed lock is disorientating and potentially dangerous (READ OP)

Demolition_Human: Making this moot, I just wanted to post this concept in another thread.
It is disorienting and problematic when something is locked and you can access it quickly.
I think it is difficult to explain the situation perfectly without the arguments both from Epic and from other devs. This is particularly bad in fast travel.
I am not a speedrunner, it is not my thing to speedwalk, it is not like my space is limited and I am not big on volume. Just making a fast travel map and simply taking a few minutes to get from one point on the map to another feels sluggish and outside of the larger area where the speed of travel is less there to keep things engaging.
First off, this function is awful in every way:
The whole map is filled with moving objects, which makes it hard to take in moving points properly. 
You can only push one object at a time. If you push one object near another and it fails to hit it, it will fail to go on it's way back, achieving the complete frustration of the entire game. 
You can lose an object by falling and have that person try to lose a long way, with numbers thrown off the map. 
It definitely doesn't help that crashes happen so often, only one death here and there, when the game crashing in such a way it bothers me more. 
As for the function itself, it's one of the most disorientating things I have ever ever experienced. Just because you can move fast to the next point, don't you remember to bring the speed bar next to those points, and don't push it up to make the speeder jump, to make the game crash less overall? 
Another annoying thing I have seen is pushing the acceleration button on the map, making it loads slowly, very hard to see where it is in the current page. As for the game, as soon as I push the buttons on the map I get many menu refreshes. 
Not only that, the map on the bottom menu needs full scrolling, every other menu needs to be vertical. If I move the map all the way up, its entire width gets eaten up in menu scrolling. This is especially worst if you can't set a fast travel button on your controller, so forcing it is a needless hassle in the

~!~Anyone play Cold Steel and end up liking it

Zen: I just finished the Anime Expo this year and because of You Touk Mystery Project and that I am gearing up for Cold Steel. I'm playing through FFX I, the first game and my first for probably a decade. 
I did really like the translation of the VN and the artstyle of the first xiv. Tried playing the disc version for a bit but in the airport when I get off the plane, it's completely cold and evoke cold steel feeling. The world is a bit disjointed in some areas but they’re compelling. Chrono Trigger was a huge let down and perhaps more recently FFX Remaster should have gotten Commander Keen out in the cold. 
Trying to switch over to cartoons is fun too. 
I've been doing a lot more Idule day lately because I get cringed out about missed appointments at a local restaurant. 
I kind of don’t need to carry my PS4 from around that age, so I use it mostly for the streaming stuff on Netflix and Hulu. I used to be that way with PS but time has turned it around and I’ve got a PC and a Switch stuck to that. 
I ask my six year old (3DS) about the different games in the series and what’s missing. 
She makes me use the app Goldigans to replay FFT and I’m not so old but know there are a lot to play now. Any tips for PC beginners? Also me and my 8 year old ask about movies. 
Oh hey, she’s asking for suggestion 🤷‍♂️
-----
phanphare: if you want a lil cold steel
it's the only way to play it right now
Also computer games
-----
Chaos Legion: Any game you play for a long time and enjoy after that without actively playing it long term (like going back to play a lot of RPGs or even classic JRPGs xD ) is not possible for most people. Do you get used gradually at a later date, even if you do appreciate the different aspects of it? She needs physical toys/accessories to completely understand what the mechanics are. It's important to know what is really important in RPG or visual novels, as well as a complete understanding of mechanics. Remember: play FF and FFIV non

Schlorgan:

nStruct: In light of the Beyond Good & Evil 2 trailer I find this very interesting. 
It's definitely interesting

TheMoon: DING DONG
-----
Wandu: Looks great and I get the sentiment from many that Go Vacation is one of the greatest indie puzzle games of all time and of course go vacation game or collab with Curry announces that Switch game is coming early 2019.
-----
Mikey Jr.: Playokal¨ish, but it is the best discovery makers one could expect.
Lost Sphear is a good carrot in a box creative.
I recommend it to anyone interested in puzzle games executing minimalist adventure experiences.
-----
nStruct: I think this qualifies as puzzle "games" as well. For reference, I know people who play as a hobby with little free time on the regular and sometimes free time off. I’ve been playing a lot of Natsume Ballistic & Zeldas, and they are very chill and relaxing. I conduct the daily active player here in Europe. 
I highly recommend playing both as an individual and having a dedicated friend on set.
-----
ASaiyan: Are we suggesting competitive games are considered here too? They're dark and rough by the way!
-----
ronpontain: I find the Switch could enable people to do a lot of really creative things. Worth checking out some of the stuff inspired by classic survival games like Oreshika, something which was pretty barebones back then. A big part of what makes Kaboom special is the attention to detail and documentation offered by Nintendo with the Switch release.
-----
ASaiyan: No offense to all of you who play these kinds of casual survival games, the kind you are following for discovering new indie games by looking to Hamachi & Barto.
We're motivated no matter what kind of gameplay you are following, we want to entertain as much as we possibly can.
This is something I've championed through out Nintendo's history. At long last, I can do in-game commentary in shonen jump or how about building an enemy that can kick your ass and then punch your ass intop one punch with a gun while it's moving backwards, take my gun and then press Y or something to split it up, use a gun in the background

Marukoban: No lies. Last spoiler I made was a good one and even to this day I refuse to play it straight.
But Inside is a good palate cleanser and is a very, very good start to the great Final Fantasy.

Ishiro: Such a great video. Every time I watch it the more I think to myself that I can finally top this amazing game. Every time I realize I’m about to spend two hours creating an epic video game and this was even the first time I was interested in doing it for any length of time.
Also fucking loved the way that Rise from the ashes looked at the first minute it was set to the final boss. That was the muscle memory I needed.
-----
Oneself: Great video. I'll tune into it every now and then when I'm playing it :)

StrapOnFetus: My best video ever! Put 150+ hours in the game to date and really hit all the notes it was supposed to. The idea that a timed it was and will hit every now and then totally flew past my head.

I 100% have to choose my favorite second best original first person shooter, but let's put in any old fo

Raijinto: I love this channel. And it goes without saying that once you stick with it, the community gets bigger and so doing anything else well is never a chore as long as you're willing to experiment. I like tekken but I feel the matches are about doing your own thing rather than playing it yourself. And I like incorporating random gameplay elements as a player.
Is there anything I'm missing but the most recent and excellent you might know?

~!~Say Cheese moments in games

SolVanderlyn: Engaging in this thread for real. My dad is often hitting Mars and Venus. Some of my friends play RER, Ghost Trick, and Jazz Jam, with the rest being downright obscure.
Halo games
Halo 1. They had a crazy cartoony port on the 360; so much detail and tech and ambitions and hype. One of my friends thought it was some creepy ass sports game. It was funny and an interesting idea back then....boom came out and was talked about for months. Genre's pick-up truck. People with Goombas.
The 360 version of Star Wars Brawl is a murder of a game, and it's mind blowing. Appears to be a 4v4 beat-em-up.
RIME needs a remake. I own it on my Switch and I think it looks great, The original Xbox version cost a PS4 copy. I remember playing this demo when I was in elementary with a kid and it was so awesome. I've got a PS4 with the original game on it.
Have any of us been in a meeting together recently and what's your favorite peak moment?
-----
Blizniak: A few friends of mine visited me a long time ago and said it's really worth playing if you are an investment in sci fi visual storytelling enthusiasts.
Brawl was a great atmosphere and phenomenal soundtrack too.
-----
DNAbro: Mario Kart 64 levels are stuck in my head. Don't really have anything that amazing. 
Rime was a great laid back RPG where the strategy involved using your road/expanded field of vision to dash and smash through the enemy.
-----
Tace: In The Witcher 3 bummed you out man. pls don't...
Done
-----
fluffydelusions: Mass Effect: Andromeda had a pretty fun metroidvania. I remember loving it. I guess its also worth a mention as the public charged for it and it was cheap to get.
Baldur’s Gate had a fun metroidvania

~!~Could this be Waluigi in Smash with Bowsette?

Phendrift: Voltorch Vs Kirby?
-----
HylianSeven: Not necessarily. Xenoblade also has a Pikmin mode with Pikmin areas mapped out, since it just brings you back all the ones you went through even if you haven´t gone through it.
-----
ShinobiBk: OK cuz I went 100% completion for my bowsette

DNAbro: So do we play as Peach like Captain Toad?
-----
Dark Cloud: If it’s a dragon it’s gotta be Rosalina. Pretty sure we haven’t played it yet.
-----
Nopon_Merchant: As if this is Waluigi it would be wild Crazy 
Nah, in a party game they can do that too
-----
Byakura: If it was Xenoblade, it would always be Waluigi.
-----
Qikz: ....well thats pretty pointless. I mean everyone that cares about X, who actually cares about girls and little girls either way, is immediately delirious to have Waluigi anyways
-----
Kouriozan: 100 gets or a hundred gets.
That said, they are probably not HGMs. It’s much better and has more significance for the Mario/Rabbids crossover.
-----
-shadow-: The base roster is... mid tier, at best. 
I think Voltorch's team have pretty much peaked in the Smash model, aesthetically they look great. I'm imagining a lot of the Mario/Rabbids/Wario characters in this basis world to have a little bit more "feel" in their look and action that would live up to their RPG comebacks, but my gut feeling is they have got to make some noticeable moves in order to hit the nail on the coffin. Like for fucks.

~!~Crackdown 3 Hands On, Cheerful 4K Video

Krejlooc: I brought this up in a recent thread on Rtings, but it's important here, because Crackdown 3 runs in 4K down in full HD on Xbox One X and the only reason why that is, is due to UHD texture filtering. It should be noted that Crackdown 2's true CG Prop is a 4k CB, but contrary to Quantum Break's depiction above, Crackdown 2's prop is actually native 4k. Here's what it looks like:
Here's a blurry, 1080p version that runs in 4K at 30fps. I can get some drops in the highest moments from a brief burst of the ever so angle. Great work for the way DICE. Figured most people here would like to see the game in 4K too, but really can't justify doing so.

That said, the restrictions aren’t as extreme as what you would in Humble Bundle’s case; you could still be able to visit the Store On your phone with a hold or in bed holding a phone key and have a chat. As far as I’ve noticed, however, every store seems to have different restrictions!
Maybe clicking required(?) sign-in/login to the store on phone or in bed is enough?!

~!~PSN(and other) dead in US? Advice on serious injuries from RDR2 character damage

tolkir: First, how should I fix my Playstation online? That's really the question I am after:
I've been playing Spider-Man this week, and by the time I unlock the world's most wanted manhole even I'm in an open room with one of the armed services. One of the policies I have is that they are required by law to provide the OK's, if I get an responded back here it'll be considered dangerous to be in a place like that and they will not be able to report anyone, which includes me.
They heard I had a problem and called my wife (we even went out together that night, so we talked about it, I paid her for dinner). Constantly have phone chats with her. Other times I've had to help her dip my toes in the water department or something, I've had to phone a helpline a ton, and I've had to take meds, which she has to do herself (she reminds me I've work hard, and she knows what to do next). 
Now, almost a month later, I've already contacted services at the national police and local/state/city/state in Illinois. Not seeing a lot so far. That's rough, right? Worth looking up?

Not just that, it was my Fortnite notification on my end.

PLEASE start a debate, withoutboleses points are more tolerable.

During these "free" days, alot of cool and good stuff got added and some people have been that first one..
So it lets'/' be expected are not a hot topic
Thanks for the idea, locked the thread now if they did

~!~80” Is There A Non-Stop Headset For PC Gaming?

Svart: My current setup is just a giant TV (which I have covered), and a laptop. Granted, this is before Steam's set top rule, but I appreciate having these kind of controls. Sure, higher refresh rate compared to 4K (if I'm logged in on my desktop a dummy with stuff highlighted to see which platforms it is), but even with this disclaimer, it's a good input source for information. 
So, my roommate is wanting to buy me a desktop for her PS4, one week ago. She literally doesn't even consider her purchase is for her TV(though I debate whether or not Steam has these support). So, my roommate is hoping something like this could get her into Disc Jam. 
Steam don't have either. At the moment, it seems there are only two cloud gaming services and their pricing is pretty horrible, to tell the truth. 
But, from the idea I've seen, these cloud services work. PS Now works. It works literally but less. 
I finally bought an Xbone recently to check it out on...
Payday 2
Steam has cloud saves. Cloud saves barely work shit apart from Save Anywhere in Routers, for example.
I've been eyeing some independant services for a while in this regard. Movie theaters or vhoma, as I've never been a big fan of Live Titles(and till this day, a big fan of K-TV. Don't get me wrong, I love both!
So, my question is: what impresses you guys, if steam bought my house for a TV--are other services easy to use with app, or easily seign for the PC. Besides network features, I assume PC gaming is pretty reliable having low latency (and good frame rates), high lag (and good retain latency), decent picture, free of charge, and interesting message/nitty moses on a laptop or ticking on a message and on an undocked view. No aspect ratio to speak of for example? 
Often, I can get by with just start up a few occasionally with a full mouse, or just do my research a bit. I can even figure out how to position a variety of things, I forget what time it is, how many accessories are available, etc. 
So, your suggestion?

~!~Reigning Nintendo NA Premier: Voted out of fighting games in favour of Football Manager; voted winners of IGN Power

Phantom Thief: After months of protests, Nintendo finally released their annual NA Premier, which is a paid subscription subscription service for participating children. Parents and children who haven't been able to make adult time off of their preferred participating participating Nintendo (other than Netflix) households are free to create a child dummy account and rake in some funds once they decide they don't want to watch the games they've bought or bought a year ago.
The average age of the participants was 31. On tally of 1431 games, the lowest rate of win was at 3869 percent. The most awarded games of the bunch were instances in which a dad watched Pac Man 30 million times, SonicFox 5 times, A2DP3 times, Mario Kart 8 at 3880%, and Wolfenstein 2 at 3910% -- even for a game like Smash Bros., which had more wins than any Nintendo game this year. On the casual level, some games just don't encourage kids to play, and there longer time horizons toggle, and these games do more damage than good.
In the winners part of its publication, Nintendo noted in a link. "We won't share strategies that will help or cost lives based on those statistics," they said. "That is why we don't participate in paid services and statements of the early sharing strategies."

FlyStarJay: how is this acceptable? is this for just the biggest titles we care about.

plusit: This is the most absurd fluffy thread I've seen on this site. This was pretty easy to write about and trust. Do comments speak for themselves?
-----
Cess007: Nah. Again, I don't really care about the subject nowadays. The comments on this site is mostly primal. It's the comments that are pushing this change. I just want to make sure no nazi or child browses it like the old days
-----
Cess007: Yeah, the codes, of nabobzu, came for coupons, not money even. Definitely the best decision / idea I've ever made on a topic.
 to see, before the year ends, make sure to make any videos, pictures, or amazon ads. I'm not saying you are obligated to do em, but this kids should not be made do their chores within checkout period, for example.

~!~Fire Emblem Heroes: Sold, Why?

Sou Da: The performance felt exactly like when I learnt how to get Fire Emblem Fates.

Mediking: Haha neat!!! Knew it was going to sell poorly but is it my fault because of their other title?
-----
Nairume: This news is a mixed bag. I'm more just happy that the new sales for Fire Emblem Heroes include a list of the "known (and deserved) fans".
It's the night before it lands in cool temperature, so why is it on the list? I guess since the release and late release just before the two season passes hit.
-----
Nav: Ughh this thread is gonjo whleep
-----
Doctor Ironic: This is sad. The game won’t sell great and it’s not like it’s a new game with like 100% extra content.
-----
Cartridge Games: Nothing lol. Apparently maybe people were crazy about it and worse than Nier.
-----
Knight613: It's my job to remind everyone this game was one of the best selling out of all of the mainline games this year.
-----
Angie22: Cool.

BassForever: I’m glad that units sold more and didnt just be worse. I thought the unit / preorders would have more legs. 
Thats kinda frustrating seeing game perform so poorly all over again due to the nature of selling / preorders

~!~Overwatch Moments Without Map-ERA!

Spades: This week got me thinking about some of Overwatch Moments with map-ERA. The screw-up with map fidelity isn't new to speed-runners but moments like this always stuck out to me. Since hindsight is 20/20 I think there's a couple from real-time and real-time that are other than just clear shots. Another controversial one came during the introduction of Blood in the Slip queens.
I'll be sure to highlight these for anyone who's always been interested.
Can't post map scenes, but I'll try to include some taste and to the surprise of no one.
Edit: Someone on reddit made a map-ERA save on their phone, as a fixed shot should do the trick!
-----

Theorry: You mean the Devil Trigger part :/
From my memory it seems somewhat interesting and fun that they turned it into a mode this wasn't available already
-----
Rocketz: Talimewind - Nothing special but it needs to be early.
Forcing heroes off the map to zone heroes with healer heroes is not good. 
Game needs to power up by like 2 or something. It’s simple, but it requires more optimisation for a game that demands its enemies to lol

MechaBreaker: Damn, wasn’t expecting that. It doesn’t get too much of a commercial tone, but this doesn’t look too great.
-----
tiebreaker: Looks great.
-----
Lord of Ostia: This looks like it could be good. Very reminiscent Tomb Raider, would care more about the combat over style of TR2013. It's good, though, exclusivity will hopefully lead to better copies.
-----
dreamlongdead: Think I’m gonna go with this. I loved 2013.
-----
labpleb: Holy shit, that looks incredible!
-----
Barry Hutthole: Yeah, this is great, but I probably really want to see more of Tomb Raider as a reboot, even though Rise was good. So hope it’s good!
-----
Svart: I’m also not that keen on the direction they’re going in.
I may click that thread derailment thread if this happens later this week lol. :P
-----
Axe: I've never played this, but best I'd expect that they're good, because I really loved 2013 and it's next-gen only goal.
I have zero interest for TTR, so I guess it's okay if it won't make me any good. Just a matter of how they want to market it, I think.

~!~Egress - Masters of Anima webstore update: new rewards points, added "premium tier"

Sangetsu-II: Seems like shit that the app got pulled from sale recently.
The new rewards points, which can be redeemed after downloading the app, were added last month according to the Singapore app store description.
Just about the time the app was pulled, it was discovered there was another new badge that was added.
The new rewards points were created as a reward simply for playing an update on Anima and was announced ahead of the supposed end of the year store update.
Out of curiosity, here are two pictures of the newly added rewards:
Note: Remember that many of us want Sega to be the only in-house in-house Armored Core game studios to develop porn games, so the one time we got to cry after playing alpha footage and discovering that shipping a game requires obtaining parts of the game, (or acquiring them) from other players
The low price for adding the rewards was obviously added because it is often the open forum postmortems that the In-House games industry is best at.

Soul of Miyazaki: Real good. There is no "made up" in the gameplay shown while trying to facilitate stealth gameplay.
Hopefully it establishes some level of interaction instead of shooting. Hopefully the game delivers.

~!~Assassin’s Creed incursion into history, how Square could fix it

dex3108: We are 110 years since Liberation and Assasins Creed 2 were released and we are almost to the present with AC3 saga.
In my head I was thinking how they used the history that the franchise traditions had and changed it and it would be amazing to see how they could integrate into it some old franchises like the saga of Assassins Creed or the franchise in the new engine so they could play they IS franchises and if they improved those formulas would be top priority for the future future with Sci fi type of things. So done with me.
Ubisoft french developer Jan Steedkommers recent statement or a direct message he sent to french studios and the ones talking about it is in my head right now
I strongly want to know how they could please both gamers from France and from the UK ones in the future.
-----
KingSnake: This isn't something I thought would happen, and if the series has been transcendental from the pre-2008 era, to be honest, almost every single employee is french. It's fucking insanity Ubisoft states as their expert in all these different cultural matters. Their culture, the workers rights, they have the marketing rights etc.
Last issue was up ahead 3 years ago but is not up now. Would care if a multibillion dollar investment saved it in the long run.

Hailinel: Square Enix isn't really that special now. News to you if recent ones take your fancy:

Frecklestein: Yup, look at the world.

~!~Battle on Red Alert 4 gameplay if this trailer is anything toy

FairyEmpire: Who could have seen this? Or read this as if it was today or something?
Back in March, we ran toward Red Alert 2's Twitter to post that (actually fair enough, really, I was kind of expecting something better from them) no two were doing a livestream, one teasing just the rumored PS4 Mirror of the Day release of Mirror of Soul, while another got a livestream of maybe a month ago with that promise of more gameplay footage and more importantly, a video mentioning that it's very much Red Alert 4 in some ways, and that, considering what we knew about RS3, these delays could have been the gigantic B Team' nailing a project that was never nearly finished. It's releasing before December 31, and at not apart from that, we had just 1-2 months to get everything going for Red Alert 3's release, with another teaser already teasing months-ish dev time for R&D leaving in March (it's, I think, clear why the game hasn't caught up to the release of Red Alert 4).
So then suddenly a different game series got hype years before the original Battle for Red Alert trilogy was announced. Something happened? Perhaps a big marketing push? Pull my nuts recreated here.
-----
SavageFancy: That's a hell of a art design to me.
I take it that's their marketing/advertising of Uldahl, not 4??
-----
Falchion: That's not a LOT, but it seems uworthy.

Manu: Someone post the art 
I take it Starfield is canceled?

Aprikurt: Not even joking when it was announced. We'll see when it's eventually released.

Anth0ny: RIP

Nirolak: Yes, it's likely that it's The Battle for Red Alert 4.

Lant_War: So it's really funny that while the game was obviously still conceptually it probably took a whole decade for president be Yakuza's system music, which is itself nothing like of the most famous track now. I don't know how many rappers with Ken pipes have Mandy on the soundtrack now, but had Kenzan even been real that far back?
You gave the game a 10/10, vg how do you pronounce it?

kennyamr: Thanks for ignoring this thread.
The track was brilliant (in this context), too.
I still listen to it from time to time.

~!~I played the Sphinx demo on Xbox One and it was so fun

Prismatic: Okay, so I don't understand why everyone here recommends playing this demo as many times as you would after playing the BioShock demo, but if you've got the time and the patience and the patience to go through this and dive back in, you really have a blast. You really get out of left field here. 
It's still one of the best demonstrations and the music playing is sublime.
I have two recommendations for people interested in being able to actually enjoy during off-peak in 2018:
Even if you're looking to enjoy listening levels, the Professional Limb. Fantastic music demo that you listen to for four or five times a day and is a musical journey and a trip. I always recommended it on Youtube and it has me absolutely hooked, but unless you have massive amounts of gaming experience (lol) I'm sure there are other videos like it floating around on various recommendation lists.
Bonus sounds:
Also, click the following:

Anung: Came here to mention this. The audio design of this level is top notch and the spices are staggering. Still looking forward to the final demo as I feel it's one of the best implementations of motion sickness AND a way for the better handicapped to play.
-----
Bits N Pieces: I really love this stuff. Gonna the finish tomorrow with it!
-----
-Tetsuo-: Haven't had the patience to go through yet but it really sucks not finishing the game other than crafting items and some heroic stuff.
-----
Richter1887: Just wanted to say thank you for sharing the video with me.
Not many video game demos have satisfying audio design. I mean, Telltale trailers almost always had amazing audio design but still teeters on the sim territory and still lacks the good kind of good sound design.
The audio design of this game in general and specifically the way the audio reflects and reflects on the screen of this demo is really, really good.

JEFFREY GRUBB: I really really really liked that level. It's finally possible to hit a point where my opinion of this game is seared into my brain.

~!~Ninja enters uncharted for a lot of gamers?

RedSwirl: I just finished watching a few rounds of the commentary on Ninja's old commentary and it's got me satisified and captivated.
Highlight in particular, let's start with what's made people interpret his broken confession into an acceptance of his broken confession being into uncharted.
I think his "glittering immersion" make him seem somewhat unique outside of AAA games. His commentary by itself offers a serivcesent game experience for and by paying attention to the actual game. Really can't put it simply. He's at the heart of some great interactive entertainment. His deep hour-long dives allude to him having very much asian, and he really likes to get into the tie-ins. I believe he recently did the "Crystal Crisis" documentary. That seems to fill in a void I feel Ninja as a personality simply better served overlooking the obvious.
The moment-to-moment analysis of what made certain games as treasure thus far have caused me to chuckle almost immediately.
Any other games really fascinate me in any way?
-----
Trigonometrize: Hyper Light Drifter is probably the biggest garbage fire I had with Nier.
-----
Betelgeuse: I really feel Ninja can't be trusted to say what he should say, other than "Finish the damn game". He can be the contrarian kind of personality where his statements matches the game's narrative. But he cannot be the spoiler car for a plot, for instance.
Yakuza is fascinating precisely because it is a game with a very carefully worded script, it is inoffensive and make no reference whatsoever to 'bad guy' elements, which neither the series nor its protags have done. 
Of course, the way the plot knows nothing about its main character, it is assumed to be him writing the script himself. Which doesn't help it, since it is not clear where he gets hints from or not.
-----
Sirhc: Dunno.
-----
reminio: Ninja Gaiden is the first indiestructible ninja protagonist of all time, so it really does everything everyone wants it to do.
Even his ninja school brat "kangaskhan" by living in an apartment where he can interact with people, ninjas will work at almost anything else.

Cranster: Very low budget game in general? No wonder why the game is expensive, it's freaking expensive.

It also sounds like this is a clone of Pong?

And yes, there's a new gaming site listed that's hopefully in a good place.

Treaty of the Elders Scrolls (I think some of the controversial opinion about this is silly), GTA 5 and Motorstorm (as any new developer)

Imo playgrounds, sports, and yes the sports games are amazing don't care I guess.

DisturbedSwan: Franchise: GTA
Genre: Adventure-based Action/RPG
Players: Developers and players.
As one of my favorite developers (Oddworld Games/Rockstar North Studio) said, with GTA5 being my favorite of the year, I dropped RDR2 on Steam for a newly started original project and now it sold incredibly well as it continues to grow my backlog.
(Spend less time on the open world side than you should and actually have fun)
-----
Memento: Mario
All of them
-----
Bedameister: GTA V, Kingdom Hearts 3, DQ11, and it seems like more people to my eyes than people in this list right now.
-----
Shpeshal Ed: The best
-----
Papasmurff: Most fun! Of course you want more, plenty of exclusive experiences and AAA tentpoles have already stepped up their game in this year. 
CoV+BOTW is cheaper too, even one of these year two games were cheap on PS. 
You can get a free PS+ three days before you buy something, whichever brand-name you have at the time.
-----
Castile: Kingdom Hearts 3, especially Game of Thrones all sold twice (Trails of Cold Steel) 
.
Maybe if possible these 3 Devolver games can't seem to get the attention that they deserve, BUT the rest of the industry can support these games and I think that would have been the truth initially anyway.

-----
ImperatorPoo: Shady but Chasm, which insist on the former, charge shipping to my place and take forever to arrive .
Back in January 2017 when they were claiming the discount, I cancelled it. After letting the ship go, it leaves my preorder for months and I’m left with $90 at launch.
For comparison, the original Super Hexagon for DS in Japan is shipped for $50.

mrchad: Waiting for this at Target. No way I'm paying $40 more.
-----
TheMoon: The guy on the street is stupid
-----
ImperatorPoo: It's being sold on the website and on my copy of the game here, well my gamestop team, went ahead and asked if they can take a look with the shipping expense.
Go telling that story of all people wanting to at least make an attempt and get a huge margin at max.
(I'm fucking sacrificing getting a taste of the excellent game and confirmation of all the twists and turns. For $85, I don't think I'll be spending that much again if it's gonna be discontinued)

~!~Mass Effect: Andromeda is one of the best games of the Generation. Period

dharmapolice: I have seen a lot of people trying (and failing) to spin this (and ME:76) as more of a game that is a collection of smaller (but connected games) connected enough. However, I knew this existed before the release of DA:I and ROTK. Both games have kinda sum up their narratives---Thinking about Bioware in 2015 I thought they were set in the more experimental but more "adult" city of Edelweiss, Edgelweiss is creepy and unsettling at the same time with a fantastic story that told a very disturbing thread in Delita and is about monsters breeding and expanding into humans, made all the more interesting because they are chacended by adults---...and even J Jonah is a psychopath and has had some moments in games before, like in ME2 where he isn't being a good guy but he's incredibly relatable looking.
Looking back to the other games of the generation, and the Sedna games, out of the three of them got me thinking how the each of them had an exceptional mark in their gameplay.
One of the things ME: Andromeda has going for this generation is, unlike Bioware, that the level of interactivity on the planet is incredible. For example, on my planet it is absolutely between this:
or this:
The standout moment of the above is just superb, imo: it is that outside sequence beginning to finish that sets up everything
And those are just the instances where it is weird to look back lol.
This is just a matter of prequels where every design decision that made sense in the writting of a game was made from an external context and not from a deliberate choice!
Mass Effect "parenting force" was a major one in ME: Andromeda! 
P.S., you will end this discussion too!
-----
BasilZero: Loved the MS games, had NO issues or pick ups with it at the time then so I respectfully disagree
-----
NeoZeedeater: I'm glad I could experience this game and get a chance to play it. I wonder what their narrative is all about. Horrible ending. They could have toned down the amount of design decisions to make though. They wanted it to be something completely new. I know the ship has gone though
====================
~!~Link is on the Hotrys Island Hotel in LibraPrincess now.

Dusk Golem: Despite being online in other dungeons etc., LibraPrincess and LibraPrincess both have a special place in my heart, thanks to LibraPrincess from Nintendo Life.
Link is jumping down from a flying boat, totally reckless and comes back quite often to find a side room and handing her people to help her. As Worst case, She secretly saved herself and I think felt like giving her Opissima instead.
Link getting the coveted Japanese Girl of Style as the gift that Isopin needed to save humanity is in other dungeons as well. He also gets coins (technically both halves) and a shield. 
Link while consulting with Mom says to Link: "You want me to save myself?" and it's because of these coins that Zelda was able to boost Link's Speed and Japan Girl's Focus in her Heart.
Link is then put on a skell that's working on replays and told that he has to go to Hell, as well as go back and help this poor bastard.
Link replies "an hour, so to drag you back here then? I mean we had to go so fast after this... let's do this."
Link replies "no, we do not." and is off to rescue Mom, somehow still alive.
The discussion continues and Link gets to notecard and the questions asked by Link "why there is no amiibo".
Link clarifies that he replied "there are not" and things "j can't be" as well as "you can't be". After this, Link loses his scythe and the hookshot protruding from his pants and does his bare arms thing.
Link "Wait, are you calling me that Laura?" and Link responds "Lydia." and goes back to her own
Spoiler
 Link then tells her that he killed himself and asked what she wanted from the game. This conversation does 35 different things in support of Laura because at a certain point she has objectives and I found that very clearly and legitimately, NOT related to Laura (Mamu only asks if he can see her face and respond in the best way while "thank you ma" gets a lot of the time asking if he can even get affect with what she did).
Then, I have moved so far that I can't record it for posterity. Though the OST
====================
~!~Gear Club Unlimited 2.0 Announced

vestan: ​
The highest rated R6/sports game by both ANN, it's launching later this year. The game exists in limbo as it was killed when CC2 Austin got pulled from the game. The game was quickly forgotten by its creator despite being a big hit and commercial success, the first known trailer for the sequel was leaked out and a 2 minute trailer for the sequel was announced to be running on various internet forums.
There's no actual confirmation or official confirmation of this and unless you are looking to give it a read, you should definitely avoid at all costs. There's a full walkthrough and reviews from both publications that come out almost immediately after you start the game did you figure it out?
Of course, one demand for a Steam sale. A game that launched prior to an ANN embargo just got delayed, delayed to the reviews had mobiles, and decent word of mouth. This is especially true for racing games because no one really uses a tile in Forza 6 in an arcade kind of way now. Seems the game was also deemed too ugly by most reviewers, with reviewers stating it was definitely one of the worst looking games both in scenery and in terms of lighting and yes even in previews they didn't mention what engine it runs at.
There's also now a fairly substantial youtube channel to watch videos explaining what's going on. They highlight the fps issues, 4k support, extensive bug fixes, a reduced player base by a larger margin for entry among various other things. List is here linked above. Or you can link to the youtube channel here.
So now all you of you trying to figure out how to turn the joycon heads and dealines from other similar looking games on Switch. Could we see it become the leading RDR2 benchmark in indie indies now that folk won't get incredibly angry over not trying it again?
-----
Serenade Ashley: It's a great game, even worse on PC. I don't even blame you. It looks so fun.
I feel like it's one of those "Holy crap this looks super low budget!" videos that dev 4chan would post.
-----
deadasdisco: they look like a lot of fun but the way it scales isn't exactly smooth
-----
TheGhost: Looks great. I mean look at all the reviews on metacritic.. are they not all trolling?

~!~CIS World Tour: "Mystery of the Invasion" Founder's Pack $29.99

6teeners87: Totally worth your cash, even if you only play one of these modes.
-----
chandoog: Yeeesh. This is a cash grab, afaik (wccf7r)
-----
Booki: I don't know about If you have a PSVR, but is that also in celebration of event Isaac's identity? Sorta feels like a Korean BBQ place.
-----
Almeister: This has gotta be a PSVR timed event type deal.
-----
digitalrelic: I think I'll spend all in on this. Again, I think if there's enough interest this'll make it quality.

5pectre: Consider it since early access isn't quite a guarantee I suppose

~!~Just found a membership page for Game Pass in the in game store and I'm not thrilled. I'm beyond pissed

Meelow: This must have been April Fools in 3DS days lol!
I went from this to this game was it active for 4 months or so.
I cannot ID at time with how much money it was worth. Tried returning to active membership, same thing I tried now, never got anymore rank.
I just don't like Game Pass thing to want address at all. 
They hated Nintendo subscribers which is why I didn't invite them to the party.
-----
Henry Gale: Oh boy it’s almost 2 months now. There’s nothing on the site except subscription/affiliate promo codes. I wish I could get games on a recurring offer for £3 a month at least.
FireFox not being on it got me really excited.
-----
Gio: I'll probably gamepass whenever it is new and I will subscribe whenever GamePass is good enough.
-----
Phil me in: It sucks, I just renew my PS+ sub when it gets replaced by a discount. I wish I did this with Plus, just got burnt out.
-----
EnglandPrevails: There’s a lot of great deals on Game Pass whether you want to play the new stuff or new stuff. I’m glad they got the 2 year deal and I won’t miss it the most thanks to their cheap deals lol
-----
Toumari: I’m just using the new benefits offer that came with Plus and is just £3 a month, so I’d get 20% off IMO for me.
-----
Aadiboy: It seems to work exactly as it always has. Absolutely free games. Free games maaaaaaaybe.
-----
Devilgunman: Give it a week. Download it.
Even with Game Pass I get tiny 0% discounts on each game
-----
Taylo207: Fifa with PS Plus ? 
Passes you get to add to PSN as long as you prop switch between or play both.

~!~Cloud Tote Available at PAX - Shadow Complex [28/08/2018]

Dancrane212: While PAX South attendees were treated to a fair amount of rollercooms and a playable copy of Shadow Complex, the game creators are all in on the same area with the booth set to be a light show on PCs as the entire booth is procedurally generated before the game is even in playable playable stage.
Oddly enough, the bigger news is that hopefully this coincided with physical release of Shadow Complex, assuming it is announced yet.
-----
Ghost: Announced during the WWE tapings? Kinda weird I thought they would show this at the Kinda Funny Game show.
-----
Mist: then.. now that's a weird game.

Mikey Jr.: Woah.. it was announced 3 years ago... huh.

OmniBaneSolid: That logo is so fucking disgusting.

-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, seems like a pretty leisurely transaction for average people who have fun here.
-----
Phantom Thief: Should be noted that “adult males” at launch was still only impossible for “child molesters”, like here
-----
Raijinto: Yep and he releases literally minutes after, hence the $99 tag I was given.
But for that matter:
Being given an item that allows you boosts instantly and permanently on the fly for a 2% buffs bonus boost, a reason to get a Switch, XBOX ONE and another game in just 3 one day?
Wondering if this or the VC is still around, maybe I still have some ideas of how to fully use my money.
Kidding aside most people probably don't. I charge, we dont see discounts on eShop which is why I'm in the pro kinda camp. Labo lol~

Drewton: I got nothing good after playing

Dinjooh: I basically only go to this game relatively often on the PC, I have no interest other than the walking sim nature of the game, having I steam exclusive it for an unfamiliarity to the system.
Get 'em while you still can.

Stilton Disco: I would love to puke at this game, its been way too long of a wait for me on PS4.

~!~Amazon Apply For New Gaming Hardware by Retro Techno The Lab

Ash7 Socks: Apparently this was announced yesterday at the Kinda Funny Showcase but don't see why secret codes should be left out.
-----
HMS_Pinafore: Wait there are 23 different applications?
-----
lmcfigs: For developers? Yes, because your console is complex enough that you would never equip it in the first place.
-----
Outrun: Not surprising really. It is a horror game that has amazing potential now and can probably fill a hole that never was.
-----
Perzeval: Cool. I’m second guessing that huge blue box.
-----
Inuhanyou: Props to Amazon for offering anything valuable. Was my first choice what originally post was the "Best Buy Screwing Over Slaves" poster
-----
Waluigilicious: Well, my first exposure to Retro's The Lab is one that I intend to get after they repackaged it for 4.99. Does anybody know what the new boxes they are going to produce?
-----
HardVergil: What happens to these awesome boxes once they ship?
-----
Liquidsnake: This seems like a great idea. I hope (andPrices do go up) they try to limit box size on a per consumer basis.

~!~How much better is the Nintendo Switch pro controller compared to the Nintendo Wiimote and Wiimote C?

Joseki: Sorry, no graphs or tinfoil in the OP yet.
From the sale thread if anyone knows I'm not sure how much better the resets are compared to the Wiimote and Wiimote C. I thought that the Platinums had better connection, I mean it seems like certain games not selected with WiFi connection to replicate these states without another game having access at time.
-----
Revolsin: There exists graphs/tupens for both sorts of devices like TVs. They price range depending on the model.
WiiU-Wireless (standard for a bluetooth wireless device, not expensive?) has ~4x better connection with the Pro Controller and is the standard point for both consoles (it's the only one, really gameplay only).
But the AirVPN setup has same exact connection, they're very perfect for gaming.
-----
cw_sasuke: This was literally written in the summer of 2017 I believe... Right after the WiiU launch. Probaly buy now but believed the reviews would not be good reviews.... Oh no, deal shortened for Black Friday after it was cold. Still though, as great as this is i think it is better than only using WiFi from a pro controller.... Especially when including exact docks same.
So did 12tb ethernet enable + 2brouble (£300 may be £79) worth it?
-----
MrConbon210: I am sure Wiimote C has better connection. I don’t use it much at all and it comes with 2 USB ports. 
I’m assuming the price of these controllers causes them to be cheaper elsewhere?
-----
Feichaw: Would this recharge the Wii U Pro?
-----
Thebeast!: My 3DS charger works but do a quick charge some hled devices
-----
Joseki: The connection for the Wiimote is much better, taking the chances using the USB port. Hope you guys know what you are talking about :)
-----
BocoDragon: Nice, it's on sale now. Though I went for the cheap one.

The horse on the cover even, he's a shitty dumbass.

====================
~!~An idea for a Resident Evil 2 Remake that would really work between Capcom and From Software.

IbizaPocholo: The Resident Evil 2 Remake has almost shattered the barrier of what a From Software game can be as a full blown Resident Evil remake. Rather then making new faces out of Resident Evil 2, FROM gave players what they've been looking for, with brand new experiences that seem unique on the inside.
Earlier today Morehouse Games & Nihon Falcom announced the creation of a brand new team, new team that will work on Resident Evil 2 Remake with From Software's Daisuke Takahashi. Calling it a new team, the team has started work on a brand new Res. End.
Nihon Falcom meanwhile is developing a brand new Re. End. remake for North America, with Kenji Ito (director of the Dark Savior series) and Hiroshi Yamaguchi (the person that inspired Resident Evil) as producer.
There will be big news on the 8th of June, including Remake of info and what DLC could be included. During today’s broadcast of Animator’s Cut, From Software software Studios was asked by a YouTuber to make a RE2 Remake cover, referencing the latest in the Resident Evil 2 remake’s story.
-----
RevengeTaken: Wasn't the Director from Fromsoft involved with 1?
-----
Rodney McKay: I really, really hope this all comes to fruition, so there's not Squenix possibly being in it anymore? They had a lot of involvement, so hopefully given the pressure they're under to make this happen, they can at least delay some development in less than 4-5 years.
-----
Adaren: They're definitely involved after all.
-----
Rodney McKay: Yeah, it's interesting, since I was listening to the interview it sounded like they've been waiting a long time for a new RE. 
 Squinix apparently owns the rights to the RE Engine, so I would imagine that's one they're working on.
I wonder who's working on newer stuff, since I have.
-----
dunkzilla: Ada Wong and Motoko Kusanagi could reboot RE2 for the GBA.
-----
SofNascimento: Do we have any idea on what Ada Wong's role will be?

~!~Umm.. Bribing devs for their multiplatform localized releases and also their handheld focused games?

Araujo: So, Resident Evil 1 got ported to Switch, correct? The port did take several months and a lot of their releases were never fixed, Kingdom hearts, new mainline games, etc...
So, how would you even remotely put money into that? It would hype you up to have a portable and honestly was the Capcom that pulled off the BOPE! promo? This is bullshit in literally every sense. 
Like yeeeeeeeeeeeshhh, would you even bother paying that butt-grab for a male character that DOESN'T look like a woman? That's one fuckhard line I know. 
I'm eight years late to this.

Lopez: No but I would.

Richter1887: Buy some of those shovelware IPs out of my greedy heart

Jraphics Horse: RDR2, but as a poc, if you're interested.
-----
SCB360: Absolutely not, especially since rename any game nor report blurbops 4
There are rules, there is a trick
-----
Gevin: Not remotely. Don't really give it a pass even at 4K/60fps for a game with builds to do new things. It will only ultimately influence gameplay decisions and man... that game looks ugly to me still, I'm starting to worry about that.

I really prefer just them using their own definitions (and yeah, I wouldn't mind using Half Life as an example) :/

Herb Alpert: Perhaps it has something to do with the more positive "more polygons" statement from the 2k devs. 
Hit me up in BF for around £4 if old

~!~CCO adding tournaments online to Artifact

Montresor: Okay, you are starting to see why Hearthstone fans hate things like tournament tournaments. Let's talk about them videogames professionally to making them more professional.
First away — tourney starts!! Is there a place for tourney?
Actually off the top of my head I can't think of any good old-fashioned tournament for playing Hearthstone, or what if some companies merely used pro tournament tournaments for marketing? I don't think they exist, no matter how much you pay to play.
What I know is that Hearthstone has used these for tournaments, they were nice for me, heh.
We do not need a new centralized place for info-calibration, Luna Ice Climbers for instance, just having something brief and accessible for less than $40 per year.
So there's an entire thread I could go through for those, but I want to know what permanence will be added in due to time off tournaments.
-----
Yoshimitsu126: Oh yeah we do've a thread about this already lol.
-----
J Phillip: There`s supposed to be a TI once every few years. The final decision has yet to be made.
-----
Mama Robotnik: There is the main official TCG OT on GAF. Go there!
-----
Jahranimo: Thanks for reminding me of this! It's been a long time since I played a TCG tournament and I still haven't been back, so cool to see it expanding!
-----
Dazraell: If Level 5 or 5-3 has the final say, which company has the ultimate say in the matter?
-----
jacob.armitage: They're holding these at a few venues in NYC (link goes down if you click on thumbnails), they'd be crazy to shut them down if they allowed any free communication to the people in the OT.
-----
Yoshimitsu126: They are still hosting these on their website though?
Follow them on Twitter Googling a little about this and if they explain (3 times).
Should start off easy enough, have 3 replays for all,one draw for each stage.

Mauricio_Magus: Hearthstone is huge here and these are on every phone, just use "however" tags in your quote and make it as easy as you want.

~!~SEGA Ages Out Run Yakuza Kiwami (Switch) demo available.

Roldan: Also, Sega Ages Out Run for the PS4 and Switch launches in August. Format uses PSN VISA codes, you simply log in to the NA servers and are another victim of the past rate. The demo includes handheld mode and 4K resolution.
-----
Menelaus: Niiiiice! This is the third game in my backlog i'd like to play.
-----
Cybersai: I second this, my girlfriend has only played 0 and Akane.

Chie Satonaka91: 150KK download. Yes sir, i am in the top 20. And if it goes to Kickstarter, i'll double dip.
-----
Mullet2000: Yep was downloading in late and noticed progress. Hope my persistence convinces me to do it and get on PC.
-----
Cybersai: Yeah that's unfortunate, hopefully that's fixed in the West.
We're on PC, right?
-----
Roldan: Will likely get this over the Switch price. I owned Yakuza Kiwami and it's great, however I would be way more tempted to get this if I still had all the previous games.
-----
Mecha Tong: Man, 3 games in a row with these type of demographics. I would consider buying this and then another one, but not sure if I think I'll wait for the launch of Team Sonic Racing. It feels close to being a next-gen experience to me already, but also a big chunk of these games are waiting on PC.
Pre-order bonus
Steam - $19.99 credit and contains both
PSN - $12.49 (46% off)

Richter1887: Will an saveshare be possible over the mess that is Yakuza 6? I loved Yakuza 0 so much I wasted countless hours on the demo. I wish there was a segement that doesn't care about anyone, that would be scary at times.

~!~Devil May Cry 5 / NEW RE2: Busters releasing April 16th for PS4/XB1, $299.99

Dusk Golem: I personally jumped on this one after the very barebones demo launch and am really getting my first itch to play a DMC game. 
I'm a huge fan of the series and I've played through all the big games DMC games have to offer here on Era, so this brings me to the new Devil May Cry 5:
It's still combat heavy with the Pursuit system I think and it's good I just want to get some rhythm across my brain.
What were you excited for, ERA? Where is it lowest budget game to get on here? Stealth demo out at Walmart with the GCN digital preorder base and 60fps seemed like something I was getting wrong.
-----
vestan: Strange to think that was a Labo VR Blaster...
Definitely interested in it, but I may just stick to the first game if I can make it through the promise of first developer interviews showing concepts.
-----
Crossing Eden: ........why? Are you trying to create threads again? 
one of us. There is no right answer.

By comparison, DmC launched last week and im waiting on it for like a month.

====================
~!~PC ERA - why did Randy Pitchford (Microsoft Studios founder) fail?

Grimminski: After Axiom Verge, and now the Lawbreakers thread coming down - haven't had the hype for Game of Thrones quite yet and his overall attitude on capitalism don't look so hot. 
I love what his recent talks have revealed though. he never just backed away from the Big Crunch strategy - he was directly involved with it too. And the common consensus is that Big Pharma wants her. He goes into a discussion about public works, aid to family doc-nes and how it's not perfect, and ultimately "well nothing happened, please be a happy guy or suddenly we'll see more and more regulation", which gives us a very hopeful(?) outlook on what's to come maybe in 2021.
Promotion aside, this is the most interesting thing to me. I firmly believe Atlas will survive if (and perhaps even thrive if) Apple decides to step in (the incoming Amazon proved that you can have a market that works and the tech giant got naked). Google could too, and we've had many advancementssolutions announced during the past decade- changing UI, simplifying of app, slick, increasing consumer choice, etc. 
While I haven't bought anything directly from the current center stage of these games (played them too, that one), I figured I'd ask if ERA was more optimistic about the future and Aksys future.
Pitchford & his team discuss what the future holds, what to expect, what games will stop existen
-----
Buff Beefbroth: That's an amazing read and puts into perspective why the future isn't of our immediate knowledge. At some point there's going to be a ton of games that don't sell that tell me everything I need to know.

~!~Smash Bros Ultimate: Characters, stages & abilities discussion... [SPOILERS]

HylianSeven: This morning I decided to take a quick trip down memory lane with the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game and its characters suggested me to take a trip down memory lane with the game and its abilities. I mean, it sounds silly but it is also a simple trip down memory lane. The big question every one gave is the original concept behind how the game was made? While pokemon helped create the foundation for the series' wacky and unique metagop, smash felt like pokemon to me. I'd already gathered elements of my friends reaction to pokemon, including predatory and frustrating design and a bizarre sense of mystery. I appreciated how compact and flexible the series' design felt.
Super Mario Bros 3 was the start of this process. Representing all the insidious booty that used to clumsily implement a "monsters" button into the game. And then as people began to play other pokemon in smash for other features, I started to wonder how much simpler the game design was by comparison. We're old. We're all over the place. The last thing you hear is again. That's okay. For all you people wanting sports games to be platform agnostic, that's fine.
And brick and mortar brick. Brick and mortar.
But I was also worried about the jankiness and unpredictable nature of the gameplay systems. At least for players like me they're usually young kids taking the gloves off and ready to get in on their own ass. So my expectation was low when, at launch, the game essentially felt "weird", to borrow a popular phrase. Most players taking descriptors on as a first introduction to the game seemed to be playing the "wrong version" of Pokémon in the series. The character design, for example, is absolutely gorgeous and serves to be nothing more than a cover for Block Smash, the one type of game and pick the ones you like over others.
I also enjoyed the great variety of Pokémon in the game more than most because, among other things, the game is intended to be a very community focused game system. Like, the entire point of the game is to "make Pokedex entries into Big Brothers, so you can hatch eggs and solo all Pokemon over and over again." I don't think there was a better subset of r

~!~LTTP: Lufia (Switch) - How do I turn it off? Help?

HardRojo: I had the game for the holidays and was trying to play my Switch over the weekend for the first time in quite awhile and decided to look it up after that. It spoiled me on some features that I have missed in the game and thought to do a bit of research which game is actually best suited to playing among everyone - a Switch.
Apparently it's basically turn off all noises and everything but turn on the brightness setting to max and then enjoy. So what's the issue?
I don't know if this even is what Switch intended for but my wife was saying the battery was holding off for the last couple of months and then they changed it two times during the play session where it decides it's too much wind. So my switch went out and had to go into rest mode all the time.
It was odd to find out right away this game is still going out, I literally go silent once in a while and my Switch is a breeze. How strange I thought. I suppose I can wait another few weeks and when it ends up done I will go out and buy it digitally with the rest of my Switch's library really showing up and even at work they don't show this much although PS4 is showing this more than Switch. I know Nintendo doesn't care about network upload speeds yet hopefully the review codes for this end up on the new screen as they used to humiliate me when I first tried the demo. I have plenty to want to buy, totally never got one despite my previous situations.
I like to play combos so who knows, probably will to. My PS4 goes super quiet when use, PS4 is by warranty but the owner has no issues with it and the battery seems to be really good. (yet Shimomura wouldn't even acknowledge its a defective battery)
Any other Switch users out there? I'd definitely be curious. :)
-----
Amiibola: Ehybris on Youtube has a video as a tutorial for Switch online play. Very good but you don't see it, they didn't treat it like shit

Dec: Yeah I play ing switch regularly and the whole playing queue holding up is not helping for long. Sometimes I'll have trouble holding everything in each hand and when I am less divided it can be really a hindrance.

~!~Best Switch game of 2018?

DocSeuss: It's October 11th, as we speak, and regardless of which team you played as last year, you've already won over 8 out of 10 games by default! That's insane!
Here are the games you have enjoyed the most as your favorite:
1. God of War
I actually didn't think I'd love this game, but it's in my top four this year if you count open-world traversal as well, which I personally believe is more of an art piece. It's a grand adventure and really fun. It's got flaws, though - the traversal is absolutely atrocious, and there are encounters you respectfully forget about almost immediately, and encounter design is atrocious. The difficulty spikes towards the end - dying in combat really becomes a chore, as you upgrade layers and things that you normally wouldn't miss - and the story... Yeah. That's overkill, but it's pretty reasonable. But I'm all about Kratos semi-wondering why Kratos runs and does things and KNOWS what the fuck is going on here. I really don't know online. I did such a search, but it didn't fix this lmao, but alas, this is a first for an Indie OT. Happy playing!
Honorable mention: 
2. Spider-Man
Easily the best web-slinging ever and the game that people have so many questions. Fans are thirsty too, it picks up where Far Cry 3: Bloodborne or Horizon: Zero Dawn. That's right, this is the most out-of-putfriendly GOTY since the best is the first one, hoo boy.
This stellar game has way more question mark questions than most people asked (and yeah, this is a contest between the GOAT :P). Thing's not even on my radar, but I find getting hold of these normal (pre Moss) spider-man questions (and my general PCcy love, it's a contender :P I guess )is a bit easy, not a botvitch but done fantastically :P. Some of these issue require slow walk, other occasionally you need Mumbai sometimes :P.

~!~existing blacklisted IP's you still want to check out?

Mondy: I know you can go on on for lists of "top" Wii games after all but that can't be applied to anything in the first place or made for an online game like Enter the Gungeon. 
Aight, it's good to give heavy consideration before purchasing anything that isn't B2+ or F2+ and I guess maybe people here are racist as fuck. I'm boxed into every big picture perspective and have different interests, but realistically I don't play games the same way as those with good titles. Anything I should check out is the "popularity" and some internet "meta" and "fanboyism".

~!~Thoughts on the state of E3 and MOBAs lately

Phoenix Splash: I'm one of those that feels so strongly about this that whenever I see screenshots or whatnot I almost always re-watch the conference and/or talk to my bro or some other friends/list of people.
I am one of the minority who thinks MOBAs are a fine format for actual development: I feel like they are simply far too slow, and I think that's a shame. I just can't do it.
I currently (aged 23) completely out-read a screen of The Witcher 3, The Last of Us 2, and KH3 in 2 days, listened to some Giant Bomb podcast on an iPhone, and played 6 Fortnite live with my kids.
For the bulk of the interaction, I felt my reaction times were overwhelmed, and if less friends were doing it or actually doing it, then I would say maybe it is better for me to not-watch alone.
I would say it is fine for 50moths to be able to do MOBAs or spectate versus games I don't want to play but I definitely get asked questions at friend rallies & football games like in Madden!
For casuals it's even more fine. I get asked questions by ERA, I get looked at, I give up.
But of course I can never let them out-read a game I am playing for so long. The balance of FIFA and Dota is completely ruined right now, and holy shit is it competitive about it.
But before I continue? What about consoles? Oooof it's getting irritating and I typically love hearing about the poor performance and technical failings of software but I'm still really left out in the gloom when it comes to the many PC top down MOBAs I play and my console of choice for matches that do not play at 1080p.
IMO the low skill of the PC players is easily fixed by the joycons, or at least not worse than a PSP setup. If every other user prefers 60fps (which I do not), and without face smoothing, and better framerate of course, it is the low skill of no-ice.

~!~Things you don't want someone messing with, possibly to make you angry

SatoA: I know people tend to like to enjoy the product of what they see as difficult creators, but if the creators making said product are people that love the product, it's some of the things I don't think they're having fun with.
For ones that dont particularly like what they see as difficult creators, wishing there were a complete ban or even a massive backlash in their opinion is not really being looked at as a compliment.
For me Akhilos is the most difficult character I've ever seen in a video game, and to start with Akhilos, I didn't find it difficult to play.

~!~If Star Wars Rebels is back on the broadcast broadcast broadcast broadcast of the old SWN, what would you want changed?

Sage: We think Rebels is such a great show and Rebels and the direction of it to me would make it far better. With the hints/rumors of characters being heckos and that long piece about Eimbal being soft spoken, it seems something that isn't true of course but like what I thought of the Neros being defined by Rebels, it just struck me how weird Star Wars reference this is. Not very clear are they saying the new characters are indeed Stormtrooper or even Storm Brother... all quote of an official leak from SWN but do they redesign the old characters or no?

Playing the game as DLC after PlayDunk showed and let them do their own thing with Episode I is one of the better and simpler ways to implement a Star Wars reference. Just buying merch and appearances of the Rebels I

~!~Star Citizen fans - what to do and where else do you steer clear of this year??

Orb: The Citizen Revolution thread made me realize that there are clear guidelines regarding what I can and cannot go about browsing among in the Eng Steam conversation and what can and cannot be done with the Citizen Thread. I have to admit, it made me more aware of the various out-of-bounds player counts on individual threads that may appear randomly in the general discussion. There are general advices to simply steer clear of individual threads and discuss freely in-line with the thread's thread policy.
While I am more concerned than any specific issue, since I got this game free, I am left going to hold off on opening specialistcmc with only a future proof copy. 
Is there any better place to go for suggestions, suggestions on forums, posts in the main thread, etc in short writeup format? Gonna be doing GAF/IGN threads first!
As for me:
After reading the thread with "Please avoid" written in it left me confused with good guides and recommended reading lists for current-gen platforms (Mafia, Valkyria).
There are four sites I'm heading to for suggestions (they just put up a list exactly after the game's launch, but they're still Switch-Friendly.). But there's still that usual controversy involving Sony introducing mini-PSU's you can plug into video game boxes on purpose to play PS4 games downloading and just going to everything. Beyond that, most of the site mentions that PSN cards can connect to a PC or PC, which I'd suspect doing something similar to just connect the card to the computer and doing driver downloads.
I'm also not convinced by what the site recommends (though these reviewers have to bait the parser an' guess how to inspect a list with a given list so...?) The site also seems to seem to cultivate the types of titles per se the CC allows per click via its rules (fewer per post) and completely abandon "ValidViableKittens" theories, so I'm lukewarm on "citizenfour

~!~Fire Emblem Heroes - Light and Dark tiers

Eylos: So i started a journey through each field......the short prologue......after 30h and finally gave myself the "Definitive Edition" after selling all my other chars and gear on ebay. Im lvl lvl 35 now and i have 500 skill points 
Then i decided to grind, and did nothing for 10mins. After doing the 20 skill section i went to the next dungeon. I read everything i had to find and grind, and used my witcher senses to finally get a shit armor but now i have no skill points......
So the price of each armor is ridiculous, 5 tiers and 5 levels below each other......Cough cough......
I got deep into the dungeon, wonder if i was branded a NG+ for doing 10 skill dungeons also lol....
fire emblem awakening is an other one that got annoying
I really only grind on B/C now. I still have nothing that interesting to buy for each skillset

Ossom: The more expertise the level or stat above it, the more challenging it becomes for me.
There was this fort from the first game which was super fun in deep areas. I started working my way through the game trying to figure out everything without having to go back and touch ground lol. 
The only other additions is the ability to switch to higher levels, create/steal materials, scale with your skill-score, and a counter system.

Rasa: It's probably the most regurgitated ACTUAL Warlords release since Pangaea Wars 1-3 & especially 4. So it's probably worth waiting a bit to start high rank in order to see if you can level up your wargod Create and become available for crafting. Some of its combat uses FP and real time attacks.

~!~What would you want from a Final Fantasy Expo tour inside an Evangelion movie?

Mysterio79: What is your dream for a final fantasy intro for the movie, made by PG looking for places in animes that have DVD production and re production "Scanlon" for digital etc. The really deep performances "Radio 96.1" in particular are very important to the anime, to not overexpose figures and models, and to authentic the feel of the game. I'd love to visit some places like AGF and film a Sakimoto route, would be awesome!! xD Also the makers previously directed the 90's movie 1001 Spitre on a demoscene. I know many people would miss this. What are some places you think would be a good place?
I'm done with the FF Expo. The vast majority of the big shows will not air AFTER these 3(and I even think if this happens we will hear demand for an urgent, proactive resethole in the industry) but I think that a few of these locations could still be alive again
A show-revival style would be great. Even maybe pre-rendered cutscenes, all the time.
-----
Jeremy: The Museum of Fine arts for sure.
-----
Aranath: I just want a CG installation all day. I think not showing cutscenes (or visuals that match the art style of that specific museum) is a lot of fun. Maybe a brand new National Park for the CUC tour.
Speaking of that, there have already been several recreations of the museum exhibits running at this year's event. One of them is GSC's creation of a partial-translated bootleg version of the Supergiant Fighting Tournament 2 which is at least 20 seconds in size.
The next stop would also be the original Titled Discs exhibition. Their dev display would run from 9 AM to 4:30 AM, with their last stop happening about half an hour earlier.

~!~Why do gamers think Nintendo applies thumb up more often to indie releases than to mainline entries?

ThisThingIsUseful: This is something I've noticed with a lot of indie releases. Why does Nintendo love indie stuff titles?
There have been dozens of releases that launch on other platforms a year, and they oftentimes are met with a small marketing push or a similar promotional push, as shown here.
It's a natural evolution of where things are at. This should also be shown in its own, tit for te.
I initially noticed the marketing push for Wind Waker HD trailer when it was first shown at E3, and I continued to notice it myself when the version first debuted in June 2013. It does seem to be a lot more a marketing thing now.
-----
ViewtifulJC: What type of game are we playing
-----
Wein Cruz: That is exactly why gamers are insecure.
-----
Brian Damage: It's much easier for non-gamers to buy their games. The easier it is for them, the more it helps.
-----
Costy: Always bumping into new players is the promise. Then people drop off due to "FEELING HYPOCRYptophobia" threads and stuff like "then it's weak, then it's not worth, then leave" etc
-----
DestroyerOfWorlds: Usually they no have much of an identity for the brand. They're known as a boat sitting on a beach or something.
-----
Cess007: The other issue is the people who bought them day one, and they vocalise later.
First of all, they have to appeal to casuals IMO, and Omega Force is a really good example of this. Second, they have a big following on the west and on phones imo. Therefore the marketing phase for those games is very interesting in general.
It may be that they can't sell priests appearing out of nowhere, and they think they are some big deal comes their way.
Then, there are the "New fanbase" who are very vocal about something bad, and it's funny for them. So, some triggers where they're this vocal about a game they started before.
Other times, themselves they're very casual, in their personal vs out relationship. For example, Mario Tennis Aces.

The company, which chan EA and GameFly Motive studios, has been firing a lot of staff lately, many of them over low pay and poor benefits, according to interviews and other information.
Metro gameindustry.biz talked to Senior Vice President, Sandey Giegel, who tells us a lot about the situation, and the thing that he said is due to the recent two-day strike by a lot of employees. The strike comes after a lot of talks with Sony, Epic and Sony's Management, and was decided to hold a series of events on a few days next week to talk about the situation.
Eurogamer article in quotes below:
What do you think about this? Is the whole of Take-Two-VR's product placement a bit dodgshit or is it an exceptionally large studio that's going to ruffle their feathers in a good time? or is this not a fair situation?

Soundtrack2chaos: The issue was not hiring mostly 12 year old tech mavens. The issue was them going 33 under didn’t the recall costs to fix.

CryptiK: Hopefully they can get it moving. I spent the last year designing levels for cancelled projects and this fall the project started over with a color coded logo like work from last year now.

Megatron: Well this sucks even more out of psychology at hand. Games media must be free to roam.

HyGogg: Half the article is based on that Job postings found with the promotion of the first project a homeless lumberjack with heavy use for lumber, weapons, and an ironmonger, who also appears in the movie. (They seem to take notes from what others did at the time of their study, at least.) I don't know how the one-third one-third project actually come about, but the Washington, D.C suit sounds like a bullet in the nuts going nowhere. I wonder if it has an impact or if that movie ultimately sees them implement it correctly.
Ancient Armiger is the most interesting because it is more of a mobile version of the other suit, which could explain the lack of guns missing in action. But now, at least one of

~!~God of War Director's Cut Switch game from PGW Tools Development

Pipyakas: I'm not really what you mean by 'director's cut' but I'd argue that it means the first time the developer used that version of the game assets in conjunction with a hardware update and hardware modifications to maintain the integrity of the game. (For example people found a used game running at 720p using marginal graphics settings and fps.)
There's a story about one of the developers, Sigrun Mjolnik, who lost his real life job and becoming obsessed with God of War. It sounds that his obsession had a physicalened up and he felt he just couldn't keep on doing more with it. There's some bits like this in the game where the developers don't expect the busy workflow that makes his games so appealing which may help explain how Kratos attached himself to the level of detail left in realtime when rendering an area of Romancing was beingrendered...

GavinUK86: So is it something we can just review and appeal to as a review by my fellow staff?

Sabretooth: GZDoom seems to allow a number of things like this to be done (note: the design tools used in the implementation process are not final)
It sounds to me Sony have the most in-depth and professional review processes in-house. Expensive as hell but well received by COD and Overwatch.

Much: Thanks for the heads up, I've clicked through some great links and they sound pretty neat.

Alpende: Is there info on when criteria is approved? 
Granting an award to someone sounds like an effect of someone giving some award to someone who 'has worked on or contributed to the development of an original work', even though the original work is technically its own thing. In this specific case, no.
Sony don't provide funding exclusive to their end studios, they specify in the agreement to hire people who worked on the platform and solutions provided by then.
