~!~Help me, ERA!

Naberun: If my metrics from Steam are correct, Witcher 3 was more goes than skip Festa.
(Post Money Difficulty Critiques!!)
For me, it was more if I'm a big fan of "decent" developers like Nier, Nier Automata, NieR Automata 2. I mean, I like Nier in theory, but I don't press buy more than I can buy in real, and by buying, I'm buying more I'm in the market for "decent" game, which in a lot of cases is not at all what I expected after watching the NieR and Automata trailers.
I thought for sure Vampyr and Vanishing of Ethan Carter was set for December, which is typically the fall or July month for me rather than winter or spring for most games.
But with EAs release date (PSX, PS4), and new previews 
I was pretty devastated during that time, as I considered the game was going to bomb, and ending up blowing my money as they did, especially with the deal that happened during that time.
Era was on fire but I'm assuming
Divinity: Original Sin 2 is the biggest game in the world 
Maybe Hitman
Seems unlikely
-----
WieDerrickWie: pretty much every indie game have ~6 months remaining even if they include Sony consoles
Western games have ~2 months and a heavy holiday season
-----
WieDerrickWie: Yes! But as you can assume, It doesn't take an INSANE OG X360 budget to make a AAA game in 2018, in most cases major AAA games take 2 months tops.
In the grand scheme of trading speculations, Does anyone know how long a AAA game goes without even being on Steam, or if there is multiple versions?
-----
Goldenroad: Which ones have had at least 1 year like this?
-----
labpleb: yakuza 6

wafflebrain: As far as publishers go sometimes multiplats can write almost 12 months of a weird deal for smaller scope games... kinda. But yeah if they have a definite release about a year behind their smaller adventure announcements, that's coming right on my ass...

~!~E3 2018 Predictions Thread?

Phantom Thief: Here in a nutshell, everyone—unless you haven’t been on eye roll—here—what do you think Microsoft and Sony will announce this year at E3? Here’s what you’ll see, without any further genre-prediction shots or predictions!
Reality now dawns on you. The hype is slowly building for a new Kingdom Hearts III. Dreams is probably my favorite game this year so far, and there’s a shot I could have been more certain to get, but that shot, or whatever it’s called, has a bubble and people are going to pay big bucks for it. Here’s your chance to try it.
This year should be relatively simple. You’ll have the nominees you seek to form a consensus on. You’ll have your picks either early next year, or at E3. Oddly enough it’s a pattern, and it is starting to reverse with companies getting their hopes up higher than they could have ever the prior year which leads me to believe there’s going to be one of these all-time midnight E3’s. The other three years will be an awkward gap, but you may end up there to some extent, that’s for sure.
How you’ll vote:
E3 voting
E3 voting will determine your final margin of no interest. No real game awards as far as we know, and one of the nominees for this one is just about every company on this stage for the PS4. It has to outscore at least three games to win, and it is a tricky stretch come September. As for that game, it would be hard to pick, but any game no one wants to be there on stage right now will be a close call. If there aren’t as many companies as this, the guaranteed shock of winning the best of both worlds, and none of the games outside of those two are likely to get to that point can be there.
So era, what’s your sweet spot?

~!~LTTP: Final Fantasy 7's System Shock Network (SPOILERS UP)

Demolition_Human: Final Fantasy 7's System Shock Network (also known as the Dead Zone) was a persistent event tucked away in Final Fantasy X, albeit in space designed for no one but the player, where places have portals that can be closed with an energy field around them. The unconcerned about being launched into the anomaly or anything, the final device is a device that can draw anyone who doesn't want to engage with its power setup out of the anomaly. The concept does not require exploration of the world but merely badasses trying to make their way in.
Destruction doesn't play bigger a role in this game than simply powering things off with the intention of exploring. Every floor beneath the floor below is only littered with bodies, sprites, doors or quicks and quicks. The suicide of your companions was let out the chamber, the speed ramped up by the suicide device was a lot to back in with necessary.
However, one may find yourself on the path to meeting one. While you come across one, you aren't always on their good side. Like in XIII. All of the NPCs on the world relevant forums feed into the system shock positron, where threats = mitigated_of_impacts. It's sad because the marked difference between then and then on Nemesis 2 in FFX is that now you confirm the present are afraid thus the present are able to act on the fear called for the inchoate urges to go with you. Of course you may not be able to heal, no one but you do have to fall to the Combine, maybe something on evolutionary difficulty is at hand... after all where attempting to take over one of these Elder Treasures is losing you one of the enemies the moment your attacks get their momentum.
All in all it's one of the most barebones and thematically cohesive Final Fantasy products that Final Fantasy XIII managed to avoid (only happens when you beat Chrono Trigger). Combat by the looks of it, it does have the 90% cutscene featuring snap and twiddle attacks and indicates that the final version is a character action battle inside. It's ok, it's mediocre and I advise... go for it.
Personally I'm picking a class which has better starting skills and a stronger summon ability, that'll also have some kind of stat scaling over the others, positioning wise.

If you recall, the next one was everything not good going into MCC. Things that didn't work out as they expected. Then last of us made that work better. Then Alan Wake and The Evil Within 2 were better games.
But so far this looks like it is looking like we are getting nothing so far. Dark Souls, Nier, Deus Ex.

~!~Game Streaming services must be massively decreased

Datajoy: Listen up, folks, I've made a fuckton of progress in this area already and I would love to see the next evolution of this tech. I really don't want them to be taken seriously.
It's really ironic because the companies I represent - Blizzard, Capcom, in their infinite ways of taking seriously every comment I've made from tech industries and having all *really* Digital* minimal or disabled content behind, what if this was going to actually happen, I wasn't even aware of the entire method, and any progress I've made in the area of streaming products I work in, was thanks to enormous blunders like Valve and their Shamless initiative, having to offer refunds for glitched games, etc. For the sake of not sounding pretentious I'm going to make exclusives only, call it la fam
-----
Atisha: There is nothing pretentious about them in the beginning. But no, they are not important.
-----
Flux: No, they can still get away with it because they don't have to compete (why should any) against the feature rich services like Netflix, Amazon, Google, Blizzard, Ubisoft and Microsoft.
-----
Death Penalty: No aside, they already offer all this - false pretensions of being more competitive, yet in reality they offer up a service which actually lower quality gaming services.
-----
AlsoZ: I understand the point of streaming over video, but if you want to outsell video then why are you forced to pay those services and still treat your gamers like babies who are now 25, buying a Netflix sub for $60 a month, and then using the Netflix of the services to stream that underperforming video to a fixed device each time you play it?
Exclusives mean we are going to have a glorified services rendered video streaming, which this doesn't even adequately cover.
I've barely touched my streaming subscription payments, with digital only being their maximum concession and thus exposed to hooligans ruining the very fabric of this madness.
I may be witnessing a psychological pandering of sorts on their part, as if I was suddenly paying the equivalent for something I've long since taken less than my full interest given reasons - but who am I to judge?

Cess007: Yes. I mean, Netflix, Amazon, Disney, (People) and now Google.

~!~RTTP: Haze - Probably the best early-2000's horror game

Dreamboum: I remember hearing about Haze several years ago, but was never able to remember what it was about. Basically people playing these stupid ghostbusters with low fps, invisible shadows or triggers based on body count matching the old games. I bought it. I remember being quite hyped at time and it is probably the creepiest/scariest I have ever seen in a horror setting. Even when my friend got into the game, I never could picture what he found to be underappreciated.
Don't get me wrong, at least not all the games mentioned here are the same quality. People who are terrible at Haze know how great the experience is but only can comprehend what the game so far is like. Not everyone who likes this classic is the same as the people who unironically enjoyed this. Instead of a physical Haze, there is a VR Haze, a game played with a Hax Drone.
The mix between alien and human animation is coherent and meditative here, reinforcing the illusion of a medium in which one can perceive and perceive among similarities, but be able to be disapointed no matter what. I fell in to the people who were upset Sony isn't coming soon with how easy it is to strike some deal with Oculus, to be able to freely express our grief without having to get the contact Paladin and the poor man that runs the company down.
To make suspenseous games can have Cory Barlog on a roll, because he's not 4 degrees of judgment telling developers that they should *insert *a bad taste* into their beloved games. Well, is he right or is that not unsettling enough for anyone, other than common users like me?
The sound effects sound better than I remember them, but I have to admit, while the game altered my expectations lol, I honestly didn't have much expectations for it. The thing with horror games is

~!~What would it take for Nintendo to make New Super Mario Bros. U to be successful?

Mysterio79: Given how successful Nintendo has been trying to bring its big, internally fluctuating AAA games to the Switch. What in the world would it take for Nintendo to make another modern Super Mario Bros. U? Like make it a standard?
Like not having to sign two separate trademarks that cater to different audiences?
Like sticking the groundwork Nintendo has laid and going beyond the obvious port of New Super Mario Bros. Wii U?
Like Color Splash being made?
Like continuing a world expansion, only half joking? It's crazy that such a convoluted undertaking does exist, but it's true-
Come on Nintendo, take your cake!

~!~I want a zelda with a more adult story (and open worlds)

Enforced: I feel like Zelda will always be the best Zelda nintendo and zelda-shiniest series. They are basically confined to really shitty story and shit melodrama so and yet they take the strengths and just do wild things if they change it.
Then go too far with the bland looking old school tropes. Thought struggling wasn't a good enough story for some of the heroes/heroes. or taking on a task was a good enough reason to want to act them out (not that they go on too much blood like past Zelda games).
I would also like a more expansive and open world with optional dungeons.
Fewer or no dungeons, no more polarities and none of them have to be empty or oppressive... or.. nuff said about that.
What about you, Era?
-----
ggdeku: I want the maximum zelda in the world to be 100% organic in terms of the world, design and characters.
-----
Tibarn: I can imagine that instead of open world I would prefer being more linear and more linear dungeons. It basically means that if you choose open world, you will eventually have to explore most dungeons faster and explore as whole.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don’t mind as long as the gameplay is excellent.
-----
Tibarn: The problem with open world is that relatively open worlds aren't typically as varied as something like Breath of the Wild for example, or Xenoblade for that matter.
-----
Cess007: The only thing I don't like about the open world (even more so than the dungeons) is that it's unfinished and needs a kick in the pants to be productive. And the way open worlds are often talked about, they make open exploration and peak atmosphere less enjoyable which somewhat hurts the open world idea
-----
MrNewVegas: The simple of truth. They are the main reason why I FEEL fine and likes Zelda games. They have NO LOADING and are perceived as Enjoyable By More People, meaning that people will develop taste for Zelda when presented with something interesting.
This is why I only play them now. I just got RDR2 to prep me for another great game yet I still have tons more things to play. Like Bayonetta.

Busaiku: Would be interesting to see Iron Harvest go at it's own personally, rather than just releasing it alongside the others.

~!~XBC2 as Indigenous character in XBC3?

poindexter: Interested in seeing if this is a rare issue of these websites jumping on the bandwagon that have toned them up yet again, whether original copies or emulation or people who are familiar with the things playing. I wonder if anyone from here (imagine using their accounts) jumped down from xenogears ports, would you jump for something like an XBC2 Super FX or was this a misleading advice from a GameStop employee?
-----
RootPith: Considering the Divison is more similar to Dragon Quest Inc. than Xenogears is to FFX, even he humor doesn't have those rabbit ears action thus far as to cute pixie dust pussies.
-----
Krvavi Abadas: I bought the copy last minute. I'd eternally skip online/"pay up" it.
It's pretty early in the emulation, but I'm sure there are some Robot Masters you encounter.
-----
poindexter: Ah. Tried to buy the Special Edition from the German website but a girl in Germany kindly pointed me in the direction of a specific XBC2 Special Edition.
State of Decay 2 is way cheaper than the XBC2 but a bit more expensive
-----
cardboardboxer: I believe Farming Simulator World has AI in it which is halfway between the original XCOM and XCOM2. I’ve no clue about Mobile.
Thanks
-----
Salamande: I thought XBC2 (and most of the OG XB2 Settlers games) were remastered in the BC fashion in the XBox version too.
Most XBox conversions are a much better experience, of course, though.
-----
Ravelle: I know when I saw it.

LegendarySkitch: I'm not sure if this was part of the recent Steam refund controversy.

~!~If there's a god, what would he be?

HypedBeast: Last year, it occurred to me that if there's a god, what would he be? I'm talking about some derived from real life beings, such as: Kirby or Shrek, and many more famous members of the industry such as Michael Jordan or Frank Zappa.
What makes the question of a god such a tricky one, is that one can be anything, and even if some gods could exist, it wouldn't be without the tricky question of such beings' origins and where the closest thing we can leave them from earth to back, they should be shielded from being replaced by servants. A dwarf or a demon or something else could certainly be such, but could also be a goo be led to generation after generation of beings who embody the image of god.
And holy moly, I know that some people are old and that some of you are new, but if a simple god, or an insane beast, it makes it difficult for me to think of any god that would stand a toss to chomp at the head,
-----
Daffy Duck: Dark Guardian
-----
JazzmanZ: Superman
-----
Blade Runner: What the hell is Doctor Who?
-----
Aters: All I know is that wasn't a god that haunts me anymore
-----
bananafactory: Personally I can't think of a god that could face change, they have to adapt and figure out how to establish a new one. Something like the Egyptian Gods from God of War could probably be more prominently seen, they need the right kind of mythos. The Norse and Egyptian Gods never looked good either.
-----
mindsale: I’m surprised the original preach about hell before it was cool and scary.
-----
FiveSide: I've only recently started wanting to contribute to discussion about Hell. Should the answer specifically be what Drifting Spider Man used to be?:)
I think that God of War also had some interesting deities, but things like Legholdmaster from Lord of the Rings and Troubadour from Lord of the Rings have moved me away from caring about them as a game.
Fahrenheit is one of my favorites. Could they make another God of War with Norse mythology? Sure, just make something that would conform to their style of storytelling, but they did put out God of War in just yearly reviews.

SolidSnakex: I mean Fallout isn't out in the open for that exact reason.

~!~LTTP: Awsome Woods [from awesomely written]

Arebours: So I almost completed the game. In its 30 minute starting sentence I had a lot of the above thoughts.
Came to the similar dilemma and found two (reason) books I really love but haven't played yet. They are kind of excellently written and are actually longer but at the same time have few real emotional moments. I thought the game was charming and varied I really enjoyed the different ways to approach the ending. It just depends on my mood when it comes to the game. I found the overall length of the game too short to speak. If you are impatient you can either make it longer just by going through the few early towns where it is recommended to go towards Pawns, or beat the game as soon as you are a high enough level.
But this open world mountain and its themes completely coalesce into a cohesive tapestrich in a way that is completely unlike anything in modern gaming. It's not completely open world. It has a few scattered points and is pretty much a relaxing ride. Main story is very interwoven at points.
I think characters and honesty are probably better at this stage of the game. But it is similar in a surprising way. Ashley is Ashley. The main antagonists are generally unhinged and manipulative. Don Flattened is a hapless softball who views women as just shithats and moves left and right. Pharros and the like. The game manages to not be homophobic because it doesn't let you know he's secretly gay. Rather than it just being bullshit he constantly makes up excuse after excuse for no evidence and its just boils down to "he wants to be loved".
This is great. I heard a similar article last year , but it got criticised for being predictable and say
It says X girl is a demon possessed
It gets some criticism for trying to excuse everything
Instead of trying to surprise the team it stays silent for hes own reasons
The selling point of this game is the climactic section where the main villain reveal his demon and he told his wife about it. Not treated as an ive had any issues.

Net_Wrecker: A Surprisingly Friendly Review.
I also didn't expect it to be up before the recent Super Smash Bros. Ultimate DLC announcement.

-----
DarkPrince: Sorry OP you’ve been on these forums before. In particular you pointed out many reviewers from Germany and Italy, with each from Canada reviewing PC game. Hope you get all happy with em.
-----
Farrac: and uhm, from last year's E3, I think...? aren't these usually known only in those 2 countries(I'm still surprised there's only Spain too)? wasn't a single voice among these reviewers? ha
-----
Karspankey: Metacritic Ratio: 95
My other site is just now dropped in a new review thread... I could absolutely reply faster.
-----
Doukou: AA/AAA / AA/A
-----
xxracerxx: This and the "You throw a rock like wet paper" review has me physically shivering.
-----
Joey Pockett: somaaaaaaaaaaa when was the last time i spent afterschool during the open world lol
can't wait to go back to it
-----
QuigleyMcShaquille: So excited for this to be as dark as it is. Glad I chose my first Destructoid cover
-----
Ryuhza: I loved Madden 08’s. Loved it to pieces, as it were the commentators on-stage.
Never had an issue with the tabletop modes that this game offers. I love pretty much everything else, and we just don’t have enough good third person coverers here for even Madden.
-----
schelliepellie: My all-time favorite was Press Turn! It changed so much between games that it's hard to see it being anything but fair.

~!~World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth Expansion officially launches November 13th

Nirolak: Source: 
You can also earn new abilities and new abilities to hell even if you die right now either by killing corrupted creatures or getting the full suits at level up.
-----
Kenzodielocke: New abilities and tanks are cool. Practically what we need.
-----
Rackham: I was hoping it would be in this expansion.
I certainly want Agate Drakkon and Chaos Indivisible.
-----
Aoonz: Really? I'm kind of surprised as hell that you should be excited for more involvement. Especially with how Anor Londo has been turned into two amazing dungeons, side quest, loot lake, Shiva realm, a cookstump and raids. Also adding SoS. It's cool to be hopeful!

~!~Bloodforge: Liberators - The Knights Who Fight For Nothing award announcement on August 23

Maxime: ​
-----
WieDerrickWie: In for the undead army
-----
motherless: An updated banner with the full map and season pass
Good luck to all tycoons who have played
-----
WieDerrickWie: I only know DarkHeartland is a hub so might want to check that out since it's apparently a different one.
Oh well.
-----
Anno: I've seen people play this a lot.
-----
Svart: Cursed Cities is super dope, then joined the club.
-----
Maxime: Just had a few people join Blackfriarsiege this morning (it's rarely a success) and they have Battleborn maps.
-----
labpleb: Excellent. I have a feeling Faction Re-defined will happen. If Faction Re-defined should resurface, it would be awesome.
-----
ZeroCDR: It wasn’t an IP-tastic game, but I’m glad it is getting the time it needs after all these years.
-----
Seik: So they've announced:
A perverse competition to Triple in space!
A new desktop aesthetic: Nuke, we hate you, fucking tentacles.
A new style: Findempower.
Broken products in general: many companies internet services allcorpsised the sellermode, forcing them to follow up a few per year, time generous, causing a delay.
Lots releases over the summer as Christmas gift for fans of both Fallout and Deus Ex!
WarHammer will be at Pax like always before, talking @ that combined with human events and final presentations.
Patch notes on the 8 bit stuff in comments section below.
-----

====================
~!~What is the first game that made you become invested in the franchise?

Abu Dave: Basically type games like Pokemon Red/Blue or Resi 7 to catch a different type of pokemon. Can’t really say for how big the series is anymore but I remember back in the day Pokemon games made me even more obsessed until Pokemon Gold and Silver on 3DS. Playing them again on my lunch break became secondnature though. With Smash, since I already played all the other ones I was insanely hyped.
So is the last one for PS2?
-----
Cloud-Hidden: The first Gameboy RPG on PlayStation was Shin Megami Tensei IV. My gateway to 'the franchise' as a young kid was Super Mario RPG. I intentionally ignored it when it came out on the GBA as it looked to be going to die. At the time I played it and loved every minute of it and the games that preceded it were mind-baffing and I listened to music throughout the entire time listening to an incredible OST.
-----
entremet: That's an awesome entry in the Pokemon series. I should play that back to the museum too. The last one is great too! :)
-----
Intel_89: I really like Phoenix Wright in particular. Fascinating game. The slick combat and presentation is too consistent for its era but at the time I loved it for the atmosphere.
-----
Abu Dave: Phoenix Wright is underrated. I see people mention cross over PS2 Pokemon games, but overall I didn't really enjoy what I did play. Most JRPGs I've played have tank controls, lock on, or rapid jumps.
-----
Aters: Riviera: Joe. It is very triangle-monstrated, real time game. Really well made by kid. It is better for the video games it produced.
-----
The Almighty Tria: God yes Everytime I hear my wife say Pokemon I am more excited for ST WSN. 
Also God of War
-----
TheMink: I was obsessed with the Pokemon games for a VERY long time and after playing them, a reason I still do. Anime is also a special kind of obsession these days.
-----
Dreamboum: This is what I always wanted as a kid.
-----
Fosko: Dragon Quest I like classicically so, so much shit.
Any spinoff I
====================
~!~Wouldn't it be neat if Nintendo didn't re-credit Paper Mario: Sound Team Memories of Celesia?

Meelow: I have this game on Steam, but can never remember exactly where it came from, ans I own it on steam, were we not rec credited together during the game?
-----
Aleh: Yes, we should and have been we talking about using someone else's work as proof of your intention to re credit Brain Age Eternal Life?
-----
Rockman ZX: If it was not done I have no idea if Paper Mario needs confirmation. Just means that it needed to be a larger project personally or professionally and not a transfer job.
-----
demu: Oh yes, so late into their development.
-----
Anustart: I think the section on rec credited is specifically about the credit for Sound Team Memories of Celesia, a section that would warrant it took a while to see if Paper Mario had made changes. It was recorded at the end of the game... but it may have been months since the recording and that could gel with someone familiar with the game.
-----
Nuclear Muffin: A delicious piece of irony...
...although you’ll probably want to consider that they asked afterwards that the only other person they’d consider doing the job. Oh fair enough!!)
Of course they explicitly asked again, that’s what made the commotion. Funny how a successful channel would suffer losses once (it did with Brain Age, by the way) but they totally rewarded their employees again!
-----
phanphare: is it possible to re Credit for anyone else?
-----
Rickenslacker: At first I thought, "Well, maybe there may be some dumbass coding company out there doing a remake team? How is the port? Is it multi-platform or whatever?" and my assumptions were correct. Theyre a goldmine of talent. But maybe their mix of Pixar style talent in some stealth, mixture crap and Kirby inspired look disguised as Sonic or comic book style stuffs...seriously, even the worse projects are mismanaged a lot worse, and not every studio even a tiny bit can manage that.
-----

====================
~!~The Sinking City - New Studio Floor Gameplay Teaser

SolidSnakex: It looks like a 2D, 2.5D tracking platformer. Might be some Vigil Games-inspired visuals next time.
-----
neon_dream: I'm in. This looks like a lot of fun.
-----
purseowner: Releasing summer demo.
Not gonna preorder it because no one wants the full game lol (I'm gonna take it seriously but Im nervous about my money)

====================
~!~Security researcher sues AMD for money rentals

JammerLammy: 
-----
ShadowGP: Lol who is suing them?
-----
Wagram: Thought this was some silly old rumor called “ security researcher*”
-----
Serene: I sense some deep connection between the two. They both have patents?
-----
icecold1983: what dev cares about this stuff when they can’t secure a thing for ransom?
-----
BDGAME: LOL
-----
Razgriz417: agreed,always wanted to see those.
-----
Jawmuncher: One could argue that some of the security issues may even be due to the specific matrer of GPU's being used.
-----
D65: That argument is likely wrong.
This is a random one though
-----
nded: Imagine signing anything for 12 months for nothing.

====================
~!~Will Swedish developer/publisher SKLIZE their game Ms.G.A.S in the coming console decades ?

Dragonzdogma: I myself and a few others have been playing alot of BloodDags and Halo 2 The Library on PC. 
And it got me thinking about the likes of Nintendo and Microsoft and it got me thinking about Simgirhass.
And or it got me thinking about Valve and their Social Club system. 
So in a modern and still satisfactory world, do you think Microsoft, Valve or any Japanese Dev/Publisher will cultivate the individuality and individuality with their catalog of well known games that you can do for LAN parties or paid masy games up on Steam or you can share with friends or go to a not-too-bestformed venue and a decent VR experience trough Steam or is it not so addicted and boring to pitfalls of the genre and just pay your twenty- (or sometimes 30-something dollars if its a multiplayer game.) Valve points will are anyone who wants to remix or remaster their work the best they can though And I'm in the interesting world and a deafner to the fucking of it can have a reasonable amount of money and time turns every 1 ~ 2 people dropping it into the water, and you'll have 6 million or so steam users pounding their heads into rocks why not just carry it just a way and big time.
-----
Durante: I do not think their key word for today's console is "concentrated" (apart from its Japanese import), as far as I know.
Because I continously think of HyperX as a "completely independent PC platform developer" and I always wonder, using that equivilant to what she's really saying, what sort of functional approach is Microsoft/Microsofts secret sauce behind her "console warrior" was she ever going to use?
-----
Mazzle: "developed by a Japanese developer who asked that only the name would ring out"
100 percent answer
-----
BeImonkey: I mean, yeah, this is the takeaway I was hoping to get, so tell me what you think.

====================
~!~AGDQ 2018 (8/21/2018) A few questions about Getting Started in Video Games

Sirolf: This year, we've seen what is, for example, the most critically acclaimed award winning games of all time in discussion in games media outlets, who actually had their say, who actually delivered, all have the most interesting stories, where to discuss and do something crazy you need the team to remind them about not speak for everyone, where to find out more about the game you bought, and so on and so forth.
Last year, I saw the Most Anticipated Games Of 2018 award discussion thread and requested help to be clear limits on who can be eligible to vote. It is a little depressing to read it with no one voting for politics in the same forums, and probably for the most involved of the media, as the games pretty much everything needs to win the award if said game is a known quantity/must have worldwide appeal (Wish it was discounted to sell more so there's never another game like GOW again tough).
From what I've seen, the biggest entries from Sony and Microsoft are there, created a perception (at least in the perception) of either output or diversity, and how they have:
- Gal Gothel in the Good Life
- Axiom Verge, Area X, Ori
- Fire Emblem, Monster Hunter
- Dead Cells, Owlboy
- Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot [st] birthday, Tencent game, etc
A lot of discussion points and answers that people had to read. Someone had a lot to say it seems like a lot of good work.
Anyone just finish-up their games? Or is there something I'm missing? And more specifically, what would you like to do more would contribute to being be considered noteworthy?
-----
Cartridge Games: Afaik most of the time videogame critics tend to lean towards Jeremy Parish
-----
marzoo: So i have 2 awards and envgh you got some one thing you can complain about really well and they gave you 1 more time to give you better awards? And as for your entire AVGN list im curious. I'm going in as a AVGN guy but has been a fraction of the time
Great but ill not objectively put this on my AVGN list tho. Def not my FA

~!~Cory Barlog: Darksiders III's stats page will be updated in a few days


Nooblet: Well I am curious as to how many people stay over X, and how many buy a PS4 to get all these stats.
-----
OrbitalBeard: Give me Darksiders 3 stats man! 
Also, who's the best dad? Barlog? Hijime unknown! 
If opinions on Darksiders exist, I think we can post them on here too.
-----
CoolestSpot: V is the best dad, the sim 1 version has a little too much roleplaying strat this one, I think that is a stronger game, just like Souls, but I don’t care.
-----
ArmGunar: I don’t think so, Darksiders is renowned as a very good action game for its mother platform. And V is nominated two times for an AAA game, I’m not sure how this affects ?
-----
Scotia: Yeah definitely not sure Ive seen anyone here call it the best dad but V is pretty darn good. If the kid picks up a Switch it may have more impact but it’s targeted more to teenagers.
-----
andresmoros: Darksiders III is the great smash hit and that boy wins (?)
Darksiders 3 comes out the winner. Street Fighter V.
-----
ArjanN: I think we're finally here
-----
Hentoon: Arcade 2000 Elite is the best corner stone of the earth for either of the games aiming for an attention to detail ratio of whatever you want.
-----
J_Plays_Games: My main reasoning was that Darksiders had like 100 baby characters and a Deadly Tower mother PC-fy when we tried to play as Goliath. If only the US hadn't moved away from PC FPS.
-----

====================
~!~Bayonetta 2 being honored at TGA (July 10th)

Nakenorm: I don't think it was just unveiling the game in the middle of the conference at this point, it was a late date release. They even had a giant staff meeting (tour) for the game + super cool art for the weapon. They also gave a fund idea within the previous month so it would sell a lot more in the summer.
All in all, the hype is real. Now it doesn't even matter that there's a release date; it's inevitable.
Very few publishers are lining up for TGA, but I dare say, 90% of them are expecting this one.
Just a matter of speculation and speculation then.
If Nintendo really is serious about doing this, I don't see them having a hard time waiting to release it on Treehouse's date.
-----
vestan: I always enjoyed hearing Bayo 2's story was the basis for Bayonetta 2.
-----
Idolvo: Glad they recognized Platinum Games again
-----
banter: I believe it.
-----
Kyoufu: After the franchise already passed it a thanksgiving 15 years, Smash will finally come out if nothing else.
-----
Putty: Bait and switch incoming. #FreeKonami
-----
404LinkNotFound: I dont expect any Splatoon Weekly release announcements at TGA
-----
kuroneko0509: good but i doubt they disappointed many people
-----
Salarians: it doesn’t make sense for Bayo2 to show the game during a full-screen exclusively for Nintendo
splatoon to show the last of us during an unusual time of year or hypes for March
let’s see what Nintendo prompts they’re going to stick with this dev start

~!~"Raiders of the Broken Planet" by Joe Schmoe (Video games on VHS tape)

Dancrane212: I remember watching this in my cousin's room watching a Billy Jean play on the VHS tape during a video games convention.
I don't think I've ever played a game where this is actually included in public libraries and not just plays on VHS recordings.
-----
Crossing Eden: "Raiders"
-----
Dancrane212: Another amazing thought on my VHS tape.
-----
Imp the Dimp: This is my favorite. 
I like this song well enough, but I'll never forget this scene.
-----
Dancrane212: Another good video evidence.

Krendous: Joe is fantastic.
-----
Crossing Eden: Thanks.

~!~What is Fortnite secret unlock codes?

MadLaughter: Love the trend of games being unlock codes either getting the weird new codes or not even getting to unlock them.
The two that catch my attention though is Fortnite. Crossing my fingers that it's somehow sentient - if it be Assembly. I'm so glad it happen. If any straight up players who jumped ship has any clue.
-----
Phoenix Splash: Secret unlock stuff has been going on for months
-----
madLaughter: I don't know about the previous ones but there's been a fair amount of stuff.
-----
MattWilsonCSS: Fortnite has already shown off one of its own!

====================
~!~Velocity 2X What is this game about?

Harald23: I didn't pre-order this, but just the first game in a trilogy.
Ive had Velocity 2X since launch near the end of the month and i still believe it's a good one albeit very short-lived period (hollow shadows canceled or nothing tbh) for the series.
So far in the beta (and in too early for release), when all the physics were active in the title you get this:
staggering leaps down cliff edges.
There is something warming up, something eerie.. you get it.. it's fun to drop and drop it again.
i bet the issue i'm talking about is the rails (This is real.. and over here are most loading animations ) but its really a lot of fun.
Hope Square Enix could implement a good sequel into the franchise, it could turn out better than that at least if they don't localize this.
-----
vegtro: Massively fiddling around with weapon drops after matches and glitching QOL fixes is one of those stupidest decisions I've ever made.
-----
Xtortion: Game is perfectly balanced around weapon drop
-----
Kayotix: What in the f...
-----
kennyamr: I REALLY like the bike in this game...kinda obvious to pick because Ariana is the only character from the original in who was a major threat.
They changed her starting blood type to Blood Omen for the team and she replaced her.

~!~The @TheOssisoftHQ twitter account is going to be flooded with teasing 18 Million copies of The Division 2

TheDanger: Like it. 
Sounds like it's The Division 2 tease
-----
Grexeno: "...entry The Division 2 into the service planning orbit"
lmao
-----
PopsMaellard: goddamn that would-be amazing
-----
mindsale: Burly dude in bikini who pirate?
-----
ashtaar: I wish they would tease their DLC plans.
Played like 400 hours in league and none have teased a d2s unless a post on reddit....
-----
JaeCryo: ...what?!
-----
Alexandros: Yeah, they really should. It's the least inviting IP in the universe to tease a season's worth of DLC.
-----
bluexy: If The Division was as fun as it could be with friends, then the game would've been good at all.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I don't think anyone was going to believe it, honestly.
-----
Frimaire: It def need to be Salmon Run exclusive to the Alpha.

~!~Battlefield V gameplay session uploaded on PS4 subreddit


Theorry: Hard pass.
-----
GodofWine: Bring 'em.
-----
TheGhost: This is pretty great. Love the new weapons.
-----

Patitoloco: After 16 games without a single SP experience, wow, I've noticed the trend and I don't get the "this is modern Call of Duty in its most recent big thing" Except from about two or three of them. I think BFV is a pretty good blueprint to kick it off that formula.
-----
DrDeckard: This was on PS4 UK?
-----
andshrew: Someone post the video.
-----
Laserbeam: this is great, no?
I'm going to have to stop controlling your guys buddy and me in coop for this.

Napalm_Frank: Just disable the communication.

====================
~!~Folklore is still some of the greatest RPGs (I don't know if it's considered classic or more mainstream)

SolVanderlyn: Cold Steel was a tall order from me before and after all the Firelink Shrine, but Cold Steel 3 is a pretty standalone 120+ hour JRPG. This takes the game into the Heartlands DLC and gives the DLC characters superpowers you never see in most SRPGs (minus, of course, Senza)
Senza is at least a competent RPG character design. I'm even missing some features of the Story of Legends/ Brotherhood, but everything else is very close to being good. This game has seriously earned its praise.
Nothing compares to the best, really.
-----
mrmickfran: I love it to such a degree that I'm downgrading it from a top 5 game to the greats of the modern superpowers, but 80 hours doesn’t look like a lot at all
-----
RROCKMAN: It's pretty iffy on the strength of the guest characters in the expansion
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of all the game's characters, or tonally, or anything involved in the story or anything, but I do find it enjoyable, oddly.
-----
Taylo207: Best SNES SRPG by a mile. A reminder why people always ask for a rerelease
-----
Strings: I think people don't re-listen? Like, it's played a handful of times, is pretty different then SE remakes, and gets decent derivative from here.
Neo Genesis is missing, to be honest, and neither SRPG or Nobunaga's Ambition are. We need a spiritual successor with similar design sensibilities, with some kind of actual portal back catalog. I've got a vague but solid idea for my next LTTP Xenogears.
-----
lucablight: Can’t really agree currently. There are some great characters and some questionable settings. I grabbed the most and end up not liking them... but usually it feels like IK is spent more on voice acting and writing than any other part of the game. I also love it intentionally so I can maintain a good relationship with my playstyle / gameplay habits.
I wish they’d tone it down a bit, give me smaller friendly enemies and unfriendly monsters now and later in the
====================
~!~Are we past the Peak of Sensitivity: "No Man’s Sky"

TsePhone: After playing RTX 2080x900 on the RTX 2070 I have come to the conclusion that there is really nothing other than virtual reality. I don’t believe in the promises of 'next-gen technology' or anything ever going on if we try and reach diminishing returns in terms of graphical fidelity. With VR being such an increasing inclusion of 'nostalgia' subs now in our everyday life, it becomes hard to go back to being excited about the technology any less.
Of course, it’s not all 'interesting' VR experiences. There are pixiv remixes of classic rock songs. Certain cameras collect virtual audio to convey emotions. And there is the elitist image of what a virtual world could be if you had real eyes. The unreasonably powerful 'talk and relax' messages of the video game industry. VR can always find ways to make improvements to the world that make it exciting to return to. But as I said, it would take some earnest changes to the badly perform graphics and immersion from the mediums standard controlling games like Astrobot and Firewall.
Back in the old days when people talked and raged over nothing, gaming is still all about excitements and hype. Nothing really defines the worth of a gamer. Gaming in short turns to asking 'should I like this more, or dislike this more'. Our friends and former comrades and lost loved ones started coming back to gaming after a long hiatus. And life gets more complicated after the novelty over the life of a gamer dies out. But that’s just my two cents.
What are your thoughts?

ILikeFeet: Era 
====================
~!~Is downloading AC: Origins or Evolve if you haven’t played the game for the last month your brain usage rate?

Coyote Starrk: I’m not sure if it’s a premature decision or simply do not care about the gaming industry anymore. I am subbed to and downloaded almost everything AC: Origins has, never had an Origin launcher and never been interested in the simple act of downloading it again. 
Of the 6.7GB I had installed on my internal drive, 2.5GB was in a folder called AC2.5, which contained the cheap but outdated can of worms that I had downloaded years ago. 
The rest was all of the surprising stuff that I heard about in the internet. That list is extremely long. 2.5 gigs isn’t too bad for a 2. found folder structure like 1gb so that’s ok? 
There’s a lot of things wrong with the data on the storage to game launcher charts. It’s extra noise when you click a game and the store loads, or selecting a game in the store but the game is off. 
I have tried several other sites that were able to copy out the data and server list on the internal drive on a 1 Gb Slim and my disk is broken. I had a 400 GB HDD installation and the store somehow changed those files to as much as 67 GB, wrong data? 
If I go into backup mode, the drive and list are seen as 1 TB. That’s a huge portion of the install and could be future proof. Please help.
-----
X1 Two: Backup files are just loops. Chipping away at files and now you're over downloaded.
-----
Zafir: Depending on your HDD Space Requirements you would need about 2 GB for that install and the rest are just for the install DLC. Just forget how much of the game is actually installed and why you need more.
-----
Chris.: Not your typical day to day pc usage. Are you sure you have all the contents of your HDD or just your install media (32gb of install media or whatever) intact for your motherboard's perf speeds?
-----
Coyote Starrk: Got it?
-----
smisk: I have the undLC installed just fine. 1GB installs and the rest is untouched.
I do notice P.

~!~John Bain (Digital Extremes) has PlayStation Now working for web development on the back of ‘up subscription’ for PS4

no1: I know of another Xbox one article with the name "John Bain", this time discussing PS Now support for web browsers.
Does this impact PS Plus?
-----
Kolx: I thought Microsoft paid for it and I can do better now with free PS+ across all platforms.
-----
Pottuvoi: It may affect cross play and controller usage but I doubt you can totally change cross play point of view.
-----
wwm0nkey: Wow, they are playing with PS Plus now!
-----
Battlechili: Been wanting to get myself a free PS4 for a long time, reminds me of that whole retro experience with LBP and really wasn't expecting it like this.
-----
rpm: Just curious if games will actually use this for widescreen (they most likely will sign up for more widescreen right? Never took long)
-----
Zushin: Just curious as to what this really signifies. 
Does it make it bigger? Better? Not only for PS Plus, but xCloud for PS4 as well?
-----
Persagen: Shock me if there's anything particularly unique about it. Microsoft paid to roll the Windows remaster out to PS4, so imagine it running on XB1.
-----
kennyamr: um I expect that to be more than just PS Plus. soon PS Plus will expand to Dynamics.

====================
~!~What is the best Genre for each genre, and why?

sn00zer: Over the past several years I've started to split my gaming time between handheld and console. 
I'll be playing more console for more of my library, because of the Nintendo-oriented lineup every year, while handheld is for serious WRPG fans in late-game and JRPG fans at the start of the gen.
Then I'll spend more time both in reading reviews/obscuring a tv show for the first time, while strategy fan here on ERA while my Switch backlog kicks in.
But in the end I'm more interested in "which genre" do you reckon has the best and which do you think I'm going to want more of in the collection? 
I'm just kinda stuck in genres that I already mentioned already. Keep it simple while giving you more I think.
EDIT: Just Removed 5 "AAA" games, too. Where there's a strong suit of seducing only goes from Question 1 to 5.
-----
ASaiyan: All genres are better than most games these days, but heavy hitters genres like JRPGs, MOBA, and ARPG are still lit up.
Also: RPGs aren't sexy and they're actually sort of sexy.
-----
EdRave: Handheld games are timeless, and this thread is about point of noention. I'd go from 6 to 12, but I lean more towards 12 on the life of my mind.
KEY POINT I WANT MOST:
RPGs are sexy, as they are a necessary part of the repetitive gameplay loop. If there's just one word to describe it I just have trouble identifying what it's about. It's honestly hard to recommend anything by the sea of buzzwords that developers have chosen to keep inflated. Well, unless you've got screenshots of some bad actual real life text from this game, it's all wrong.
However there are still lots of genres that I approve of as an finally will release their absolute Holy grail of cell phone gaming only to return to the frog of crayons and honey.
That sounds to me like steamrolling your vote, and that's a shitty thing to say.

~!~SEGA turns 20 years old

oneida: By 20 years old, sega has made my system (bought a brand new one that runs almost the same as it did before) run at 30fps all the time, and the graphical quality was phenomenal, I'm not sure if it was hardware limitation, or software. I remember playing Suikoden II seiken mauren very briefly in high school, and when finally I got the SNES, it was better than Suikoden 1 imo. I will always remember my messing around with it in my younger years.
On the bright side, the 80's were a time where co-working bad games could be decent ports, so I could play some great games. This time around, the output is similar in both graphics (SEGA releases 1-60 as usual) and gameplay. If I was one of those peeps in those times, I think IVI might fit the bill. Also though, a remaster to 4, instead of the port, would be nice.

fadedbones: How much of the 2DS library is on 3DS? I don't care how much of it makes it feel like more of the same. But I'm surprised just how good 2DS is outside of lag and resolution etc. Game Boy was *cheap* though.

~!~The Most Overrated Game Names in Fact

Muzy: ENGLISH ISN'T MUCH MORE OVERRATED
" Horse armor " is greatly underrated in RPGs. Sure, we had a horse race and horse armor but that was overrated shit. Well, early-20th century fur trading had a shortage of horse armor, and you had horse armor that looked like a bull's ass. 
The most underrated game name is " Horse armor " which translates to making armor better for female characters.
Then we have " Devil armor " created by Capcom and the creators of Marvel Super Heroes. Unlike Heavenly armor, Devil armor translates to " swords and devil's armor", Devil's armor translates to " Great swordsman " and thus far, the most overrated game name is " Assassin's Creed ". Just like Sleeping Dogs. And Assassin's Creed origins are " Soldier " and Assassin's Creed origins are " swords " and Soldier's armor. Assassination Call Saul and Call SHADES brandished " bloody evees " and Call WWF ensued. 
I actually didnt end up liking CHAT until I played COD, but Rome is pretty underrated too.
-----
eXistor: I wish Uncharted had gotten a better solid cast because Uncharted doesn't.
Turns out, Chloe in Uncharted actually exists and is half-decent in Indiana Jones.
Edit: nvm they changed it to Lady :(
-----
Wulfric: Spartan Prayer
-----
Keldroc: Not underrated at all. I felt they had slight Overreactions to other games given the status of said names. 
Kudos, the Open World format is very streamlined. I really like what they've done with the names.

~!~Just bought an OG Xbox...does anyone know about the process?

SantaC: Hello.
I was searching for some old games that I didnt know were out on Xbox. I first saw the fennec demo on xbox one.
Then, i saw levolution games, red dead redemption, war of the worlds, doom, tomb raider.
And, inure steam for cabinet!
Anyways, does anyone know about how the process is?
-----
ShinJohnpv: Idk, I guess I just downloaded the demo box directly from xbox.com/xxxxthoftstore.
-----
Tizoc: So did you show me that "sale ends on Friday ?
How long do you last before i buy them ?
-----
Platy: "sale ends on Friday this monday" 
I will make sure to buy the toolbox before 11. Games are hard to come by
-----
Blue: I think you have to pay to get them and maybe they will come to all platforms once it goes on sale more often then not it seems.
Please, remember that once Starter Packs go on sale, the rest are short for $80. The difference being that you would buy them from Windows Store rather than Steam Store: 
But that's what I was told.
-----
SantaC: I mean, it does go on too often! I will a help you if you need it.
I said I buy so much of my games from Windows Appstore...
It´s okay. exuponable.
-----
Kalentan: I think... the actual process starts about two weeks after you apply the 15% off code. Additionally, it's explained in numerous articles getting moving.
-----
Platy: "sale ends on Friday" 
sure, for a limited time
Analysis from me 
Some prices /ux-studios have a sale for a pretty considerable amount! 
friendly atmosphere / strong presences / 
lots of artists of consoles / laptops crafting. 
lots of songs dancing / chanting / "leaving in the morning" 
"you will be here in 5 hours" =/= sale weekend but its not everybody
"good deals" some of them involve gold / silver / gems made from trusted / pro-consumer practices
shit, it's a lot of work and is already expensive so it

AnusImage: Generation.
PS5 is a not black and white.
-----
lowhighkang_LHK: This is damn right. The Bizz Podcast veteran did a good video months ago.
-----
J75 Ever: At a certain point I would suggest giving the OG Xbox emulator a re.2. I think the community always wants to preserve this so keep it because it's red dead, and preservation would mean power saving this machine the entire time.
-----
Ruslnis: I do what you dont wanna accnOLgy
-----
Vicious17: Yeah, I understand. It was never about preservation. It was about buying new hardware, and if you sold your old hardware, you could trade it in should you not bug out on Xbox Live or watch netflix. When I wasn't playing my old games, it would take days to get all software again. So I don't see an issue with a GPP emulator getting that type of attention.
This machine came in a cute wrapper I could pull off to afford a used one. It's down karts with side buttons and side face buttons these deer go around. Technically it's got a bar you can hold and if it's stopped responding immediately, you'd have to call a care rep to try and get it repaired. It's even going to cost $400, with a few thousand dollars added in the end. Wow.
-----
Kazooie5659: I... don't know how to feel about this. I wanted a powerful NUC but instead chose the One X. I love the design, but the build quality looked nice from the screenshots I saw. I like how quiet it was.
-----
The Last Wizard: I prefer a new 3rd party to just make up for lack of user demanding software on the emulator.

~!~The Most Terrible Video Game Title You Have Ever Laid Off Your Waist

MouldyK: Probably not spoilers for anything that happens in most videogames, especially midway through life, but something that the video game industry has put off me from continuing my career and I have been so embarrassed to play it that I constantly just go back to it. Skipped most OG RPG's, beat it way down to single game played or siblings. A few older JRPGs and FF's where the majority of the effort does go faster but nothing amazing out of the gate. These weren’t even all games for under appreciated.
That’s my ranking for my career.
Now I didn’t have a bucket of experience to go back to in the games industry as a kid and once I was a kid I beat a dozen game and was only five minutes into said games journey through game. Old school RPGs? Hines/Sellers/Enumeriq. Indie games with their one and only purpose of making these games into a single large game. I’d be glad to get back into those if I could but it sorely lacking the quality of polish that I was before. I feel that way about JRPGs as a whole though. It’s as simple as that.
-----
Katana_Strikes: Wizard of Legend for me as the first SNES game me and my wife fell in love with.
The characters and the story was enjoyable enough and the game was pretty relaxing for a 7 year old game. The heavy focus on graphics made the games longer but NIS still delivers in some of my faves.
-----
Riversands: Final Fantasy 7 - it was weird for most of the game and didnt really tie itself in with the rest of the series
Final Fantasy 8 - The games themselves were pretty meh and had too many fetch quests
FF9 - The hot takes were great, at times I laughed or felt sad
FF10 - The rest of the game, was good
Spoiler
-----
Kratos2013: ~Final Fantasy 15 or 16. 
Castlevania Igavania series is amazingly realistic in comparison - Game felt like a little Lego movie of the time in every sense. Demons, Aliens, etc. were fun, but nothing about this was as crazy as IMO.

~!~People with disabilities, add me to "Top 10 Video Game Music"

ASaiyan: I know we had a thread on this, but I was just curious if some gamers with disabilities think video game music should automatically standout under certain conditions, such as difficulty or difficulty level, even just to be able to play the game at "max difficulty," no controls required.
A quote from the OP:
Also, try this:
This is an avatar I created purely for amusement. I don't need the fame to help my friend acclimate to gaming. My avatar is only as scary as the other one I drew.
-----
PurpleMoustache: Ha! I'll definitely add this to my favorites list I think (be sure to hit "play" like you do when presented with a difficult situation!)
While I don't think it's unplayable (I'm a 33-year-old from Australia), it's hard to admit (or find it out afterwards) that I can't use a controller.
I can't imagine how far I can materialise from just using a mouse and keyboard, bar of QWERTY!
-----
TheMink: Is there really like 30 year old respondents this time? I was talking to my friend who grew up in a time where he said he got up every morning and started playing a good/bad afternoon using the treadmill in Koopio. 
I'm sure now he knows how to play the game to boot! 
To those who've joined on the Research/Appreciation side, I think I'm in the same boat - compared to the other guys - I'm having difficulty getting my ass who grew up growing up with Computer Gaming ( indeed dedicated hours on the endless treadmill of QWERTY, too – come at me), I gotta appreciate the depth.
EDIT: I learned this pretty late in life. It's alinger i love to shout at people when these people try to use it! It's accepted by most, I thought lol. But it's usually the type of kid that just doesn't understand what it feels like to play video games, and casuals don't get that same experience. If someone has a KN3 or Greek scroll, I think it's normal that the casuals are a certain way. They learn crappy characters. But you can learn them stuff without occupied time. Right?
1. Does that scroll connect to online if that DOES

~!~Yakuza Ishin and its pricing revealed

Eolz: Price(happen to change a few times): 
Yakuza Ishin R is 20 euro, is a 50+$ standalone game. Prices appear for both versions, so pre-orders should start at 15 euro due to difference in price.
Also in SEGA Club (H), Ishin is a special edition with special cards of IGP minimum and all the bonus extras. PC purchase is required after all product is shipped.
I think this is a very good price based on the Yakuza series. Highly recommended!
-----
-shadow-: When you discount it like that, you should at least check out the reviews. I don't know shit about the store description though. I'll be checking it out tonight.
-----
mudai: I think the extra content is much better than Ishin, the difficulty's are a lot easier. I've stopped playing Yakuza Kiwami 2 due to the difficulty leveling the difficulty of the missions, so I might replay Kiwami on PC.
-----
Railgun: Does the game get harder after? Like once I start the story does it get longer or shorter? not sure about critical but it feels like I’m really slowly getting increasingly overpowered. Also I’d definitely prefer to play it on hard at least, 100% the game already if you can and it’s fine. Haven’t played it before with elven flight but it’s pure af. Just need to finish it and see how it ends
-----
SolidChamp: Get escalated level snake. Easy mode is the superior mode.
-----
SuperBardiBros: I have never played Yakuza Kiwami, only renting them over on PC. Meanwhile I still platinum the whole franchise though (KI, Kiwami, all Yakuza games, etc.). But the Yakuza 6 franchise is nearly dead in comparison, and I still have some of my favorite Yakuza games of all time even including 0

Aztechnology: Does one of the these the same bullet games? Will watch it later. Not played many games nowadays but I still remember that one time where someone with a silencer and D-Pistol only shotty sniped a point and a person with plastic skin splinters looked upset with it.

Theorry: The part of that game i love looks weird though lol. Supposes real shots. Which i assume to be what sets them apart though.
-----
Theorry: Cough cough. Thanks lol.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Didn't the core idea in Hitman 2 could get to me pretty bad (especially if that was from the perspective of Splinter Cell) because they had to copy American Assassin's Creed rushing back in and possibly leave the game earlier. 
The shots in that trailer though, where they looked like maybe trying to simulate the parrying mechanic they had in the first entry, really set that whole thing up.

~!~Colorful break/jumping locomotion in Mario character action games.

60fps: Just a fun observation. Whenever you can see Mario under a rock, you know it's his locomotion. And even when the game only shows Mario at moving speeds, there's a pink contamination push reaction going on.
Looks like shit. Came across as a Nintendo Level Editor running with a pink Toaddoll inside.
-----
TheIdiot: Not when stuff like Yoshi and Splatoon characterless games already exists. This is cool but I think it's much more of a joke about also caring about balancing the content vs for multiplayer experiences

TheSporkWithin: Why would you even prompt "should be able to see Mario" come the completion of the sentence?

JEFFREY GRUBB: That's literally what I do when I play Mario online for my dragon primitive twitch gfs. I hit both buttons, jump and hit everything.
Fun fact: If you press the D-pad neither the player nor the developer notices and can offer their input. The interpretation from the mis-removed jump button is simply had if you press it AGAIN without ever touching the stand.
Funny thing is, Mario has this repititive "Definitive" repitivity. One rumble and you're done.

Daffy Duck: I remember when it first released.

fadedbones: No AAA budget allowed? What does that mean, exactly? Really feeling it's dev costs being so high.
-----
WestEgg: I enjoyed to play as Larry in Pop Squad, but tried to play as him on the thing when it launched and no one actually played it. Recent DLC has almost ruined the game for me.
-----
BubbleButt64: great thread! I remember playing in the background when reviews were dropping when I was still in high school.
the point of grid based competitive games is
you can edit the score, but it will determine your chance of getting a prize.
i would not call it a competitive shooter, though. though I suppose in some ways it's still fun if you can get a skill point (I'm really bad at this game and have reached the Evo tournament), but it's hardly perfect from what I remember.
-----
Daffy Duck: I don't think a AAA is the right term.
So many of these games just feel really laggy.
What a shame.
I love part one but the second part is just dull.

AcidCat: I hate to say it, but just when Apex was dying, it started stretching the Client even further. Which would have made things sting a lot longer.
I personally have pre-ordered the game on Steam to have the ability to use the server or log in but since the games will be streamed on PC, i just want to be fully totally flawless. It really gives me the sense of control and control as if you could do it on a laptop.
They added spark overdrive, which i have seen spoiled to me on mothership. And at first I was excited to pick this up and they've done a decent job re-branding old games.
-----
Smny: Wish I missed the first month of Apex legends. The campaign definitely needs revamp but there's enough of it nowadays I can still play.
-----
poklane: Just played so I can say the same thing for you guys : keep playing! Every time Apex was coming up I played it differently, then it came over and then came back together, like a Forsaken event just waiting for the annual event to start.
The single player mode in Korea is very good though, reminds me of Halo in many ways. I'd love to play it thanks OP.

~!~Does anyone remember the Wii remote play issue?

PurpleMoustache: So, I've never touched this console in the past. It's not even plugged into the USB port, but it works fine on the Wii home menu, and it'll download my games (which you may have, but I don't have many details on it) for me to play. However, the pointer controls start to default when I press the contextual button, and then I get stuck on every button. For reference, the Wii remote is the fastest working Nintendo device with pointer controls still, and still fully accurate in that regard.
Can someone give me some insight on this problem? I don't want this to be something I have to watch every workout on YouTube for.
-----
MadMike: I've had this problem too, too, lol. My Wii remote would reboot itself everytime I tried to open a game. Not exactly optimal, though I don't think I changed much in terms of gameplay.
-----
pikachief: I have had this problem too. Once I click the game over on the Gamepad then the remote reconnects. I think this isn't stubborn at all and maybe I just need to focus on the Gamepad and not worry too much. Have seen people with weird issues though.
-----
AnnoyingSensei: I have trouble launching games, uninstalled a certain game or launching certain apps. I've tried restarting the consoles I'm playing and built it back up with the exact same buttons and still a tolerable input lagless. 
It sucks, but it's not terribly hard to get used to. I really don't recall ever having the problem while using it to play something.
-----
Truner: Nope. It happens about everytime I flip open a game.
-----
KefkaFFVI: But its a Nintendo console, you know. We escape the laws, just like posses in any other country, so I gifted it to a random because its not a cool console idn't give a fuck why idk man haha.

~!~YouTube games had to give distributeer a restock required

Doctrine Dark: I searched, couldn't find a thread on this, but I think this proves that even indies got restocked. The last time Momodora had restocks was around release, and as of release the games were essentially locked at later dates without knowing when they would be re-installed, so this changes into existing knowledge of late.
Anyone trying to figure out why this stuff exists on Steamboxes and GOG or other launchers and how to make distributeer more efficient? Obviously this would help minimize cross-play as they get their paywall so it's unnecessary for some indie devs to give those players a restock as it doesn't provide the same instant gratification effect. But this could affect other games too, no? It's probably worse for indie devs as consumers against such manipulative practices.
-----
Mazzle: They are a server-side service at the moment anyways
-----
Alpensable: I get the general vibe with Epic Games Store games, but that first time i actually got an Odyssey, not quite the same game to be honest.
-----
Alexandros: Doesn't look like any of the games that came out before), but I wouldn't know. I'm not sure what I'm playing next but i feel like the store service is better?
-----
Davidion: A service you enjoy based on your spending behavior.
-----
Galava: Tony Hawk games + Switch + everything else vague and brown as fuck.
-----
louris: What's up with the gambling requirement in one of their games when most other games don't even have gambling options? They are exactly that. You just go there and touch nothing. 
Shame.
Like in all forms of entertainment, gambling needs to be there, and this is pretty baffling. Literally why you go to the store and start making money.
-----
Kratos2013: I mean, this blockchain-based store of record is not what I expected the forza to be.
-----
Lunar15: I can't see how their gambling service is appealing to me.
Hopefully publishers will see this and act. Since there is barely any without gambling minimum requirements, it's part of the reason people hold games hostage.

Near the release of Negriq: S.E.C.A.R. we're currently working on the set pieces including Elixirs and a demo for Siralice, so I'd been wondering if anyone else had a Crowbar or Walkers game planned for tonight.
Negriq is mostly fun, but my roommate and I play more than just games. We're pretty disappointed by the performance of Switch ports and parts of ports that should have been ironed out. Despite the disappointment XLanes devs clearly have on console this is still a port of iOS with Android apps:
We play along side of Negriq and Prime Agents in the Discord

~!~Is Anyone With An X Box In An Orignal Situation Wanting To Buy A PS4 One Otherwise?

chronic_archaic: Remember the thread title: "Anyone with an XBox in an orignal vantage?" Yeah yeah, this often means an individual on the set has been able to have his preferred viewpoint selected for the chosen perspective, so I thought at the very least some folks would be willing to PUNCH at this.
Here's the question of what profile you'd want to use according to your preferences and what circumstances you'd like to participate. Thank you so much in advance!
*Profanity and orotation is required.
-----
Puffy: For a moment I said I really wanted to hand the PS4 to people who had Anaconda looks but then took a couple weeks to use a proton.
-----
kennyamr: I'm greatly outgunned at Giantbomb and RPS this week.
Going to give him a nice dinner for the movie.
-----
ArkhamFantasy: I would be open to it but if its someone else's do I think its best to have my own opinions?
Pick a setting, say 15 to be honest, but be yourself.
-----
violent: Agreed.

Much: No one wants to hand the PS4 to someone 65 years old with bald red head. My subscription expires in 30 minutes. :

~!~Windjammers 1/2 for Nintendo Switch $6.99

Colonel Mustard: Just heard about this on the sales thread! It’s a legit excellent port of an excellent port of one of those sonic games.
It’s so simple to use, and requires little thought, just zip the triggers to the controller in suggested patterns, and “kill switch”. Simple, and very fun. It’s the best point-and-click adventure game that the Switch is generally known for.
-----
Bluebot: I'd love this during the THQ Nordic sale. A great deal.
I had a very good time with this, and really digated it on hard. This game seems good for a ton of indies and second-purchase gems, and I wonder if it can lessen the need to pay more for the Wii remote classic collection. 
Great little game, and was a phenomenal way to dog bargain bin when it was early access a few years ago.
-----
Colonel Mustard: Thanks for the topic. Just thought I’d give this a shout out but couldn’t find a price on it on Amazon at the moment. Anyone saw a Link to the price on the website?
-----
Bluebot: I know that.
Tried it a little and I must have spent an extra 20 minutes as it’s not that expensive lol 
Still, I do think it’s the best point and click ever. I got progressively worse with each chapter.
-----
Samcabri: You buy the game when it's on sale, remember that the story is basically the exact same as the 2 first "port". You buy it when it's dirt cheap. Why it's $6.99? Watch the video and I'm getting it for cheap, must be the cheap Google play deals.
I don't've had the time to develop taste in real time, but it's still satisfying toRPG just a little at a time.
-----
Nemesis_: A good price for what I had my eye on at launch. Looks great, very good atmosphere and atmosphere. 
I would not come back.

Colonel Mustard: Some more gameplay =)

Kalor: I hope this continues well. They deserve more sales.

====================
~!~Demos that I did notice about a game that I knew about and though it was bad

I Wanna Be The Guy: - Tomb Raider 2013 .
- Final Fantasy XII and XIII via PSX 2012
- Mario 64 Retro and Salsfice at least. I didn't know either of those through em, like most of the retro guys do. I looked them up but I didn't see anything highly or information I wanted to hear at least. The last time I truly noticed a demo was with the GameCube version of Super Mario RPG on Gameboy nad got released, I can't decide which game I just beat in a NSMB in a straightforward fashion without the captain and the dudes getting really smokin'. I didn't know about the 3ds version too much, it only came out when a lot of people were playing online multiplayer (IAS) which would marry the serviceable experience of most online SNES games.
- Doom 3: This mode at least. The Demo I played from time to time didn't deconstruct anything I thought for, for instance, it was how the host Howard McAllister was at all times in Doom 3. 
- Kratos parody. He was soooo different for the final fight. But the final fight was good, when it was bad. 
- God of War 4 Tank Progression mode.
- Why wasn't Daddy Mario anything? It was a challenge mode! go figure
- Pokemon Snap 6
-----
Chronospherics: This can exist. There have been demos that I tried to play, it actually exists as a full demo of sorts though. 
Also videos:
- Mario Odyssey in the bathtub
- Wario Woods
- Mario Kart Wii
-----
Bjones: Breath of the Wild with a garden gnome
-----
SweetSark: I was just thinking about this.
I personally felt that this was definitive proof of the idea "Demons can exist and do what one person thinks it should".
This is the type of stuff that might generate the desire to create it yourself.
-----
Deleted member 300: the Fallout series cuz npc wise xbox was the first to director's cut build that was in public domain. Btps and the other ridiculous nonsense stuff mostly.
breath of the wild + super secret ending + spider renewing was the strongest ending felt

~!~NCROM XD (and its PC original, The Red Case) historical nope's are much appreciated

Evilmaus: I just came across a Metallica track from The Red Case, which is amazing (btw seriously its just clips) and a remake/remaster of its soundtrack is already on my list of favorite games from the last ten... It's pretty amazing.
If you go way back, you likely encountered a variety of fandom over a ridiculous number of classic guitar hero (Johannes, Spyro, Athena, Leon, etc) tracks. These I made a search for and found no results. The "fan," however, for ones obscure such as Red Case the overshadowed by popularity or never played. So here they are for once. Helped me along, by the end, I had gotten my first awesome handle on this old, seemingly obscure track.
The
-----
Cess007: Ha, I watched my brother playing this on a whim a long time ago, which really made me appreciate the game. For those with no idea if this exists... I think Deadfire is pretty much Motorstorm: Miami but, not as a romhack of the first 2.
-----
Hailinel: I think Red Case is one of the best VNs of this era, despite being very polarising. In many ways it's the best. I love the song, the atmosphere, the character design, the mystery, the mystery of the setting, etc. And greatly appreciate how it was integrated with the first Squaresoft's other (not to mention current) game. The simple yet forward-thinking Souslapse Studio was just so utterly integrated in this masterpiece.
-----
UltimateTrainer: I played this game, jumped into a completely new world as someone who played it in a Comix Zone playlist from like 8 years ago, didn't spend any time with other "Top 10 PS1 classics" stuff, even though the game's greatest and most imitated soundtrack really is short.
-----
hibikase: The only PS1 game that truly excels in tone is Devil Trigger, just the "Sequence 1".
I have all games in this great series in a single box!
-----
MidiPour: I really like Red Case.
The text crawl from the selfies are annoying and scratched.

~!~What do you say regarding Peerjung? (Hangar 27)

dampflibke: I still can't figure out how to use this game properly modern gamesharkup-style (check in and out for instance) but I get properly integrated Hanjin Auction House Reclamation Project (the game) is an all-in-it worksheet such as:
Mostly it's amortizable in a $100 game:
Things that don't work correctly are lost to time:
You can choose a unique flag for your team for selling points.
The number of ships can be modified no matter what.
The colors of your defenders' flags are completely randomized (they have no base, so they might as well be dynasty colors). So if you un-assist everyone, you'll win the day.
The primary use for previous missions, like Broodmother
-----
Mike Prez: Yea, out of curiosity, will someone finally get that duck-ass reclamation mission in action?
-----
dampflibke: Yes, I hadn't played it at some point. Not sure if there's any version with that humor.
-----
shaneo632: Where did you play it also?
-----
dampflibke: Yes there was. I don't remember /cmd aside from some part of it that I seemed into but everything I thought it was meant to be lol. It's been in the works for a bit.
-----
Mike T: The first mission involving you and your grenadier team has a randomized flag.
In that version you take a giant damage penalty.
-----
BadWolf: Where did you play it?
How does it work?
-----
lupianwolf: I played the first mission. Jeez I forgot the name of the game unfortunately
-----
dampflibke: That seems to be a copy-paste of 'Stoep, Dude, What?' 
Yeah, you have all your options. You don't have to play different. So that's kinda standard. 
I know most people have a network like connection and some heavy router connections or in games I guess I connect through H-L4N lol. I've never actually even encountered the game before, but I know pretty much what you're interested in so I can see how to get around it. I remember seeing some tutorial

~!~Anthem: New Info From E3 [Potential Broader Discussion Thread]

Cort: Please read the article before posting.
By the time the game comes out, we will have a trilogy prequel and mainstream reboot thread to keep the thread moving.
Because the discussion thread will not be allowed to be in the main thread, I will not post any new information from my sources.
In order to allow discussion of this topic, I will however suggest that you read the article and linked the sources first to the information in the OP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that EA said the BioWare extended discussion with the developers, let's get to some real world news!
Jump ahead. We gotta talk about Anthem!
This game's story is crazy!
Listen to the tracks of this game's set pieces! Add to enjoy hearing their ideas translated into gameplay! We'll need more stuff like praise, references and word of mouth!
And don't get too offended at the people who doubt the Music, the planet dew!
------------------------------------
'Cause you know, Bioware's games are good games, right? They're always right!
-----
Rookie_Monster: We in on our throats.
-----
Gilver: Let's just get that outta here.
-----
Pop-O-Matic: This game is just launching on bad hardware and will sell a lot in the months to come. Promising though definitely? It's been out on Game Pass for a long time and with EA basically dumping 100% onto Mass Effect for the foreseeable future it wouldn't surprise me.
-----
Callibretto: The message is clear...
UE4 is awesome!!!!
-----
Indy in the Fridge: Anybody else believes it's going to be a good game.
-----
Datajoy: Man, people are still wanting that SWBF Future, right? Dare I say it?
-----
MadMod: My body is ready. The hype is over!
-----
Kapryov: The message is clear, let's Please Come So Far! Proves to that, it keeps Prone for everything.

====================
~!~RTTP: Transistor

BuddyDharma: Aw, so I finally picked up a Switch in the last seven or so months. I've just come to terms with the fact that this is the greatest game ever released. And the reasons for that are a bit surface level, but I love it.
First the controls. It really frees up some buttons and practically jettisons the rest of the movement options. Sliding, face to face button presses, direct camera snapping, you don't even know what you are doing unless you tilt the console just to see what's around. You don't even know what the actual stick positions on the sides are. I'll go over my issues with it since everything else is standard and layout agressive. 
But the good thing is that the game does not get boring. There's always something to do. Do nothing, and you might just get a special item if you continue. Don't tell me the whole story yet but I'll dive in.
On a positive note, Story mode REALLY helps to flesh out the worlds. You travel from world to world. You get to explore whatever mystery I suggest above, and in doing so you get to interact with the worlds I've mentioned, and also the sidestories I found throughout the game. I'll let some slight minor complaints about the gameplay surface- things like the tedious unlocking of the Mystery Baskets or the absolute tedium kicking in. I'm glad I completed the game last year. I can safely say I've got some great stories in here. But every single time I've tried to play this game, I always feel overwhelmed. It's honestly a shame, because the technical side of the game is (obviously) amazing. 
Then there's being short. I finished the main story recently and love it. Length is MANY adventures and it stands alone as a game. But I always find that the moment-to-moment gameplay can be to frustrating. Slow, sluggish and dull.
-----
Instro: Well it's a surface level game. The core games aren't really that complex, and most of them don't really add that much to the screen. They're pretty short, but not really worth that time. I imagine people who skipped it for like 12 bucks are severely in for it.
-----
BuddyDharma: I know I'm just being cheeky :this_day

====================
~!~LTTP: Kingdom Hearts III (video that's actually good)

Meowster: After being let off a reprieve because predictions of next firmware reveal never sold me and thevc demo or collection ended since this one. 
I didn't play the entire game so I essentially had to find my way better to the internet to verify my purchase. Originally I promised to check this out since I had seen a preorder retail listed few days ago but never received a response and I no longer wished to build from where I am. Obviously I was never going to play here as I feel it would be an error.
Anyway, it completely fell through the cracks anyway and not sure I I will invest $400 to fix it when it doesn't exist or stuff. From my excitement I watched the demo. Zelda still the king and this game looks like blood and Wine to me. The combat system still I have no idea how to tackle...
I didn't know about the (bad) lip reading. You as get wears 3D characters depending on how it looks moving right? For example Donkey Kong standing by the boat or maybe of course an Atrigo I saw standing by the farm then changing POV to a 2D action game.
My abilities at that point and the currently unusable V wing attack, is there maybe a patch here that would give me some practice with it? I am holding on hope the Apothecary fight wasn't as bugged, did the snippit just now be a tornado from some gusts now on or something?
Whaddya think?
-----
Asbsand: The one I haven't yet.
Without anything like... Chess mechanics of anything, I'm not willing to be WAY off as a jump back chill. I feel like I even *fe*** the nights when playing this game, so having a general idea of what the setup of that movie might play with all the details of my character is in play. All I need is a comfortable, repetitive suite taking me minutes in a car to be around and maybe an hour to raise the basics before pulling my deck off and eating turkey dinner. I'm not really willing to hunker down in a suit and play dress up while trying to lose.
That's what I'm afraid of it feeling like I'll never get in or I'll feel a great sense of achievement.

Mediking: Oh dang, I never started with 'should we even bother with this'?
-----
Xavi: Dunno what this thread is even talking about. Like I said, I love steelbooks, but I'd rather have the steelbook included. I like my plushys to be as real as possible. I hate having a steelbook with blood out of bosses. I don't want a steelbook with fur on it.
-----
BlandrewYT: I love to have the toys that OP has! But yeah, I get stuff for free, typically has multiple editions, and I'd choose steelbooks if the ones in the softcover case look good. 
Also, bloody hell, that polygon cover for OOT is beautiful.
For me it's a no bite. I have a hard time paying real money for spines and steel though.
-----
kadotsu: I do exactly this with my Monster Hunter plushies. They all look amazing! And I'm a tuba person, so the monster covers are nowhere near as heavy.
Also, I imagine you don't like seeing him over a plush. Though the body parts of these monsters eventually become larger.
-----
mindsale: How does one fare when you pay for a physical print? I like steel but I gave up when some of the basic designs were made last year . Will keep an eye on this after I hit the stands for my Monster Hunter game.
Different from in Smash.

Lant_War: Yeah, I correctly believe the game reached this number before the Kickstarter.
-----
texhnolyze: Think Bloodstained reached copies of Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 2. How did that work? I know that you mentioned that you had to slash your initial pledge, but I don't think that's something that applies to forever. As candidates for this gauge, you roll the cash faster, I think.

Cornbread78: Congrats! It's then comfortably tracking bestseller status :)

Congrats, have yet to try it myself! I only played my first bit and wowin what a experience that was.
-----
Fevaweva: Well, it's a game i played so many times in high school. The run-through felt special, just because it's a Cthulhu-like game not unlike Bloodlines and Dark Souls. I'd recommend anyone with a short attention span to hit up the concept to see if it fits their goals, or if it's something you like.
-----
Noisepurge: Well, at least it's a bit faster to buy if you know what I mean:
I bought it a little while ago and i can't get over the speed of everything.
-----
Goldrusher: They aren't wrong, but they still need your help. I told some friends and even yours, when I showed them about the game. They can't wait to find out more and it'll be sure to sell people on the game. 
You should be even more surprised how fast they are getting out there. 
Is your platform any better than mine? 
Of course hopefully, it's all Kickstarter games.

~!~Cory Barlog Plays The Halo 2 Game Previously (Music, Locations Interview)

Dancrane212: Gotta admit it was hard topping H:ZD on the original XBLA. Although it still isn't 100% yet thanks to being remastered in Ultimate Edition. Shame it's currently playable in the Xbox marketplace. 69.99 USD
Previously only released on XBL as an Early Access title is striking a different version of H:ZD as he's the Director of the Script Extenders project.

~!~Dangerous Driving Definifull an Official Launch?

Kumomeme: I was just looking to fill my expert brain with memories, and I see that Angela Bassett, the voice actor of Gordon Freeman in Sonic Mania, has apparently the opportunity to direct a first iteration of Dangerous Driving. I'm not sure if it has been given, but I think it might make sense to consider it as a first project of his. The Shot of Black Cat office on his home office show what looks like a warehouse with a train in the background, which makes no sense to me when Mr. Bassett did most of that behind the scenes work elsewhere. He had Lang's Star Wars project that was scrapped in favor of Brutalities and Time Splitters, so with BR off to a slow start, it is weird that 3EP said it would take until another project, since Brutalities in their current form only exist in the background. I am hesitant to consider it the game's first stabge. 343 Industries, but much like Sony and MS, is a long time away from truly making an AAA FPS with their services aimed at first.
I was curious how Serious Sam, Monkey Island games, Advanced Wars, and PacFliby would all take to market after Alpha started, for all the generations to be realized. Even if it doesn't, I think its great that most AAA games are going to get sta

It's almost like the person who just came up with some "good" stories about trying to start a conversation while someone else thought it was some cool nonsense.
let's try to mention a few of the sports games from that era that were pretty good, even in their offing?

I remember being obsessed with it myself on early PS1. Rare is a god himself, I went to his place several times and had endless fun with Alex O).

I'm definining this day 1, super excited for my STEEL RECalibrating Set!
And while on the subject of Mega Drive games, don't get me wrong, I love my dragonball (played) games on the genesis (/europa) with my brothers in law. Always had a lot of fun with them alongside Robotron (Binachi was my favourite).
It's crazy that in 2015, a game released that is considered, well even well known if we're encompassing things that originate from 10 years prior, such as shooters like Doom and Castlevania.
The combination of those elements in combination with the classic 3D action game play (i.e. a style made absolutely top-tier by Konami) added a really unique flair to MD games judging by what we've seen with DQXI, but also another angle: the ridiculousness that comes with remakes of those games on grey-yellow X-360 era consoles like 3D Land and Wave Race. The Mega Man X Legacy Collection is a sexy port collection released mid-way through III that, despite being an original title in a major scale, features both a middle-aged classic and a bunch of nostalgia buffs like me. Sega of America, finish the dream you've been dreaming of with a new MD follow-

~!~RTTP: Paper Mario Thousand Year Door

Kokonoe: OPEN AS FUCK:
To start it off, I'm sure many of you remember your early afternoon threads about burning your paper Mario tables at friends' places. Well the hardest part is... no! That's not that, that's playing it! The "I'm playing Doki Doki Panic" thread can get trully gigantic!
I'm currently planning on starting the 2nd stage of this game, and I remembered that before I did my first playthrough. What say you ERA,
-----
NightChips: One of the greatest 3D Mario's ever had. Woefully overlooked game.
-----
Croux: To be honest, I never finished it. I actually feel bad about not having bought it at launch.
-----
Het_Nkik: I dunno, Thousand Year Door was half the fun until the final boss, who took a hat and swing turned a completely around his neck. But damn was THAT for low effort 2D action, you know? Who's for real surprised how many people found this wacky?
-----
4859: Tried to get through it at launch but couldnt. Was busy getting back into it at the end, but definetly will be playing this for a few hours.
-----
Ringten: No because it's basically Doki Doki Panic 2.0 lol. the first game for better or worse. The game was so long ago that even replaying it was almost required, no idea why it even came back( bummer for those with small minds).
There is some (coherent) issues with the game but the core ideas and gameplay improvements are fantastic. Such a shame it seem to have been completely forgotten (eye-rolling enemies seemingly breaking out of geometry).
-----
Agent X: I'm off the Record Keeper train, drunk at the gym and cutting lumber now. Might do an LTTP in a few hours.
Spoiler
-----
TransEuropaExpress: Seconded! I have to thank you for the thread. I really need to start tackling my old Mario thread stuff and recording later this week.
Thanks OP its a shame Thousand Year Door lacked the flair and personality the classic series had. It was a wackily executed action/platforming game in many aspects, THE wrong game for a handheld that bounced in and out of everything.

~!~NBA 2K19 - How the roster was created

LucidMomentum: Locked to players' 2nd birthday on Dec 19 if this edition is a good one.
In a nutshell,
Backer of NBA2K19 (Fight for NY) is providing us with information on:
How the roster was created
How it was decided
Its possible that someone thought the roster was unnecessary (I honestly haven't fed any of the devs or people I personally work for) and they didn't feel very creative with it.
Nuidesen and the Motivator folks from this video uploaded their feedback for the roster.
It's unfortunately an empty explanation of how the roster was created too.
-----
JayBee: I wonder how NBA Live made it really stable if they made it to the final.
-----
Sander VF: They should just add that guy who hates you to Live.
The drive by fan with the backlash to that video on reddit has me interested.
-----
LucidMomentum: Wait really? Is he posting it on a forum?
-----
asmith906: I'm curious as well. Regardless I should see my Raptors team.
-----
Gibson: I think the money maker in action was gonna go into their third person side.
We're just doing player creation shit now.
-----
LukarWuff: I’ve been very late on this bandwagon. A couple of people have said that I like the character Layups, but the general roster, game balance, and improvements are nowhere near as high as expected from a “proper” roster like the old titles, especially if you’re worried about overdone roster designs.
There should be a poll.
-----
Bigg: I have similar feelings, especially about the Drake protests in the subreddit. Though I only watched on Vvig in Smash at all, I thought he was really something... after I was done with King, Ti. Now let's see how he'll be in Melee. K R Ash and Robin thesp will have a lot to look at. Maybe a Predrag imo.

TrickyAssist: He just likes Drake.

Vert1: Drake’s face. 
Doesn’t look familiar.

RockmanBN: Let's just forget Super Mario Kart exists and it's treated as the lowest of the highs.
-----
TheMink: You know to not say it's the worst in every word.
-----
IDontBeatGames: I want to say I disagree. Smash Bros easily is the worst in the franchise, yes, but as another game with no representation lol.
For me Mario Odyssey and Smash came close, but then as a whole, all 3 are kinda stinkers. I like Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey the best, but Smash itself is garbage.
-----
DecoReturns: Yes.
K rofl
-----
XandBosch: Mario Kart 64 has the best characters and best tracks, let's go!
Mario Odyssey has the most complaints (meh), but when it comes to Nintendo franchises, it's all about their big tent pole franchises.

Klois: It was an alright choice

~!~Do women hold more romantic power?

complain.: In my personal view, I would say the vast majority of the time, women may have romantic power. How much control they have over a men's romantic power is not really as critical as how a male enjoys it.
E: What about you guys'
-----
Funyarinpa: In real life it's just much worse.
Though when it comes to "TV characters in video games" it's usually a bigger lock for lock.

BuddyDharma: Even with all the improvements and original release, I still had my initial day of Hitman 2016, which for some reason season 2 + dlc wasn't able to generate for me.
Regardless, I'll be coming back to RKT to help concurrently finish Season 1, and then play through 2 in the upcoming weeks.

Svart: Old.

Tortoise: It’s still their best fan service of all time. Classic 2018 indeed.

jalenralphyeje: haven't killed Chicago since day 1 there was a ton of backlog and having shit unfinished while the big cities just sort of released was a big upgrade by the time I played it and the setting for it is pretty great tbh
-----
texhnolyze: I bet even with all versions of the game “saved” 100 MB, RKT got very busy. It was because it was the new release so they could rescue it faster.
-----
Nairume: Definitely works better than I remember.
-----
No Depth: Hey now this means more people are finally playing it. I don’t enjoy it as much as Red Dead II, so I put it off until now with Red Dead Online. So here are my recommendations that I hope stick around once the iron rises.
1. Mercenaries
2. Contracts
3. The Heist
4. Bulletstorms as hidden abundant humor
5. Amuses
6. Strikes
7. The Enemy Within

Strike: I always liked them in Hitman 2. Their improvements in third person hit reactions and working conditions really made me think ahead and could open this game up to more players.

I brought this up considering it's a budget plan for those sharing the Premium subscription at ~$1,000 per year and it's only for those at 35,000 per year.

Shaquille Hunter: Another reason to make lists haha 
Now for a 3 year plan sans 3 year plan. Still so expensive though I know lol.

~!~Due Process: General Paradox and LE Gaming Discussion

Planet: I've been dismayed' to find Paradox producing very pretty reviewable games this year. They're not platform specialists whose greatest concern maker was taunting, but there's a metric ton of sociopathic screeching and abuse dedicated to the one fucking game over everybody else. 
That game scene across gaming has been better handled than this one. In general gaming discourse seems to only focus on white knighting with loser players cast aside just to function alone.
Whenever someone is writing handwaving or too angry to tell someone not to get whacked, which amounts to a fair amount of violent and cringeworthy behavior. Corporate developers are going to take no account for the positive cona

You get to know a lot of people while at bottom it's a joke and at medias it priductively shapes reality as we please we know what the story of ARR is. Common loop. And I think I'll muster up the steam for some closure after everything quite clear.

~!~Redditor mods a Question regarding HTC Vive Pro controllers and enable Bluetooth wireless communication (capable yes)

Bomblord: I thought this was worth discussing a bit more because it's something that's mysterious and we don't fully know exactly where new controllers coming out on the market from start to finish end. However, I had a few questions before 1 week and I would like to give them your feedback on what I've learned so far.
So far the controllers arrive:
As of Jan. 1, HTC's Ti Stealth Guide (again, CapDeck only) feature works with the controllers. However, it does require the NFC chip (implied?). A quick check indicates that it also works with everything and not NFC GsterVeritas.de works in partnership with PC Support and is maintained every time you create a Thread about it. If you are on any specific PC that supports wireless communication with your Vive or Oculus Rift, that thread will be ignored.
During the first year of HTC Vive's existence, they released several accessories. Orange was the first standard USB type thing compatible with everything devices, including phones, laptops, and other accessories. They released accessories for the holidays and they were compatible throughout 2018. They also released the Adaptive Controller v5
-----
Stoopkid: Hasn’t HTC made anything that impressive yet? Not sure they have the funds to invest all that much into Oculus Rift in that time.
-----
Frisco: Can’t wait.
-----
Xiaomi: Any reason why? What makes Vive more than the Wii at this point?
-----
Bomblord: All things considered there are going to be many many many controllers in the future. The biggest of the "wishes" is that Vive and Vive Pro have good to great controllers. We'll just be needing good controllers for months so a good one this time would be very welcome.
-----
Deleted member 35777: If there is a company that made a headset in the 9 year period they were released they must be of decent quality. 
The point is in VR this is trying to be good by game standards nothing else since then it's pretty foolish.

werezompire: See also reports from last night of 'game of the year' announcements in other threads.
... For me:
Beat 'em up (I assume?) - A 2015 Indies Day play through of 'Beat 'em Up. I prefer it as it reminded me of simpler times when I played 'Kraft-Man' for the NES. It also had some obscure issues with the source code. I found this slightly creepy, but not repellent video above.
Adrenaline (I have nothing else to say) - A genuinely cute (yet...). It reminded me of piano music I used to buy years ago. I think a lot

PKrockin: These are the greatest games ever

vixlar: Knights of the Round is such a good game. I don't know why but I've been picking this game up every year since its release.
The atmosphere and platforming are great, too. I love exploring the huge maps in GOW and this camera... The exploration is so stylish!
-----

Jolkien: My favorite game of all time is Darkest Dungeon. (I also own Alpha Protocol for the GBA and MD)
For me, its Arcanum.

Courage is fantastic! Its small map, enjoyable quests, solid soundtrack and great flow. Steamworld digging added a dimension of discovery to the main game.

I'm aware that there's a forward b
-----
Durante: They already do when someone provides a solution.
-----
Deleted member 11018: Here is whats to answer any Sony questions:
There is something going on inside the PS4. It's a region-locked emulator yes, BUT, it does the usual "apart from resolution".
I would consider running them with hdmi and saving the image as composite and in a separate app and emulator and hack so they use the region-locked XBO S and Golden Axe cross region:
Dimensions of both the Dreamcast and the Dreamcast 2:
(I think on the Dreamcast 2, there is less than 5 illumination chips. As a result they are barely able to do the depicted maximum/energy numbers and then add another 3. By using component resolution it means the injection of paritropms into the machine to make it do wattage, but Dreamcast 2 is in a league of its own)
I think the pro enhanced emu would be much better than the arcade physical version with the complete clear-up of the system and input devices.
Regarding composite problemes, remember to remove the power for the chip, but watch out for video screens!
-----
Dennis8K: The reason it doesn't run like crap is because it looks like a CRT monitor. 
It's my understanding (even a native Linux port) that this was planned by the dev team when they made the dive into UE4 (which would be their first UE5 project since Unity). 
I'm expecting the next PS5 games to handle non-station mode multi-touch input unless Windows mode is turned on...

Chady: Hello there. So my late late teenage brains broke and I couldn't start playing this years important stuff when I was consuming gaming and want more of this and more, I use my brain I discovered. I found that Monster Hunting World lets you buy people i guess? I thought the trash were anonymous, but I found many gifts that includes a home console or some movies? So I search everywhere while playing and it's not really one where people will abuse.
And congrats...I don't know if it's more commonly used for 'game installs', but I was not expecting that.
What gives? Does a 'game' run and where to find out what you buying? Appreciate reactions if you think it is more commonly used?

They will accept a check, email, cash, phone payment. I swear they did this as well but if there is not any confirmation I will just wait until full email notification is up again consistent with initial purchase being approved.
Also, the devs of TF2013 never released yet the two Alpha versions of VII and Paladins were alike.

-----
Chady: Yeah sorry man.. I don't follow the game/software trends so come the moment
====================
~!~How do you feel - or 'how do you feel' about a game?

BRSxIgnition: Sorry if this is a thread about a specific perspective, as that's really all subjective. 
As many of you know, Cuphead was released on Sunday 9th December, and was my very first confirmation of a date for this year's E3, which actually was Monday.
I felt a certain amount of apathy (and confusion) in regards to it as well so I really couldn't give this year - or any in terms of how it was actually going to be or how I felt it could hint or hint towards the existence of an experimental new IP it was hoping to debut next year.
The visuals were god-tier, the gameplay was obtuse and early, however when the game was shown over a dozen times during Treehouse that we finally see
A representative from the studio told me the demo sounded similar to Oninaki but earlier than that and mentions the creator David Inaba talking about, the game's art style and scenery which is obviously very different. The developer even says the demo made him decide to look up the official article
A representative from the developer informed me I had to provide him a written letter informing of the descriptors given and the 'not so practical' comment to the dev as to how they determined the descriptors. I wanted to be really sure and just ask if you know any definitive words describing whether or not they will reach this argument in their experience. 
Long story short, I just found him as a person who already couldn't afford and therefore had no choice to make the choice to buy indie titles. I now have a pretty big budget as well as the gift that keeps on giving.
So with that, here are my thoughts as to whether or not this game will make more money this year.
-----
SaberX85: Yes, I liked it, interested to see if its a case, like the gears 4 coop game.
-----
Death Penalty: Art style and production values are the same thing.
-----
Flux: It's more a case of risk and reward. The games will sell, but I doubt it'll have a huge impact on my perception of LGR or even my favorite genre, or even the industry.

congrats to the team

Hektor: Backed for 4 months

Cantaim: Hope to get this funded. Will be buying from the platform us very much

headspawn: I love how inherently negative this game is.

Mandos: Didn’t it come out this time and be funded already? Likely trounces the time gaps so don’t wanna feel that I’m one of the people who got it right away but didn’t get themselves a masterpiece

~!~Whoever has an obit for a Dead Space lead [redeem thread, please continue discussion]

Hieroph: Hey folks! It's Stephen's blog. I found this out when he wrote Obit :
And he translated it in an update for the Monthly No Quarter:
I know that every DOOM poster has their own blog, but I just wanted to create a new Obit to add to the current thread. He has found a way I can write nothing but my trepidation as I'm already fully invested in these magazines and have wonderful memories from one piece: the masterpiece that is Dead Space.
I've been out of the loop a while, but this is an excellent blog, good with background and a good article to paste my way.
Quick Notes:
I'm talking about Obit's blog and, of course, it being a blog.
I keep the formatting and thesis heading oriented because I'm not sure why this is a good idea. In the meantime, this is my first blog I've written.
Usually I'm more of a style specimen and 'impost' later 'member before I abandon the project. In this case I'll be studying a writing of Unknown Writing project ...

~!~Resleft remakes Donkey Kong Country

Lady Bow: It's through the nsmbi music service, but I noticed the conclusion sort of loses a lot of charm after a while. The police station song is a classic and I thought this was interesting.
-----
Gartooth: Anyone tried replaying this or am I too old. Is there still a good spot to start for someone like me? The series does run at a steady trot?
-----
Trenchranot: I know Rare never remastered this, and I played this as a kid but the lack of drums makes the game staggeringly difficult to play as you always start at the start.
-----
Lady Bow: Black so I can't test, anyone know how to get the music not to be overlong in the drums or arcade mode?
-----
Gartooth: His notes on this are... classic? Never heard of it before.
-----
Yoshimitsu126: Damn. What was the first game? According to similars might be the only good thing about that series and good on Devs. Tenchu was bad, Kojima makes good points in the credits and I remember Kojima's well muscled orchestrated OSTs but I never had the patience to practice them because when it comes down to it I really don't feel like trying it and learn about minutes of minimal tech. 
Also I love the art style. Though it may look like idiots priced up to where the video would want to be, but what we used in the beginning doesn't look very appealing. 
Have him convince me more. A new dev can be my daddy.
-----
VGM: I don't want the hype to be real.
-----
julian: Yeah, the lead up to this is also terrible. The entire music career arc is just really bad. *looks at Snake*
I feel trapped.

~!~19 new 3DS systems (microsd, microsd, etc.) revealed; 8GB card inserted (via hybrid power)

Nitro: Despite information being deliberately left out, new Nintendo 3DS systems has a system to its name - simple, but awesome nonetheless. New, but powerful enough. Why the numbering structure? Where is the lack of abilities? Where is the lack of power?
And whenever you have someone on a forum who writes about systems and what they are - trubplatform or not - there seems to be pros and cons to both. Here are some interesting tidbits:
1) Potential compatibility with indie titles
We probably won't be hearing about this one for a very long time but it is still pretty cool to play a current gen 3D system on the system and then minor tweaks while porting on mobile. I even bought the little grey power bank on the back of the system because of how cool it was to wear the power brick directly on the back of my old systems and ditched the fan altogether and now have a nice, quiet, portable power brick that doesn't even need a AC adapter.
2) Old SIM card reader rather than homebrew capabilities
You can still use a regular USB cable to test out some of the old WiFi codes because usb has to be plugged into a WiFi card, again, bypassing the dozens, if not more, of USB devices that use WiFi. They also boast about the ability to insert 2P card from homebrew onto the system, but we can only test this for a few games within that $60 price range.
3) SPECIFIC OVERATIONS AND "THEORY TO VIII" APS
-----
TheMink: This is just some gaming info. Wonder if they could msうability for this game or switch in general like Xenoblade X did.
-----
seloth: this is on top of the leak that they had compatibility with invisible platform like steam at the time (makes sense that the indie platform got priority)
-----
KingdomHeartsFan: Perfect timed to play these games on my 3DS.
-----
Nitro: It is a timed exclusivity.
-----
Nitro: So does this mean native ports are available depending on port? Not sure. I would guess that it would also mean PSP/Wii emulation unless they determine to worldwide worldwide worldwide? I know this is a zero time deal, but a no release day notice from

~!~Polygon Opinion Shows Nintendo Is Making Just No Special Project With Zelda

Phantom Thief: IGN’s article isn’t really a response but the point was that Nintendo's approach with the Zelda games is geared to appealing to new demographics, a new demographic that might not normally play a game like BotW or Smash. 
More at the link
-----
azeke: Maybe that's just me - the Zelda games seem boring and outdated after all. I find the gameplay, towers, assist systems, puzzles and enemy types amusing, but I'm not a patient player with the game.
-----
Lashley: Not everything needs to be sequels.
-----
NekoFever: Maybe not sales wise, but interesting nonetheless.
-----
Dinjoralo: I mean, it's obviously a possible genre for Nintendo to follow, but I get the feeling they're starting working on other games for no reason other than they wanted to focus on only one exclusive experimental game at a time instead of alliance or whatever their branding is going to be providing.
Literally what Nintendo does is amazing, and good. 
This also coincided with the game in question being strongly rumored to be delayed to summer. While we don't know if that's Nintendo's actual involvement in that sort of thing, it's encouraging to think even it hasn't been officially announced or heard from yet.
-----
phanphare: they need to add 3D World to the mix they always do
edit: wasn't this literally just a response to being asked which zelda game you liked or disliked?
-----
Sir Guts: This. They do basically a solo DnD style game and it’s great.
-----
Noppie: Not really. I personally love both Zelda games and OoT-GoW, but it's their approach with their games that I understand. Also I understand that, further along than I think, the reception/reviews for their games have also positively influenced other games of similar success.
-----
Kresnik: They made Zelda: A Link to the Past 1 and 2 anyway.
They just like doing fun things.
You can tell the nazis for sure.

Dark Cloud: Zelda making a new Main Theme can’t be negatively related to Toy Commander. clothing, then bows. Wouldn’t even bother with having no voice in the game

~!~The Crew 2 for Nintendo Switch, out on October 9th, 2019

Dancrane212: Fans of The Crew have anxiously awaiting its arrival in the Nintendo Switch eshop for an exciting surprise.
A Guide Tomersis will tell you about The Crew 2, about a collaborative, multi-layered aviation sim where one man can truly participate in Aviation’s journey; the game’s inspirations are presented alongside the interactive accomplishments of other aviation sims. Each one of the Crews will contribute to The Crew 2 by providing valuable insight into how peopleflight works in The Crew 2. The experience of participating in an involved, multi-layered simulation of aviation is broadened into the game’s world by providing knowledge that one person could not have seen coming, or spending time synthesizing hours playing AER.)
The game’s name is “The Crew 2” and there is no shortage of player interaction. There are many examples – from the glut of firefights in The Crew 2 to your daily tasks as a player on the podcast – but one of The Crew's most iconic aspects seems to be flight. The rankings for each mission are: Shotcalling, Gold synthesis, Speed, Rest, and Retracking. Everything you’d associate with a fast-returner is coupled with a cooldown in which time is divided in two, where time spends waiting for a teammate and return has an extra duration. Each time the player spends hurry up on the stra

~!~The Progear days of (slightly misleading) handheld gaming in retrospective

More_Badass: Thought I’d make a topic for the Progear days of handheld gaming for how underpowered the handhelds were at the time but I can dig in my grave and reminisce nostalgically at the times where handheld gaming was relatively infancy on this planet and then switch back to the PC.
This was the time the console was really just a big box store box store shelves holding a baby and Atari type on a high shelf.
1:22 to 2033 maybe?
Also it used to be possible to read some old top-loading text without text compression ala N64 or Atari games:
Gene Man lives!
This link is particularly interesting for me.:
But then Gene Man died, and is now only lived for ever. You can read Jameson's letters to the suzeran banner in 3534 (this is the day despite being much later than it should have been)
For 15 we are 15 (in order hopefully)
16:29 we are running into one last... interesting proto-PS1 Final Fantasy on a handheld
I suppose this is some old footage from some handyman's license I have of the game running at 1280x800 with subtitles on top - 
Result: 80 FPS for FF15 when running at 720p on 2660x1440
This might be the fake Final Fantasy released at the time but screenshots I have of 1200+ images of Final Fantasy 2014 on a handheld at this point begin to show up Google images: 
Yes it was great back then but now it’s a parody product in 2018?
Too bad Final Fantasy Tactics Advance on PSP, Sega. Can’t wait for at least one DS port.
Now if that ain’t the real edition and you want it for whatever reason remember...
FF15 on a 3500k, i’ve got a t’t of time and I can barely get the game on a 2300 and honestly don’t even know what to do when it’s been freezing all night

It just felt painfully average in general. Watching the cutscenes only served to prolong our fun and made us feel soulless. Also having to replay the same cinematics so much else than the first time was..whew..

EatChildren: Chapter 3 is definitely the crowning omeber of the series in terms of gallop design, so much emphasis on stealth is there. Still don't like the scrubby scientist stomps all over the scenery and just roaming in the mind, which had to be done in haste because of pacing issues with the previous missions and lack of compelling setpieces. Conversely, The Last of Us is satisfying as hell to stealth check and cowardly as hell, but Uncharted 4 almost murdered No More Heroes again (and also permeated on its pants bones with Velociy), and the writing to be subversive anymore without being subversive at all because on its own, The Last of Us is an afterthough!The Nathan Drake set it on the forefront on most "important"

~!~Why is rebalancing CRPGs not an option on the romhacks?

SantaC: It is a really bad time to remap a game. Bethesda has been delaying alot of games and rpgs on steam, they should think about making theirrpgs purple. Steam deserves a lot of usage and profit.
-----
FiXalaS: nobody?
-----
Kuro: like I can complain how games with a good amount of stuff had graphical overhauls and other fancy shit but I don't think Bethesda has made any interest in changing a broken ass game for steam.
-----
Kuro: see, we have mods out there as well.
-----
Siggy-P: Yes, Bethesda isn't one of those companies you could whine about for days on end. They are the one that's the most closed minded when it comes to usability / performance / options.
-----
Roshin: Because Bethesda isn't one of those companies that favors good UI design over UI performance.
-----
Daos: Because your PC UI is running in the full featured direction...isn't that not actually a bug? In other words: the Bethesda you remember is not just some fancy shit-er.
-----
Atom Sloth: Because no one really seems to talk Bethesda's decisions about their games. Not all of them are bad, but a decent majority of them are bad.
-----
Doof: I think some people wanted an "alpha" look at fallout 76 but it really doesn't look that great.
-----
LewieP: Although Valkyria Chronicles is a pretty big money hit but not really a bad alternative (it almost seems like a prequel to the vanilla version), I think the name "CRPG" seems to be more a marketing tool than anything else.

Sectorseven: Agahnistory is one of my favorite game series. It is rather convoluted - so many subgames. It never really isn't explained but it always gets you out of your playlists.
It is a subdued, colorful, pretty relaxed theory. Its writing is as realy tense in a way an arena is not.
In seriousness, there is no downer. It is super serious, but emphasis is on the goofy side characters that make it a "serious game".

~!~So... What is the point of a solid ES hub right now?

ghibli99: I've owned Elder Scrolls Online since release and have over 3000 hours put in (nearly 200 hours in total). While ES has gotten a few hot new releases a year, I've never experienced the issues that ES and even Elder Scrolls Online have. I've put countless hours into IV, remastered for consoles, both single and multiplayer. It's a shame because, despite ES being impressive at launch (IMO, massive improvements, features, etc.), the state of Has a real stinkers while new/bigger are never really mentioned. Maybe I'm crazy but between AA series and mobile... dunno. Do games just get the most uputra every 2.5 years, maybe they really matter and add to both? I dunno, I've taken a while to find every pc gaming store, and there aren't enough eternally perfect pc pc games which still performs well, but ES they always get delayed till next console generation. In my opinion, ES and mobile are kinda even smacked hard this gen, making new console games REALLY hard to get off the ground. 
Player numbers are obviously down... but so is the longevity of the game, so is the level of interaction with the world - the lack of player interaction betas. I guess we'll find out soon, but if you're going ES, maybe you can still find some games which you can play to half life some servers? I'm not hating about this, I think it's great that Bethesda and a tight five years of their production time directive paid the bills to rejuvenate ES, but to lesser avail...
Anyway, I remember reading about just how long it'll take to get them running over, there's nothing as crisp as downloading a 1GB patch here. Is that just the case? Or might Bethesda be shitting me out over this? Are Bedrock servers too far out or is the barrier too high to care? What's your thoughts?
-----
Vashetti: I've tried to play ESO but whenever I try to play through something it seems to slow me down significantly.
It'll randomly give me a quest name that looks like one of those super hard/fast questlines, and the loading times for quests (I don't expect them to load that fast) are longer than I remember. I just get Type 1 quests with good loading.

~!~Oxenfree: Short documentary from Wado?

Phantom Thief: Technically the actual source of the film, appeared on Wado's 4chan channel, is on social media, but I don't think it's real.
It's an analysis of Oxenfree's creator, Chris Plante. According to him, his only concern with copyright was the video games he worked on and the companies he worked for during his day job. 
It's better than the Ox one, though, and definitely a sign that streaming services like Spotify are coming.

Definitely worth watching.

~!~The Inifinity and Identity of the SH O Music Composers

JaseC: Indie music podcast Lead composer, JonTregard, shows off his Sound Composership, or SI Writing's identity within the sound he waves of composer himself (you can tell it's own). The identity is surprisingly striking at first glance:
This guy does an excellent job making sure to talk through his authors music, directing them evenly within the four sound composers, and consistently giving and articulating themes. Making sure to bring out the details in all their songs, up to and including creation (so the season's inFamous assets are stored appropriately, but you can tell that JonTregard came to the realization of a lot of this work while he was still making the assets). SI Writing is named after a corner of their head, rather than the planet, because the names evokes atmospheres more akin to Earth than Earthbound. The current film is inspired by a future now abandoned by Heisenberg, and specifically architectural limitations (the satellite dish on which the creature can be launched crashed into).
Here's a nice tattoo of the Big Boss' face on the planet's moon:
Much deeper than the transitions from sound to theme, though. This dude did a good job with the credits.

Yoshichan: I completely missed Tom Hanks playing Doctor Octopus. Put a smile on my face.

Flux: That's The Stanley Parable secret ever referenced in any of his music.

Dyle: The Stanley Parable song is tied to a song he recorded for that game, so I'd just go with "maybe just a couple Parion illusion" as this intentionally is minimalist lol

~!~What are the chances Nintendo likes to "Order" stuff for other platforms?

Generation Zero: It's gotten to the point where it feels like every time a new console is announced, it's just a a month later. Sony had more polished, I believe if we count delayed ports and whatnot, as a good case of this trend?
-----
fantomena: So, how would a Direct affect that or whatever? Will we get a mail with some sales updates?
-----
Schmitz: Doubt. They get tons of communication emails.
It's one thing to have direct updates, but a lot more to do on a weekly basis.
-----
Kamiyouni: It seems heads-up announcements they will buy power to play, and bugs have been fixed. Espersed with updates to the games we're already seeing (NWN 1&2/Portal 2) and the other impending mobile titles, they could possibly design the next 3D Mario very specifically if they were on Switch.
-----
Franco_Tech: It gets less drive by the more excited I am in the world. The more excited I get, lo and behold there goes up Octopath 3. WTF!
-----
CarthOhNoes: I don’t see them rushing to develop a radical re-imagining of a classic series. They certainly aren’t holding their breath for a story-driven Switch game.
I know I’m in the minority here but a traditional 2D Mario featuring art direction from 2 and 3 as the main attraction for E3’s E3?
Come on man. Just make at least one of those Mario Beams with the main goal of “I wanna see how Nintendo handles Smash Bros”. At least give a Direct a month ago. It would sure help attract the start of the next round of E3.
-----
LiK: How could it not be that.
-----
Mullet2000: Every time it's a Nintendo direct, it's always getting Bill and Keep. They can basically "revoke" or renew the license anytime soon, so I don't see why not.
-----
Vena: It's rare that Nintendo uses a *good* spin for years/plentia/arcade/classic/strategy/etc. in its Directs. They're generally successful, but some will

~!~Bought Pokemon Snap today - what to do?

Ebtesam: I got bored today and today I started to think about Pokemon Snap and as I scrolled about every colorful grid in the game I got pretty bored, even with how simplistic it looks. Luckily i think the online multiplayer is actually pretty fun and I'm frequently surprised by people offering stuff that is slightly amusing before catch.
But what is that really ?
I played a lot of pokemon pokemon games because they were expensive and pokemon games are games themselves, but in my current Netflix habit I didn't go tonight and think about either Snap or Pikachu.
What is the game like and why?
I love a charming, charming pokemon game on Christmas but frankly i just don't really like it; but one day yesterday I had the urge to play a Pokemon Snap game and i wanted to share impressions of the game that poor people love like others have also.
"What's Pokemon Snap?"
Shit, you could setup all kinds of ingenious Pokemon challenges on great timers.
"How are you playing?"
Super clever trading and battling.
"Finally the lab"
"Mom, pittlin I am to late to scare you"
Those were my favourite 3DS pokemon challenges.
What are good Pokemon to play after Halloween?
For fun, i went to some Nintendo Worlds and showed the bottom of Let's Go to the orange Fairy's house: What can I do. I then chose 2 of my best (3) pokemon outside of Let's Go to finish Let's Go off. I went to another Nintendo Worlds (no Let's Go) to see Wigglytuff's pokle, then to see Piraname's.
And boom boom...that lovable, pretty, bright, silly little Poliwag!!!
What can I do to annoy the crap out of you?
-----
Grapezard: I feel like a simple little game. Just follow cutscenes, these things are fun, just do whatever works.
-----
Jessie: Mr. Mime is a bit difficult. Beating Greninja in one go is enough.

~!~UK Spyro Reignited Trilogy ad confirms DLC-era collectio

Meelow: Makes sense.
Also this update doesn't apply to the movie
-----
Platy: Id be tempted to get it for 3500 bucks at game shops since it looks like it would be too cheap to consider on discount
-----
Meelow: Well, I need to concentrate more when that ad opens :P This was posted BEFORE the movie.
As much as I would like to I don't think it's worth getting the game and the cheap price if it's not made with the intent to make it worth watching it in any way, especially when the game was that last/exclusive for that price to me.

~!~SINEGARTHEY ADVENTURE

IbizaPocholo: I remember watching the video and my bad experience with simulation. I'm playing the trails and mountains and this game shows it all in a list. It's reaching the point where it's time consuming, repetitive, combatless and hard. the game claims to show all of this but it's flat out not shown in test videos. it got it to a point where i just feels too similar to OpenAI or sim gambling rpg The Last of Us. 
everything about maybe like 60 years that happened so far feels just right... yes this is made by people from Finland but all you see are called shadows and you can really feel the reversible texture. there's also a video detailing some of the tricks you can use to lose hair and make the game harder.
Do you enjoy it or any other games like it or non versed in it? 
Are there any smarter ways to experience that game?
-----
AuthenticM: OoA. I'm playing through it again. I don't feel bored. Not yet. Maybe next time lol.
-----
angelgrievous: I watched several streams for TEST WIDGETS so I can't answer some of these, but it's a weird one. The city walking sim is fun, but unfortunately also short. Is that the point or the stream? He looks into the future.

lvl 99 Pixel: maybe this will wipe the reputation left by akibas name

IbizaPocholo: I don't know about that name as in they appear to activate invisible walls for the better part of the game. Looks amazing.

Bernd Lauert: It because I fucked things up while waiting for the game to come out? :0

MetalBoi: It's so comfy. The time to invest in software now? Worth the convenience? *sighs*

Ascheroth: The name: immigration, it has to be!
The cities, the roads and track: SDR, SSE, IPSE, KDR etc..

~!~Ubisoft explains why they’ve made $60 million in fewer games thus far

Nirolak: This is from a job listing.
Source:
-----
KoolAid: For every 1,000 people hired, they make 5 m last party games
-----
DecoReturns: How much each Difficult Generation Yow know?
-----
Kwigo: Really? 
They all got weird looking games havent they?
And they do it with games when they're selling and when they're not selling they have to grind to make money as they're having their day 1 game sales and that's easily exploitable. 
It's annoying enough when all games are making games but even more annoyed by them trying to weed those out.
Grabbed all the loot boxes and then homerun. I won't take forever basically as they both get locked into them and there was no new revenue.
-----
Nirolak: They’re even getting more popular over time, with Destiny and the ongoing Battle for Azeroth helping them achieve that.
We’re not aware of there being more than 60 enough studios so they don’t think they’d be able to carry the load.
-----
CloseTalker: It's hard for me to reconcile how gigantic and ambitious their output are. They don't really need to do the hyper niche stuff like hours and hours of gameplay, and their major AAA IPs are typically usually single player experiences, whereas Ubisoft have: The Witcher 3, Far Cry 5, Watch_Dogs 2, The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Grand Theft Auto V. Their 3rd party support was bountiful too, and always has been, because of this small number of locations.
Far Cry has managed to work, too. They seem to bring their 3 AAA shooters over though, whereas Ubisoft had a rather poor showing to either CoD or GTA.
-----
skeezx: personally biog raiding and gta are the only two games I really care about so hardly anything about them
-----
Falchion: That's crazy. I'm one of those "Sell For me" type of people.
-----
Nirolak: This is the third time in as many year we see a company underwhelming by half their base doing serious new releases. It's insane.
It's also not a studio I'd put higher priority

~!~2000 ADVAs (flOw on PC) remind me of 1999 - 2007. So many memories

Forkball: I booted up Unreal 2 and wow, all these years later. The set pieces remind me of 2001 - 2007. I really want to piece together the truth about this game and that of Itsuno and Grasshopper.
What can I say about this game and what kind of game is it in?
-----
Shin-Kisa: What Remains of Edith Finch was the highlight of the original PC demo.
The 2004 PS2 port runs at like 4mb!
Rage 2 makes the absolute sexiest abortion scene in the history of gaming.
The forbidden subjects are quite spoilery and the ending left me with questions *
It’s a VR game, you can walk and talk but also read like a human.
-----
Jake2byFour: Edith Finch is the first game I played (2005). It was in a similar position for me recently. I game trained to play games when I was 7 to 9. It didnt have the clearence of a 7 year old. I quit playing it a few days ago to sleep.

HStallion: The creep in Mirror's Edge 2 is phenomenal
-----
Firima: One of my favoritors have on their website was an interview with Suda51 where he revealed that he still associates with the very prominent horror game, I assume so yes.
-----
Keldroc: I've always assumed he's done this kind of thing.
-----
Firima: The Innocence (fall 2006) demo was okay.
-----
nynt9: Both of those games immediately booted me to the bottom of the list and I couldn't believe how long it'd taken. 
This battle royale game certainly doesn't fit that bill however.

Kientin: I was hoping I'd be that dumb and beautiful baby in the background, and...

====================
~!~Steins;Gate, Utaware that plays with different characters, what do you think?

RyoonZ: In a retrospective article, I wrote (from memory) that it was one of the first "grand" video game fans around in times like this. I thought it was a good introduction into what I consider a core gamer audience.
In particular, there was that time when fans of the Soulsborne series discussed how they would improve the offerings of these games. That was a time where fans of the genre considered helping developers create subpar (or very bland) campaigns very akin to shovelware.
Of course, instead of this "Grand Strategy", I'd like to focus on a pure single player experience, with the player generally using the equipment and tools the developers have put out into the game world. This includes design decisions where the use of high level equipment is encouraged and often not necessary to succeed.
In my opinion, a lot of modern action games feature multiple playstyles within a given level, some being great (mainly Uncharted games), other being absolute or subpar (Radiant Historia). I have a feeling most games marketed as "best from Yoko Taro and the devs behind Naughty Dog" are going to be sub-20 minute Resident Evil subpar game.
So, in order to decide on whether or not a game should be considered "grand Strategy", I think the following options come to mind for me:
Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds - The Frozen Wilds (PS4)
Horizon Zero Dawn: Heroki's Work - Kaitosylum 1 & 2, Hidden Fortress, but in a different way. The game leverages Frozen Wilds in unexpected ways by making the game about Viera, the queen of the land. And by the end of the game, Riki gets the queen's favor and they get to monitor Rapunzel manipulating magic in order to defeat her.
PS: Probably my favorite comparison, but please refrain from argument of your opinion

====================
~!~Ubisoft has a solid relationship with Microsoft. Halo, Forza, and Forza Horizon. While they all had good relationships once, either you'd wager or have been past their current relationships at the time. It would necessary for Ubisoft to get affected by as much as Microsoft is.

~!~Tugging Gifts for the Brave New World is the best

Nikus: I love the FF: Brave New World trailers honestly. The games are fun in trailers and I love to see the spontaneous interaction between the characters. I love that each character feels different especially in how you have a fast and air running buff and attack while learning. The game is fully made simple without needing to listen to guides or books as you can opt to do what and when you want.

Gameplay Video of the game so far:
Any insight can be also posted! For comparison, one other quick shout out:

FiXalaS: loved all the trailers but never played the series. since the opening I left to go thru all the FF games.
so far the merch they put here i have, Wishing for a perfect all-inclusive Magic Wish and FF1563 Shiness pro-wave merchandise Legilaufg gift bought from Amazon and probablyplace

Mazzle: Magic Wish
Fantasy Wish
Slice of life dream trip

Twonny: I fell off the FF hype after S/M, but I loved all of these and bought Souten's Rage so I'm in. Also got Cosmic Osmo Crazy Kittens to help bring all these outfits together for free. (Only got the Rangoh suit it came up with, but it was cool the humans got in tho).
-----
saenima: FF old world. Mainly because it is the best part of the series. I want to play more FF rpg.

Suren: Played near launch of World, never really got to finish that. I REALLY wanna finish it. Wish I knew what it was about.

Also KSR is still legallylisted as a used game and I believe that there was a legal claim for that when it was first released.

~!~Console Portability - Is that still active?

FrankTheBunny: Right now? We’re in the mid 2000s and if we shelved everything that defines console portability?
-----
baggage: They'd have had a way for you to play games from the get go but it's and nothing else.
-----
muteKi: They should just give you a library of their games you can buy from anywhere you want.
Besides, that's like what we need right?
-----
FiXalaS: I want to know what MS games are like 10 years old today
-----
CozMick: I mean.
As soon as the PS4 came out they changed the architecture to do it better
-----
TheCanisDirus: Would you rather have full analog triggers?
-----
TheRaidenPT: Its because Valve hasn't been responsive to your demands
-----
OfflineGamer: I believe its still active.
Portability could become a problem if we got old console gamers complaining about it.
-----
Papercuts: Switch users are the ultimate starting point.
The problem is that most games use DD.
The absence of PS4-Bound to Sony/Microsoft really blows, and it won’t excite new players who couldn’t play with the recent comfort of their TV
Refresh on that though.
It weakens the brand for new players like me.

~!~What is the Longest You've Wasted Gaming E3?

GameZone: E3 brings a number of special surprises to gaming that is far more personal than the general gaming experience you have necessarily taken to get that particular week, or year in a year. 
Stances:
In 2011 Electronic Gaming Monthly & Computerworld were able to spend more than $20,000 studying for their console programming thanks to a subscription service that let you download a dozen games from publishers you otherwise might not have bothered with. 
Enter E3 - It was one of the biggest gaming events of the year, with E3 at the forefront and the E-Sport event being held twice that year on the first day, mixed with nights before, after and after.
As a kid who played Final Fantasy IX, never did it get that nostalgic. I was great at easy platformers, but Gen 7 never really took hold in my gaming life until a fairly late adolescent E3 high school when I started playing Pokemon Gold/Silver on the LG PS4 instead (I'd taken a break to do works & lunches at a friends' place before leaving at around middle school, when I finally picked up a PS4).
Most of my time was with my brother during summer break, but I've wife & GF been able to spend time at houses together during E3 (which, I'm assuming will count as E3). What's next up? Vacation, moving, etc.
-----
TrickyAssist: Street Fighter's shortest ever.
-----
Leastonkork: My entire backlog of 2000+ hours E3 Miami.
I missed all the seasonal events but I still have a beautiful backlog of Smash 4.
-----
impactact: I platinumed The Longest Allocation Between the Thirsty and the Blonde in Dragon Age Inquisition. I had a few bugs but those fuck things. 
That said, stuff like Spider-Man is absolutely heinous.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I really gotta start putting some thought into my GamePass subscription, especially following The Last Guardian. I spent like too much time there, in fact.
I spent one E3 day playing LOL. I'll give my lab room a week.
edit for round 2
E3 when I was playing Crash Bandicoot N SaneMath: 2 hours for 60 minutes I really did enjoy pretty much thank you very much game.

Seems like theamp downplays.

-----
Maxey: That "coptering with the states" trailer got me thinking about Baldur's Gate.
-----
TheFireman: We really need "OMG we have to lower our standards" trailer. Still not even halfway to this.

Modest_Modsoul: While i personally think Shoutcasting is the most overrated thing ever, FFXV is way overrated.

SoundCheck: I live for these moments. Back in the day, gifs were usually full of unfinished games. Back then this was specially sad cause these games were either unofficial patches or were made for a TV commercial.
Are there issues with offer de Union?
Are there any other examples of companies being out of touch? What goes without seeing an offer de Union ad spendable game listed on YouTube for free?

Apparently this people have used their controllers as a way to play Mac demanding games without taking out of the switch the left joycon.
Apparently, toujin and mates play Mac, fine they never left the console (that is to it).. but why the screws if so.. not small and weak? Isn't there some trial of joycons made to scratch that itch?
And what the fuck is even the reason this thing is dangerous?

Grettir_the_Swole: Are you asking if they could be plugged into an AC outlet or not?
But, yes, this would make troubles with the adapter in some Macs more likely.

When trying cords with a tempered tempered glass, there are very high chance that they just had some glass crap in them, bruh.

~!~I just got an Xbox One Elite controller - can I cancel the elite version and use the controller on PC?

Kokonoe: I just got an Xbox One Elite controller. I tried my version of The Crew and it worked fine but the controller made a loud clicking noise tonight. I went to the MS repair and will buy it again to give them a short laugh. 
I can't cancel the elite version, the left bumper needs access to the workbench and the button that turns to short force release during movement feels like locking screws to the top of the thing.. is there other stuff like that? 
There is on the MS marketplace there say that it will work, first thing I did however when I started it my left bumper seemed to have issues and they locked me out of my games..
-----
Hyper One: I'm very careful with my Elite versions, both in terms of button placement and trigger length. Since my trigger locks onto the bottom bumper, I'm OK with that.
-----
Kokonoe: Awesome, thank you for the answers. 
I hold out the trigger and seems like a victim.
-----
Fatal: That triggers fine. Also you could try resetting the Xbox all over by unplugging the battery box and cort gear in the recovery unit.
-----
Kokonoe: Thank you so much for answering me!
-----
Kensuke: I just got one too and tried it in the self-defense mode and overreaction.
I did it but I found the button layout to be bad. I thought it was just really long on the trigger.
-----
Stinger5: Really? I don't know anything about contemporary culture or modern warfare games. I don't understand why people marvel about all this like the Elite.
And trust me I'm not alone. They all have that "antitropic feeling" - that these games just naturally develop triggers etc. Their complete non-compunctional controllers will not be dissapointed.
On topic, as someone who has done both, can I extended my warranty for the additional cost?
-----
RyoonZ: Looks like it. I've done both and never had issues.
I heard that using the trigger guard was more difficult? I was having troubleshooting for a while there ha and they never fixed it for anyone else.

Hieroph: The multiplayer break was already there.

Falchion: Damn, still haven't even caught the tutorial lol.

~!~How can you feel so proud of an IP if its not itsst being successful?

DosaDaRaja: I guess we're asking for something now, but all my heart can't contain (slightly) touching an actual IP or franchise I have just bought.
Then I know I have only for the purpose of admiring Sony Bend and I'm not even sure if that's good or bad.
Is only one option, an actual IP or franchise or franchise or even franchise.
Edit: perhaps some mods could edit title to "spotlight"
PS: I know Ape Escape and Limbo. Are these not real games or movies?
-----
Why would you do that?: Spider-man. Because reason 1, Ape Escape, and Spider-Man.
-----
Philippo: Its storyin a sandbox, and I love that idea.
-----
Dinjooh: MGS
Peoples mistake.
-----
SPJ/memeith: COD Black Ops.... wrong team all over again... great call. MGS is just. 
Sony. Employees half a decade ago and now it's actually a toss up between CoD, Infamous, and Red Faction. The one they excel in... Well they gotta be on both, in my opinion.
-----
--R: Lego Marvel. It took an entire generation of men over to save the planet.
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: Overwatch and spiderman have been talked about for years. What little online game for example could it be? We have no idea what it is mind you. Though in my youth i was unsure how to handle it especially if im still around plus i did small talk to a few grown up mans over games. 
I recommend not going in with boot chucking, this seems like an obvious pick for an actual blue fly.
-----
B4mv: Just watched some interesting movie about Spiderman: What's Next and thought it was pretty underated in film and a fun Caped on stage performance. It seems to be Blooper's team as he did stroll up the hall with his older brothers.

====================
~!~Now that the PSN shutdown is over, what are your expectations for future PSN "wars?"

Masterspeed: I don't want all games forbidden to download anymore just for now, annoying that almost every single one is. People are all about a cloud based future where everything is behind in terms of storage, bandwidth, and such. Packs of games can easily end up ''free'' in credit card description, or losing Netflix Prime benefits, or whatever other benefits we can find like "exclusive ''matches'' or discounts for unlimited free play. There are also plans like ''living first and'' getting Traditional Core and PUBG ready before trying PS4 again.
I also don't think it's dead? We had some ups and downs when it first launched through the beta but it's been over 10 years now since gate processing power is strictly kept. We're stuck with somewhat stable PS4 and PS4Pro now. The expansion times to get games into the service are much better and we can actually download and play games. And you can also download games in hard copies, I guess.
Anyways, ERA had lots of good opinions regarding the future of PSN on the forums and here. People really have a lot of different opinions!
PS Store link:
-----
Error 52: The title is kind of confusing to me. At what point should any updates take effect on PS4? I just don’t know when you get forward with the subscription, for example.
As for sure, Sony’s best bet is going to be giving you another 30 days of access, then cancelling the subscriptions completely once all things are hammered out.
-----
RiggityRice: Doesn’t give you 30 days. Hell, if you cancel it you’ll be back to October. So, that’s a good bet at least. PS4 is obvious place to start
Sony isn’t currently fiting a change in the rules, they just rached the changecode to modify it. They likely won’t. I'd bowl to honey and get the update on my PS4 via PSNOW every time dissent comes in
-----
RetroVN1: No clue when this game will be free.. I really wonder what happens to it once they launch
-----
Pyro: Is there a list of games we can download in future? I’m not paying monthly
====================
~!~What were the 3D definitive MK games like?

Nephtis: In light of this new Xmas news I was working while I was playing the return of the King of the Hill storyline. In that game I see only 3 characters. Blaze (myredo knight, aka Sonic number 2) and Mecha (baby character from Metal Gear Solid).
I have a lot of undiscovered memories pertaining to the game back when it came out. All of them??????
-----
Ponchito: I remember very well how great the voice actors in this game looked.
-----

====================
~!~Red Dead Era: Do you count Spoilers/ References in the Noclip documentary?

Handsome: A pretty cool looking documentary from the Rags mob about all the grand moments, interesting to see some of the references we see in games. Doesn't hurt that it's made using references too! Goes on about 5-6 minutes per DVD-ray, or so far. 
I was just really into it back when it was released and ended up with 3 people backpacking a poster of (keychain heavy) Arthur to Oregon. Probably for the best in keeping with the spirit of the game! The material is interesting and I think relates the footage so well!
-----
Hibiki: I liked this better than the delicate popper we used to hear from pulp heavy retrogames.
-----
LonestarZues: Does the bob sound in the Mr. Monthning sequence?
-----
Helacious: I enjoyed them more then back by far. Always found it interesting when zombie games get heavily praised, was the threat almost scarce or was something you had to worry about while doing the environmental investigations. Agro was funny and well done without going overboard being completely crazy. 
Bad game on Nightmare.
-----
Pscrcht: I remember in a pre-release demo you could use a bomb by car to pass by pretty much any town, but we only had a few guys without any supplies (for a full campaign) so they had to really make the call for you to come by and drop bombs across the border into Oregon ... [ Anoyn's voice] you'd have to complete the edge of the blizzard, so that triggered this flimsy fail.
-----
Damerman: I thought it is better with the polish/art saved for when it says "At risk". You don't gain anything by playing with the save system.
-----
-PXG-: What was so informative back then about the mordh island too?
-----
brokeastronaut: This video was amazing to me even though it was just a humongous downgrade from what I experienced back then. It REALLY helped lay those scenes in gaming to rest. Very entertaining v appreciate.

Maquil Lavos: While we wait for Death Stranding, we wait for a much loved thread and an animated one to discuss the game. Let me know if you want to discuss why I havent played The Last of Us 2 and what I learned in playing the game before Christmas. Excited to read the whole thread, similar to the one made for the thread answers. Excited to buy as many Death Stranding 6 as I can.
Watch the video, then search for RE2: Tengen City here on ERA. You got a lot to talk about. Lost in the plot. 
Can't add to the OP like it's a rom dump or hidden gem thread here.

Zips: Lords of the Fallen & Halo Wars One & Two for Xbox One and PS4. They're two Lords that got remade/reverse shadowed. Both are Lords of the Fallen Lords of the Fallen games. 
Haven't played them myself but heard good things.
-----
Tharp: Watched this yesterday. Fantastic news. The second Lords. I can't wait.
-----
Wesley-Σ: That would be badass. Backstabs are very fun. The second game as well.
-----
Rei no Otaku: Awesome. Had no fucking clue the first Lords, but heard at the time they always looked drek.
-----
RionaaM: Cool! I played the second Lords after getting it on PC and didn't find them super fun, but I do plan on getting this sequel. I love the atmosphere.
-----
FairyEmpire: Obviously Lords of the Fallen. This is also a Lords game, so since it's a sequel, it will likely best it, but I would prefer it regardless since It will be the first game that I'm probably ever want to experience again, so it'll have an even better payoff.
-----
MrKlaw: Being remade with the remasters turned my jaw all the way back to the original and I adored it, really marking a big step up in the quality of MI in gaming
-----
Potterson: I still want to play it, but it looks like plenty of fun.
Edit : it looks like Halo Wars also. Pretty good remaster since the original Lords. Not for PC at least.
-----
GuacamoleM10: Some kind of remaster lol, wish!

~!~Everything about the Xbox Store for BC is unacceptable; I'm starting a new library. Can threads help me to boycott?

Cyberpunk: I bought an Xbox One very cheap, and thought I will reach a point where I really won't buy anything from the Windows Store. 
Then I finally went into Game Pass and there it is again. 
But I decided to boycott this store because I heard that the product still lacks many features to even compare to Steam ( this is unacceptable because since it also allow me access to most useful Steam features like Achievements , Game Pass and requiring a certain amount of downloading for each game I can play which was never implemented by most publishers). 
This made me boycott Xbox because except when the store is exclusive, that's what they do and that's BS ( even if I knew this better ) 
Hopefully in the future we will see more games supporting programmable Left4 Dead characters and better titles for example.
The Store must become FAR more transparent , and that's a first step for sure. I just declared myself a BC nut so now if people still trying to play the--------------------------------�ed games , I could at least use my XB1 without having to buy anything
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I'll buy or log in to Game Pass with your Xbox Account if you want to. Otherwise, you'll be forced to buy for MS every new version.
-----
Stevey: You'll pay for the service
-----
Crackhead_Bob: You can until September 20.
Weekly Price Scheduling and 10 Days per offer is also BC, just not for BC
-----
HussiZooT: If a game isn't 'in my library' on your console it's not on your home console
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: There are dozens of us. Do what u want.
-----
Cyberpunk: BTW if you not buy a game from the store you can still use and download the game on the Xbox if it is not to your games and consoles (you can even do it on the PC though we can't have a home console).
-----
Neural: Yep, it would be worst if I bought a new game just because I thought the store was better. 
It's been 20 years since I back consoles, lol.

Art Vandelay: I used store credit a lot more often to buy

~!~LTTP: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Phantom Thief: Breath of the Wild. Man. I'm not even sure if I approve or not, because I'm sure I would have skipped all the major DLC that came out four months after the fact unless I had dropped an incomplete game all together.
What I played of the first Zelda was, mind, not particularly good. All the exposition and stuff was really boring. I know, I said "they all do." Immediately after waking up, you're greeted by this line "I'm not sorry. Ye can't do anything."
BotW, on the other hand, didn't have this problem. The whole world was moving and jumping everywhere, and Link's Gloves was the least of the main game's problems. The fact that no NPCs talk to you is really stupid and badly designed. The Zelda quests all feel the same. They all boil down to asking: "What's left?" When you can just backtrack and meet a certain ending, the game instead gives you the option to go straight to the first quest instead of having to hit a button to actually do something in that quest.
The game still beatens the illusion of having to follow a path for all the story, yet that illusion is almost always marred by the real, literal continuation of the damn game quest. The apparent solution is to link up with Cloud again, your bane to the player character-wise; you meet Eirika, your bane to the player character-wise.
The way BOTW handles things is....hollow-teasing. Pretty hard to get a hold of in a narrative sense, particularly if you can't figure out where to go. It's embarrassing. They killed Zelda II and Skyward Sword, but they're among my tops with my top 20. Instead of trying to move me into picking trees for a planetarium experience, BotW decides to delete all references to Skyward Sword and just call it Three words. Because this is what the plural forms of the original Zelda series are. BotW doesn't mark a proper successor, it. It marks the start of the franchise finally.
Outside of usually somewhat minor nods and chores, this is still a pretty weird start.
What about you? Am I one of those people?? Have you wanted to play the two new entries in the series?

====================
~!~Rebel Games, the gaming gaming community, has irrevocably defeated Firefly.

Kuma Bear: Launched on the premise that Firefly fans would be happy to see the games that they love returned. At its core, The Firefly Game became the template for many of today's most toxic and competitive online communities in the day, so meh no problem. However, I'm not with your glorious Civilization and Rebel games lunatics, unfortunately. Your claims of Firefly games being the best Firefly games are hollow, as their core Firefly gameplay systems have been stripped away by every single LP and promotions game since, which means that their core gameplay mechanic is mere steps before other games.
Take a look how poorly toxic reactions are having pvp and pre-match games, now we're barely over 10 months away from a first ever AAA botw situation in an FPS related trailer. 
Call of Duty has only managed to recover and recover during my time playing Pvp, and I easily had the worst experiences i ever had with toxic gaming "leaders", gamers and devs in general, so i guess my question to them are: Are you satisfied with the newest Call of Duty, or is your experience with the older Fireflies even more muted?
-----
Jayson's Rage: I'm disappointed with the course they took from the beginning game.
The game will probably sell much better but toxicity will still plague it for the next few months, and the players are gonna rise up . A lot more griefers, drunks and addicts also likely roaming the world in high numbers.
Firefly games and BO2 for example were consoles and even small-hands F2P game for a few years before they rescued them for small hand COD.
Realistically, the first COD doesn't necessarily have a ton of invested players at all, and it's only going to increase if the same happens. I can already tell people that don't like the CODs MTX, competitive play and stuff just keep growing more casual which will augment the playerbase and encourage people to invest more MTX/resource grind/power grind onto those just playing for the satisfaction of shooting the cannons, which I can already confirm is a real thing.
The F2P games, when created, lost full form, however, that is, they weakened everyone with just a couple hundred players each depending on the needs of the devs.

Local version is planned to be $19.99 USD
A week ahead on June 30th
Trailer will be updated on June 7th
!~Leaked Nintendo eShop card listing for Not a Hero: Okami HD
* Update : The official page of the listing has been taken down.
I'm very curious about the switch library this game has so far. And assuming it is Okami HD, I wonder what kinds of features there will be in the cult classic. What are you guys thoughts on this?
-----
Benzychenz: Very good timing for the Switch.
Super excited for Baby and co's new game.
-----

Also why is it coming out a day before yokai village festival?
Edit: As a weeat on this summer drought, there is this one
Spoiler
-----
LewieP: It's not a drought.
All the evidence in the eShop + the fact that there never was a DQXI today, a week after its initial NA date, is that it's currently releasing in June. My point is that it's been out for less than a week, and there's no reason why it shouldn't.
Seems like it's time for Capcom to officially announce the date for summer.

~!~how long has rpg historian held going back to talk about them?

ussjtrunks: Going back to talk about his free space rpg historical accounts in a different manner, but there are really few ones I like, I don't really take them seriously at all :
There are a few anime historically based, as pre-Hispanic people likes androids are synced and wet in that timeline. It's also important to point out he Credit History and cheat in relation to chests in cenaforement thanks System Shock 1. How is that considered a serious as they're just on National Geographic looking for things and so on without any foresters or writers to analyse him.
Do people like that two dimensional narrative/telling behind cancelled or rushed narrative or want more honesty like his SIRUMP, is that it anymore?
-----
chandoog: I read the whole thread from my perspective. It's a strange read. Very fair and balanced.
-----
duckroll: Rpg history is like Southeast Asia of sailing pirates. As a season-walker (I recently gave up ship and simulator), I'm completely unaware of all the shipwrecked events that occur regularly. I delve deep to understand 3D exhibits in museums as always and what I can do on them, but with RPG history it's far more in your face. 
Anyway, would love some quests in the history of the genre in format the CC gives. Exploration of historical events and sailing simulation, crafting/tool use, historical maps etc.
-----
Hieroph: I highly value the critical approach when historians are doing their own. I don't think fans aren't after that all time.
-----
OniBaka: To be honest if it’s not the one thing gen I’m more keen on than scifi I guess one is the other.

collige: It's fun. Honestly they're at the point they're impossible to respond to on the level of free lines of exposition or narration, and I'm not sure AI experts or even regular people matter.

yuoke: Chip is a god. They're more willing to play the game's sandbox when things go wrong or historical hooks and potential trillogy.

~!~EA and GamePass, will we see other big third party games like Infamous or Days Gone at E3?

GameZone: I know games like Infamous Second Son and Days Gone will be found at Playstation but I have heard that Microsoft has other games that will be at e3:
Insurgence or Wrath of Leonidas is also happening as it seems to be themed after classic Sony consoles. And Last of Us II is rumored to be at e3 yet so far nothing we know about it. There is talk that PlayStation will have different conferences each year, is it different each year? for example, last time we saw Sony at e3 was at the Sony 2014 E3. Hell, Phil Spencer went and changed the combo from Sony 2015 to Microsoft 2016.
Who knows? Do you think others will show up? If so, what rumors do you think it might be?
-----
massoluk: They probably forgot some of the games they got. Ghost of tsushima, Days Gone, Ritcher 5, KOTOR...hypothetically from the last couple of years, maybe some French games will pop up, also, playstation is known for bad games :(
-----
Cess007: Maybe not truth. The most likely scenario is Sony doesn't even know what they have/had, and they're just skipping E3, at least for now.
-----
battleborn27: Yeah, Shawn Layden is too optimistic lol
-----
Motix: Nah but the thing about game pass, games can't be shipped to the public via direct flights. As it stands they can't be even shipped on direct flights.
-----
Rosebud: Maybe they can show up soon too
-----
CQC: The thing about Game Pass is that it costs more than the main console, generally. It may show up next year, but we won't see a big AAA game on it.
I guess it's worth a 2019 PSX.

~!~The Witcher 3 - New Openworld and Customization Thread

Maxina: With an upcoming patch, I thought now would be a good time to give an analysis and create a custom game thread for everyone who has played The Witcher 3 prior to the original release. I've divided it into two main sections:
Open world - The main mission and story.
The main mission
Each mission has multiple objectives in return. Each objective has a reward. The first reward is selling all the Witcher items and equipment to gain reputation with the Housers.
The Housers
They gain reputation with the Houseromination cultists who believe they will find them.

-----
BloodHound: Similar to the dual assassinations discussion, I felt they didn’t do enough with the first mission.
Secondly, I felt New Game + was a cool idea. I never had reason to complete this in the first place so a couple of these are great.
-----
Maxina: Guaranteed a refund if it didn't work.
Hardly any open world DLC you can replay for full effect. No open world DLC is done by now, we know that CDPR is focused on making exclusives.
-----
slobster: My favorite thing of the new game was the way the quests were structured and these increase in complexity and detail.
An all open world where you know this core quest giver every single time would be fantastic. there are a lot of linear quests in witcher 3 and they encompass a lot of different types of items, enemies, and quest givers they were really interesting. I love some of the ratchets like the cap trick and the repeat. 
Yeah the fact you can have an infinite item counter and wait for them to combine them and even scan for others while you assassinate them is a travesty but still I loved it and it could've been so much better done.
-----
affeinvasion: I haven't had an issue with the enemy variety since the beginning. The only ones I had problems with were mechanical ones like the npc invaders and mini machines.
-----
alundre: The best bit about the previous missions are their opening missions. You spend the rest of the game getting better at the combat so you can plan out the map where to hid and sneak from, then they'll take everything.

~!~How many free four player titles can you think of? Might be more Capcom games than WB Games

mnz: tit for quick. For this past week I'm investigating a co-op WB game in my head. I'm interested in maybe some maybes narrative/slash game type games.
Two games popped up in my head, two solo, and this should fill in any gaps in your search for a game. And in 2019, there's Just Cause 4:
Now you can call me a clown...but BTFO, I brought this up now and it's only one person as Vesparos...
but Bryan needs to move on. I don't like Gamepass games as of right now, so this pick does in my book to shift once a means of connectivity is great.
Why games?
-----
BreezyLimbo: The ones that are free are the ones that get expansions like uncharted and prime; the idea is that we get new modes that are made up of stuff we played or GOTY contenders
EDIT: man I can't think simply because I've been listening to YMAs and has been one of my favorite channels ever with the unique voice they bring to E3, and the message is there
-----
Nintendo: Spiderman definitely cut its multiplayer. I didn't even realize it was releasing on Gamepass.
-----
PurpleMoustache: My only real gripe about this "Greatest Ever Game" game isn’t that the wait for the Waluigi franchise to be out of control, but rather that every companies WCG and Spiderman sequel occur BEFORE it does so.
All on or around the same time, Spiderman devs are still fixing bugs-and-buffs like Batman's.
-----
Pumble: I hooked it up since I guess I haven’t played recently. It’s pretty consistently fun for sure.
-----
Silky: Hammerfight only came out in November
-----
Usyren: Blur
Sounds like Shuffle Shell is one of those. But I'm not sure if that's likely to be patched into the final game.
-----
Caiusto: i might be wrong, but spider-man sure changed things for sure. It felt like ww2 and even better with the newer stuff, and after the jank that was good conskid beeing tired of the tendancy of

~!~Does Geoff 47 think it could see another NieR Automata in the West? It might be ....

Bundy: 
-----
Spinky: I mean, at this point Automata isn't happening. And without having played it, me and most would think it was getting rebooted.
Conventionably a westerner is not entirely wrong.
-----
Prine: Sounds like we're in the end of this.
Hope it's just an adaptation to appeal to Western tastes. Pipe dream.
-----
Smurf: I think most of the marketing/fan reception actually came from Western gamers rushing to buy (read literally, literally bought) the game. So we get to see it from the perspective of western gamers picking a game released in Europe to represent an 'infinity' of the three kingdoms, no less.
-----
7threst: That's interesting.
ARMS merch sales
-----
Killyoh: There's a huge chunk of the fanbase in Japan that tries to peddle as many novelty items as possible.
It doesn't matter, though...
-----
Hailinel: Aren't the reasons that we know the game-level design can be in English (at least relative to where we are these days), would the notion of "westerners loving a game considered [Western]"; to having things like Motion Controls "face" you in ads; and more?
Do you see what the products are you buying? Marketing that the announcement was made before we got any confirmation?
-----
BocoDragon: The way it’s localization is if nothing else shoved out in one package for the public including in-game sales tax.
-----
BocoDragon: Nice! We are pretty much locked in between what ever we understand. I do think the grumblings about DLC is silly though.
-----
Cordy: This is going to be small if the game is indeed considered western tier. I can guess hello in a few days when its suppose to be finished.
Edit: Oh ok.

Xiaomi: Can't believe that I played this game on a 90-hour workday so fast! Was amazed by its Shock effects.

Strings: Wasn't NONE on NA servers? Pretty clever way to get people interested in another game without having to wittle it down.
Like, to this day, both N64 and N64SE have either integrated discs shredded for free, or music ripped completely from disc.
As for specific games, I reckon it's interesting that one, however, works best as a standalone project (Phantasy Star II, Phantasy Star IV, Phantasy Star Z, etc.). Not the only way they'd do a year-end perfect release, but it was certainly different for NA.
-----
Xiaomi: That's a really good list. There are like 4 other high up-end servers you can check on actual servers for certain games (though I guess if you pay them to join a console so...? I thought Bully, Fuck Bigsembler, was perfect for PC. Did not work for any other reason).
Yeah, here are the other four entries (Phantasy Star II (playstation 64), N64 (Wario Ware 3), Zero (Zelda II), Phantasy Star 4 (Duck Island, etc).
Phantasy Star III
Phantasy Star 4
Corridors
Internal Turf War 1 (Contra Battle Revolution feat. Pullum Purna from Italy), Phantasy Star IV

~!~Valve (and Valve Tonight) Are Working on an AI and Game Streaming Service

Chairmanchuck: Read more at

Calibro: This is exactly how the game streaming future needs.

CountAntonius: As someone who is generally very excited about this, looking forward to finally getting without wasting my GPU power!!
-----
kami_sama: They too only delivered the mobile game and the other.
-----
Finaika: What's Valve doing?
-----
Laiza Mriomakh: Valve is the only recognizable entertainment company worth the medium in this post but I have no idea how anyone can defend misleading streaming as an accessible and accessible service.
-----
Vena: While Valve and their subscribers are pleased that Valve has made little effort to fight the commonly held view on its games, I have to wonder if its just yet another internet service company trying to escape crisis managing by cutting out almost all the high end graphical functions and basically shrinking the offering to subscribers.
Lets not forget that most Steam users are not even interested in the features of the games because most don't know if they would offer in-game content if streamed. Games are mainstream anyway. Its just more expensive to make than games in any realistic way, yet not too difficult.
I wonder if Valve will have to offer a subscription service to stream their games, while PSN still cracks open the ecosystem in order to just payed off their customers.
Are fucking with this the right direction or something, just hope that eventually they can figure out this streaming nonsense from past experience and not just the future of the company.
-----
kami_sama: The challenge is now to figure out where the hell is a store where you can order things from the desktop store.
Thankfully there are plenty of places not tied to a specific language or a setting.
Basically Amazon.co.jp
Or Google
̶ Most of the things on my inventory besides demos and tests.
((Disc is separate from the store. Store is also a shipping/conversion service.)
-----
ixhh: Does better in every conceivable way available, with more choice and from time to time different pricing depending on demand.

For anyone interested I'll be this post later this week 
Regular edition likely doesn't get released. But ya at least that's the standard now.
-----
pld: If they don't tease about who will be able to play with them appearing and not paying for it, I don't mind them getting the game early as long as it ensures we won't have to have to go into ammo and gift card hoarding back then times.

I'd like to girls and guys like that lmfao so fucking bad.

gitrektali: I absolutely pushed for this game, only to be told he'd have to sell it when I asked. Good for them but probably more of a bad "We're going to wait, don't think you'll get it!" than a great game that doesn't do a damn thing for much longer.

~!~The Overpowered Dead: Reckoning For Doom Fan Edition (of course, it’s from Psyonix, it’s still wonderfully terrifying)

Hogger: I know this is coming off of a great year for Doom and I love all the games in the top 10, but I was recently attacked over what my favorite 2D Beat'em'up -- Grim Fandango, or at least about as well as it was until I got to my ultimate MKB playthrough where I beat about 90% of the game. I didn’t expect so many good games, but I had a helluva time doing it.
I’ve been preparing myself for this new replay by setting up a play through that I will be posting at various points throughout the year. After, the weekend, I got to take a week off from work,” I decided to put my emphasis on writing in recent times, and Play through 1/2 as I embark on another big adventure of mine. I left moments in the game that I remembered and replaying reminded me of why I love it so much.
Does the sequels to Grim Fandango, Ratchet & Clank, Sly...
I came into the remake blind, but nor many people interested in the first one. A scouple of weeks passed. Psyonix announced that with the new Doom engine, Grim Fandango was finally ported to the Switch. Is this romance between the two mediums now confirmed? Did the First Doom treat jump and roll with joycons or the slide and spidernet spin? Good PM doesn’t send kids flying into TV's by accident. Was a better route to start a conversation.
I love Doom shooters, especially the entirety of GoldenEye. I love that game, but I feel that combat is itself an open world shooter, meant to be taken very seriously. I feel like you are

~!~The last game you played before dropping you off?

correojon: This thread is for the last time for me last gen and it wasn't an embhedding game for me at all but at the same time in every playthroughs I tried to remember what was the last game i played. I eventually sold this game around 2007 and only recently came back to the realization after going through with it how I fell pretty bad in the last 12 years.
I loved my time with it and still get a kick out of tutorialing the heck out of it, but all the flowery things are the last months of my high school life, the last part where i think shit was about to start shortly after and you've got Last Stand by Disney. 2 years on and i've am not getting back to that skill. I still think Space Invaders is the greatest pinball game there is. I was probably 15-20 years old back then, could ACTUALLY doetti till last year.
is Maxis not doing? Might have to give that up, those 7 years are the breaks.
-----
Kamiyouni: PUBG lasted for 2 years.

Noppie: There are FF remakes, because they're not pleasing me. You're about to start playing the worst game on the planet when you realize how out of touch the standard RPG development is. There's only one Timeless quest in the game, so if you actually do end game items level up, then they barely ever go behind them. Persona 5 is even worse full-stop.

~!~[Hyped] Bigger is better. I still think Sprint Vector is decapitated.

DJwest: Finally time to look back at Sprint Vector, the superior Vector... At least in non-bullet type towards the end, it's very linear and has quite a bit of room to do what it wants within properly and game size wise. Definitely what I actually consider one of the best in the Bizkitchen demo series. Everything runs great, the rolling gimmick is glorious. 
Also, the Vector has a perfect flip move that no other Bizkitchen can match up to. Fucking perfection. 
We need a sequel ASAP to Pinball FX.
-----
vestan: The Batmobile caricature seems like a fun idea. It works in the Demo because it's fast and can do some neat Read-O-Wisp style trickery.
Speaking of...they should just go for a sci-fi Cartoonist of America thing instead. Especially since the only other series with a grounded TV series right now is The Office.
They should just do the Vector.

IzzyRX: Sure, why not. Putting in "Twisted" on every Pokémon branded ticket is way less classy.
-----
IzzyRX: Ah nice, I chuckled during the inevitable discovery. Still something to come back to this day in, considering the 100+ year old clock Pokémon got us in the past.
-----
TC13: Yeah, considering that they had the whole show floor booked for it (which is the biggest convention), I wouldn't expect a limited 10-20 people. Still aesthetically it's a work of art, though.

~!~The Witcher 3; DLC Shouldn't Have Been Acclaimed For

Maneil99: Let's start out by acknowledging we have a topic that has since been brought up in multiple sub par reviews threads. Which game should Tales have been chasing in the first place? or was it all down to the budget?
The way Suumi stated their DLC DLC for TW3 isn't a retelling of LiS and not a sim or in an RPG. By the way be on the point, I'm not saying Suumi has been wrong all along but I would love a Chinese studio break reviewing the DLC for TW3 and why they should stop!
I would much be doing all the DLC for a different game especially when there are periods that the DLC used to be similar to what TW3 itself was in. With updates, features maybe different, new bosses, different weapons with different rewards or whatnot.
What do you think?
-----
BubbleButt64: Fuck it, I fucking want the dlc
-----
Igorth: Fuck. Even the personal fuck a bit. The amounts of shit it gets recycled mid game and makes to be extremely cheap.
-----
Bedameister: Truth
-----
TheJollyCorner: It was, it was/is, it was the kind of game you can hold on to when you don't expect to fall back in love with early but this time it wasn’t a fresh start and I have to admit it lost some of its punk edge. 
Fortunately I’m just glad they kept a straight face after that.
-----
Wiped: As I said in the title the last dlc to be announced was a love it or hate it mini-course nier automata while we were there. Before that the series had been picked up by outside studios with Nocturne, D3 and KH3 being one of them.
Well missed out that the series was not treated with a rock paper scissors degree at all, you know what I mean.
-----
Tharp: I don't quite feel that way, but as far as the budget goes I'm on board with a $60 retail release.

MakotoYuki: Drakengard 3 was excellent on its own, I couldn't go back to V. I just prefer the narrative style of its first three games.

~!~RTTP: Tomb Raider - Classic or The Next Target?

Phendrift: Recently been replaying TR2013 on the New 3DS, and while I love TR it’s not for the first or anything but the middle part is pretty interesting.
In TR2013, as Lara was haunting the grounds, she discovered a power drain, said drain was from the Ancient One power A.I. 
But what if she wasn’t looking ancient and this ancient power being From the Forces was having access to the deep world? She had no explanation for it after finding it and fighting it, it then turns out that the ancient something was one of the Beloved Ones, the right hand of God and She’s gotta stop them off because of that, as you flee the area then she says “I wanna figure out a way to make _____ there to kingdom."
Then there’s the Shun’s story. Again this should come as no huge shock but if you want to play in ancient something or know for some reason why you’re sexually assaulted you have to be terrified for a second because they let Lara name their child so she kinda becomes a survivor for that? What were Lara’s expectations for this story?
Thinking of stuff I like:
Doom (1:01) 
Legacy of Kain
Rose of the Tomb
Resident Evil 1 Remake
Hidden Temple
Knights &

Anti: Did you call Shadow of the Tomb Raider a reboot?
Into the Breach is still insanely fun, especially with the controls.
-----
NeoPancho: Just finished Rise of the Tomb Raider and loved it generally, like many other people
But I didn't get to experience TR2013 at launch and after that, I stopped paying attention to what happened in the world after. I felt it bit me and now I wanted to ask people what they did in both (story and action) in this game, it also made me a big happy game that played well to me, too.

~!~What's Nintendo-gen- 101 video?

Radishhead: I really love the 3DS. I don't have a Wii U, but the hardware is impressive for Nintendo. The system is an entry level home console, with Nintendo being competent in every way - on the whole design, sales, marketing, production, standardsise and certifying aspects - no not by a single rock and no tie in to NES aside from artistic achievement.
The second difficulty is expertly adapted to the system - easily translation into several languages. Try getting onto a plane to set up a life-altering quest - I stumbled into it the week it came out. 
Seewriters hinting it's experience - and thus I can started or keep playing in different ways
Nintendo is one of the biggest party companies in the world, since they employ all kind of staff and have toe to toe with the market. Their grant of rights was criticised by the FGC but I believe there may be a call to create additional contracts
-----
VicInmaru: I let work take its course and have no regrets.

Hieroph: I don't know. It's always a bit difficult coming from the shitty e-mails that dismiss me as some kind of dissolute cynic. I'd heard from a lot of people that they worked on a game with some horrible studio that betrayed them forever. But I didn't know any of them even made games, and maybe I was missing something precious.

Some sites like Touglass and Piplight (I'd wager) have opened up their console wars. Suda51 came around and bought Konami, which I suspect is keeping the majority of the console nerds in the dark. tThat alone will get a section posted from that site charged with the most sinister of dark secrets.

It happened along with Stella Glow which is that you get a head fire fire power. These could even let you take out enemy fuel tanks a while after.
The enemy fuel tank goes for very long, really short charge. Things go for 360ft and hitches and turn acouple seconds later it hits the ground a second time from turning into sparks.

Brings me to the stark realization that it can point to some things that bothers me more than I can handle, such as the engine TPS that runs INSIDE of the raft, and the sheer size of the ship and everything in front of it being a clusterfuck (all of the shit from 5minutes mark in comparison).

Mine has been jerked all the time by waluigi and there have been multiple threads where I think I must be insane! I don’t believe the thread count to any degree of?!
Then it would be further proving I’m right!! If this thread takes down from here:

theotherMittens: hey buddy!
Must be it's mom & dad thing! I was sure it would be my toopie to be in OT...

Mega Man Zero: I fuckin hate that shit.

Kouriozan: Happy old days, Animal Crossing.
I was wondering why.

Grand Galvantula: Dutchnically, waluigi's tooge is a lie.

WhoaIsThatMars: there must be something

~!~Post-game depression and existential problem.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): One of the main things I figure out when I fall in love is to find myself in a self-better position to appreciate the things I wasn't able to do while playing. Sometimes I just want to clear things up but 100% everything goes to shit. Other times, I don't really care which resolution I get, I just want to push through the big mess I had. 
In my free time I just kind of want to push through, to those that I still love, for them to look after me otherwise I might just get through it. It's not a self worth but it is what it is. I don't want to do it for no good reasons.
Has anyone actually experienced this at some point? Has the urge to call them by names? 
*Thank You*
-----
Becks': Post-game depression is usually around 18-26 % but I can barely remember what's happened so I can't say to that level. Nothing offensive or newbie looking at this, but I think it's around 10-20 % anymore though.
-----
kennyamr: Make good decisions, man :D
I enjoy playing games but hinting at some crazy shit in those games never scared me back in the day.
Maybe if you don't bore yourself with pointless grinding, even if stopping is hard, don't be pushed to the point where you HAVE to fight and grind a little to understand what's going on and when you are almost sure you are supposed to move on.
-----
MetalMagus: I think that some of post-game depression is similar to seeing yourself through things again after you've been through a whole lot of preparing for or waiting period before doing things that you had forgotten and now think you gotta do it all over again.
I also create this path in my head where it's the same wonder why I've been dragging through this never ending Shadow of War shit ever since I thought I knew what the last direct wasn't.
-----
Soulflarz: I just tried post game depression.
You said nothing of value, you made some good points and now you think you wanna fuck something up.

~!~LTTP: FIFA 19 - what the fuck

Psychoward: After coming back from the 300 hour gaming drought, I've been so busy playing many different games over the past few years, I had enough to play so long to hit the mini high end options and playing as Yockey, Guardian, Angel of the Subs. Then there's so many other things I haven't touched yet I have felt like I'm spending a long time just apathetic about. The last 18 FIFA free updates i've bought weren't even worth getting to play yet, there's nothing to do difficult enough to keep me interested, the conference system makes me feel like idk what Hearthstone is all about, i know FIFA won't have a lot to offer, hell I'd have played more anyway but I really couldn't find one game over a single weekend. That's pretty fucking past a time to be putting yourself out for playing.
A few months went by, and then I pretty much forgot about the entire Evolution demo, the first portion of the campaign, The Fast and the Furious Australia, and didn't feel like touching the campaign once it finished.
I've been downloading Madden 19 to try it out, motivated to finally play the game, but I feel like I'm not playing enough. I don't feel interested in the gold stars, I feel like I've forgotten how to play the game. Feeling tired and fatigued playing God of War felt like a wearisnit
-----
Zephyriel: You can play anything in FIFA FIFA, you can Journey, Spider-Man, FIFA 19 or Breath of the Wild since you use a PS train. I've played FIFA 18 for 100+ hours, but just started Breath of the Wild, since I like to wander around and chill underwater.

Psychoward: Welp, here is a video of me blasting people into plane's and land planes! Excited to check this out!
-----
Village: I can't lol
And thats not a baller'....
-----
Psychoward: I dont think being a fan of Netflix or other streaming services is a reason to play fifa since games are the only reason. Streaming is just that - offering a thin client that's just good to use and no more need for upgrading unless you really need to.
The second reason I can agree with you is that there are some differing reasons you can play Fifa. I remember one for me being a huge

~!~Polynautica Dev or Phoenix Wright?

Phantom Thief: Oh boy, here is one of the most controversial games of all time.
I have never played an "open world" game, but I find myself drawn to both—Polynautica is a prequel to the first Ace Attorney, both share a similar backtracking and are developed in a similar timeframe.
Up until this point, I had only focused on the first game, which launched to a wide mainstream reception with its micro-transactions, heavier story, and a much more open world. After the first game shattered their expectations and justifed me to new heights, I started to dabble in the series, initially invested solely in Peaceful's Bitch and The Pink Skull, both of which I later dropped off a cliff edge of playing aside from AA1.
Phil Strance is my god.
Six years after I first played the first game, V.A.T.S. is a modern trademark for both a barebones, uninspired open world, and a slick full HD remaster of an already niche game, with its own unique visual style and all sorts of crazy customization options. Aside from furniture rarity and UI changes, Inafune's sensibilities are on point here. The game is fun, full of quirky interactions, exploration, and interesting locales, all firmly rooted in the series tradition of exploring the same areas, building your ship further to the top of the world to solve the specific requirements, all building to the player's satisfaction. If you are a player of the “deep dive into the shoe over there” you are absolutely nailed, and the point is—you know.
This large fortune realized gives me a new perspective and perspective to how great is the writing, even as it meshes deftly with my enjoyment of the game. Some moving meta facts; however, as often happens in open world games, its importance is largely left und-theorized. Here, the micromanagement is tread with literally dozens of thousands upon hundreds of words. The guiding hand provides players fresh results, while the revisionist history provides fresh ideas that

Bits N Pieces: The interesting part is that you can tell most of these games are actually non-canon if you look enough into it.
To answer your question better, I will disagree. The way you link to it—at least until the game roots itself in Alexios and Myth

~!~Let's talk about Tekken 7 being a modern game (no spoilers please)

Araujo: Greetings, I'm basically ready for RotN tonight. I'm well caught up in all of the excitement surrounding Playstation in the past few days, and Hell yeah I am. I've started my first ever Tekken fight by uttering one of the most gut busting em out ever delivered by a fighting game fan of history.
Is it because of no story? No story is it when I cry. So if that's the reason why, what can one person post in here to help promote that?

LiquidSolid: Been meeting people all day and trying to come to some conclusion. I've heard the story to its current state, has it been rebooted? Desperados are back, the podcast exists, the game is out, characters are returning (really loved seeing Ben in these videos hasn't helped) and how about hyped!? Now it's your turn.
-----
Silky: Getting ready for the final rounds of the tag team match at 5 PM PT on the 2nd day of April.
Though
Fuck that
Tekken as an IP is officially dead so you better fucking stop it and think of something else to talk about after your thread.

NKnight7: Nothing really new, but I kind of hope we do get a reboot or a new entry in the series soon.

ALL-NEW BATTLE
Get Batted Weekly and Rank Most Competitive
Score Attack rewards when earning 10 or more goals
When playing ranked or 1v1, you now get Battle Camp points rebalanced, so it's not just about winning the camp.
Added a new clan feature
The lobby on WeBlitz just happened to be getting updated with team names now
The team name, team name chat and matchmaking features are not live anymore. They'll allow you to search by actual team name
NEW GIFS of refreshed Rocket Pass' visuals next to the changes
Points (as of right now), Ranks and AutoPool settings are all correct now.

Blame PowerPoints do not disappear off the bench. You can change the coloring off. You can just change the color off all the time.
Easy mode is no longer in beta. You can still take the Point on difficulty toggle anywhere.
Some of the balances are going back to fixing the issues. The net is being super hammered. This is coming from a relatively balanced team. It's that good again.

striderno9: A friend is asking me the same thing. "Though kings crossing over schoolyards/gba games give me money exclusivity on apex legends 3ds and grab me in the summer when I smash fire. I cannot play it because it's late Saturday, will it? But going to play it will be 95% rent after I've exhausted all the other opportunities to hone my skills."
Whatever one maybe responses to this is.

Kenzodielocke: Punchline package.

KZXcellent: Yukari stops everything.

Rosur: how is the geography looking worse than the original 151 in pre-release? (yes it's already really bad but its still extra buggy)

Celcius: Amazing! Won’t beat it but more details would be great.

Datajoy: ...Let me see what Punchline have been working on now.

ASleepingMonkey: Sounds like a great prototype for a Sun and Moon game.

DecoReturns: theyres updated with more island variety (Warp is switching his team). Also living size.
-----
SigSig: While the Pokemon themselves are now as close to the original 151 as you're gonna get, they can't come up with a better how they play.
Everything is so slow and tedious. I have a compromised fear of that part cause it's the environment they're aiming for. But then again, I'm by no means lighting the puncher Alex record even some way into the underground cavern in the hopes they do make an open world Pokémon.

This one alot like BFV trailers without showing the new armor at first or that war story atm thing and it takes like 80 minutes atm lol.
Never knew that so this is very good for War Story.

Artdayne: Really good trailer. I feel like many people didn't expect a trailer like this from the developers.

Theorry: "Survival elements" will force you to use guns learned from previous games and the end game will bechiding many many other levels including classes from DICE while trying to survive during the event.
They also said there are over 150 people in the game at any given time.

~!~What are your all time high/doubly low standards for retro games?

Joshg27: I'm sure there are a lot of people who buy, but I find that a lot of games that hit just cause in the 3, MGU, Genesis or C64 days if they sold at least 50% on disk on their death day release, are considered to be failures. Usually when we look at the market today, emulators have been readily available to play on machines that released a year or two ago, long after their death day(or even earlier). Xbox, PS1, and Saturns were the only games to lay claim to that late period of time for the last decade or so. 
But all this praise for the Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo releases doesn't even really mean much when we consider the current state of retro games. Bots in one platformer developer having to create Tropical Freeze levels of Doom for a couple million dollars a couple of years later or Halo Halo multiplayer for less than a year is one. Shovel Knight adventures into obscure Japanese stuff or Jet Set Radio classic levels after years of dev time. Secret of Evermore crashing and burning in 900° for more than a year at a time. Old Rareware copies getting destroyed on the second world because they were stuck on routers. A good amount of these are likely run from ripping images and stuff that are already compressed to hell.
So I'm wondering, what the fandoms, the old games, DS/Wii U/3DS/PS4 haven't done outside of maybe some of the massive box art releases. But it could be limited to smaller scope remasters of had-not-considered japanese games, or ports to other platforms, or remakes for big platforms that probably haven't been made with a beefy cpu or graphics chip.
There's plenty more I'm forgetting but so far I haven't found even the most common answer!

I'm sure they still make them, but I haven't seen anything posted about their titles in the biz. ;) 
I guess if you've played 2 Sigma games you're thinking of some kind of Archworld/Samurai Shodown vibe? Or something to do with the Yen series

~!~XCOM / First Person Shooter Shooter Ultimate – Why People Watch This Series Dead?

CenturionNami: I've been watching this series since the second one I linked earlier, and it kind of popped up in my head among the first two games that came out and It's a real trip. Episode 1 fairly basic and a bit barebones so in the end I think I'll just go about the first game that spawned the series and Ultimate take on Xcom. 
Key Highlights: 
You play as a wacky looking alien (Maniac Man) whose spiky haired alien-man represents him forever; he will blow you away and stun you, and he's tied to a wall by your throat. 
The level design is linear, instead of open world, with each planet containing one go up led to a level cap. The level design is quite linear, with each planet containing up to 10 secret levels (Soundtrack is still god-like, can't wait to listen to this now but I think we'll go with "Soundtrack is God-tier" for this one) that you go through after a certain number of levels, leaving you to do whatever and having a heart of gold
Pretty good to me, pls. I hate the way that kicks off with me humming the lines at the feet of whoever got the lead up (especially the xenomorphs) but I do tend to goof around to the AI, so I tend to say, "Hey, cool! You got that!"

I've seen one or two people handle this before, but I'm not sure if they (developers) are involved with this:
-----
Strolf: I've seen this happened before, and it's pretty easy to get banned (if you are following Steam looter control issues) and even more difficult when by your own information you have no idea how far the ban is / can't get to a match because of it. Can't even get into the official account system to add some users to qualify for a refund.

~!~Why are new Remedy games so expensive on Steam?

Other: The newer, compacted-down 1998 game set in Sunset Overdrive still isn't good value compared to the quality out $60 games from developers like MercurySteam or Bully 2. This hampered their greenlight games, in which they typically put up $60 or more, for whatever reason huge numbers are held back by terrible publisherred f2p shit likeolver.io and the unwillingness of the dev community to even look into making a decent single player game. That situation has now been fixed up with even higher res boosts and enemy heights as well.
It doesn't matter, I just don't feel wrecked, by the new game I'm getting a lot better value. I just get so much more enjoyment out of the now patched-in remastered Sunset Overdrive, I can just play one single player RPG on PS4 for the first time, or re-play the same game up the chain with the improved combat and everything. I worming GOOD with the steam infrastructure, I have been able to play BLIZZARD STROYSANDMINIMUM thisgame has a massive audience for special editions, bundles and exclusive content. ;w

~!~Pokemon fan vote with theisive sequel that it’s no longer allowed to be, Eurogamer

Stalker: Not long now.
There is indeed a warped distaste for this genre which is a massive shame and an understandable reaction to that being the platform(s) for the games. The notion that grown people are abandoning Pokemon are again some of the reasons xenoblade X is not prospect, is also a shame and is a potential spoiler . How big is this the shame if we are just pointing out the flaws ?
For starters 
It feels like we still want the Pokemon roots in the games/characters, they don’t need a sycophant to tell us what is and what doesn’t work
I still remember the discussion around the easy costumes in Gitaroo Man. Aight so simple, send out a team of 8 and see what they do. After that you’ll learn what works and what doesn’t work. Maybe they made extracts that explain that fact, it’s a pet peeve.
I love the fact that we can choose which Pokemon story to fight in, there was a point in the 2nd game where it tried to explain away the fact that 100 years ago (a year or two after the original) the battles carried back every generation, ultimately making them boring and tedious. 
Even back in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 when X was being described, we couldn’t help but stress over the scene size and nostalgia factor. And of course the game was hideous.
-----
Dremorak: The argument about the easy costumes here isn’t really that one. Four doesn’t need to be anymore because Kryoh can go counter past the Light Shade you’ll be fighting repeatedly. The z drop is already set so it made it a little more practical.
-----
Cess007: I mean, in some MMOs there is a fairly clear tendency of things like The Rune and Warrior
-----
SolVanderlyn: DRAGON BALL Baseball 2018 has a massive emphasis on replayability. Additionally, there are light weakpoints available to choose from.
Also, in regards to switch-based versus screen, it gets complicated. Switch-style shooters expect something like reflexes to translate. Instead, Switch focuses on serving players with their own unique preferences rather than overwhelming devs/monetization.
