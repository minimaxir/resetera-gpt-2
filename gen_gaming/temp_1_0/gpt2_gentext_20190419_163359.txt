~!~Need help reciting a single-party franchise in a large scale set of games

Bomblord: After finishing up Mario Odyssey, it makes sense that I do every single party/base game and could move on to write about all of them, the ACA entries that I've played, some others that I haven't played, and if possible I want to do a one-party game with my fellow cast to follow up LINK's adventures.
Mainly, I want to do a series of playthroughs or summaries that attempt to compile the best and most coherent lines of the franchise and carrying the franchise forward or forward a portion of the franchise that prior titles had.
If there's something particular I care about, I'd like to request a list or digest that differs from the OP so that I can fit the entire series in for you Era. Artist who can help out or simply want to offer some input.
Rules
Spoiler
NO CROSS SPOILERS
No fan translation unless I can't proof it himself. For example, if someone is fluent in Japanese who would fiddle with that, but I just know him for a few seconds so wouldn't have to jerk around.
What
I wanna play a traditional 2-4 player video game with IRI(or maybe a Comix Zone) co-op. I'd like to play online sequences which have co-op. I want to know options, rather than "Get in Smash and post your stuff here". I'm asking to both play from a couch and not switch.
Anything suo

Fuck man.

P5 is 2003
Why is Atlus giving us another Persona lore dumpster fire?
What about Persona 4's western setting?!

Merkunt: Mobureland is the ranking board of the P5 hype threads, lol.

Kolx: I've got a lot of respect for the man's genuine desire to be better, but not sure if you really have one.

-----
werezompire: It's a terrible game and so are the Gordon Freeman clues.
-----
H2intensity: It looks off. I dislike it a lot , Not sure if its age but in the age of pc OSes and everything it looks even chuggery outside of view.
Yeah misread the discussion.. don't get addicted to it. Its not like there is massive amount of fanservice. I suck at something. I just got to level 43 and its a bunch of filler and filler everywhere I look something else.

~!~Alph Works Releasing Triple Chord, Calling Its "In Progress", Touring Tour Tour Tour phase until end of 2019

Sage: It came out in 2011, and now with their third album out, they are in their third album tour in a while. A new trailer shows off the upcoming album, called In Progress, which might include being shown off to tour-type's. The In Progress album was met with even more skepticism this past summer according to Risky Beats, but they’ve confirmed for FANG and other digital magazine headliners. For a half-minute in the interview with their site Twinel junior editor Jon Cantis, they went back to say that the album was currently scheduled for the summer and is coming later this year.
For Squaresoft, it seems it's looking as rough as the original In Progress songlist. They managed to beat the fucking song in a 3D trackball festival before it was released as a single song in a magazine. Only in their capacity to create new songs, nobody complained about that. 
Generations after Final Fantasy IV’s long development started, they were faced with an even darker situation, though. The studio behind Final Fantasy III and Final Fantasy V was hit with a massive debt load restructuring, it was because their music rights didn’t go up by the public demand. Square Enix themselves chose In-Their-Wonder to re-release it as a part of their own database, which was then completely taken away from them and replaced with the disastrous Grey Goose duet.
-----
Eolz: People always point out that 3D world stuff was their original pitch for FFV musi...
The whole time I was thinking, how cool would an HD remake of 2 and 3 be...?
-----
sschol: Oh, quite nice. Squaresoft is like fucking competent without conventions, they should totally give them all the resources they need for a Handheld remake. Obviously :-)
-----
Joey Ravn: I think their relationship with Enix is a terrible example, not sure how to sympathize enough to split it up.
But I still think Wild Arms 2 falls in so much that I don't know if I'm the only one.

Temascos: Holy shit, now everyone who read this must be nightmare. Legitimately dislike this whole thing, as I feel that it falls short of the Voldo which was a legitimately good game and a fun how to type dialogue with your cute little bot characters.Reset is holding this game.
-----
kurahador: Dead. End of my Lives.
-----
Unknown Soldier: Oh hey, I just remembered this magazine. One of them was like "The Onion" Other one was just... No, it wasn't.

-----
KoolAid: EU magazine doesn't have a partnership with Ubisoft.

Wait.....Nintendo Europe at least was actually EU?

~!~Old video games get new games, new interesting games get better

Exellus: Most of the time these 'quirky new games' win, from 2D formulas backGround to weird and amazing multiplayer surprises, talking of indies getting a try. And if you remember anything from the past decades, you have all the examples of games with small, keybinding changes getting big new releases most recently... The one strike against the plagued sidequests or little experimental indie-games.
A great post by Exellus for a new subgenre gets new content on the PS4 component.
Mod Edit: 
A new singleplayer game gets an update (or been updated). Game releases, cool cosmetic changes, new player mechanics, new ten medals :)
Doesn't have as big an universe as the PS4 games, but compete with Spore and do STUFF with inane goals like CONGRATS and BPKs rather than ASMR if you remap both channels.
About Character Action games, I love SMT World (but i think it is kinda the same or even inferior version, it is a side game with a Manif Pour Quick Play element with 8 characters like the settings in the lab) if you read the article, the theme of SMT is that you "play as high school students" in a single player "speed match," and you transform your enemies to super powerful demons you can damage through weapon/spell and manipulate score/one-scoring etc.
Super excited for get started period. That will be why i'm a r/PS4 moderator later on, just like we are with media consumption.
lol too soon for announcement. But yep, here it is. Just kidding around the big announcement.
I love the story "apparently" spyware was used to hack PS4, base was 3.61 or something like that. Likely an unlock system or something. Was hoping it would be 3.63, just a minor patch (like rollback patches) but maybe that is all we needed. About PC patch, its set to work just like PS4 has now. Maybe add Ryzen cpu blocks. Around that time we could start Discussing the possibility of an XBone. ;)
Yes im just trolling, but bruh the thread isnt dying yet. Someone Resign Teaser already? ;)

~!~Sakurai's Thoughts on Duck Hunt (much smaller than it was at E3)

Ehoavash: Direct link to interview in Famitsu asking deff is talked about in the TG16 thread 
Regarding loot based games: 
"Have you ever wondered what the sales potential of a loot based game is? It’s nothing like Ninja Gaiden, Racquel or Ninja Gaiden - these 4 games are fighting games. But with loot based games, I believe that it’s something the average person would see, seeing it’s a way of showing peripheral and hobbyists that loot games are worthwhile investments being on sale and playing them": 
 
Much smaller than it was during E3, but i'm very surprised that Sakurai has come out firmly on the GG Era bandwagon. Tee Winning Tee, the supposed successor to the original Clay system in Smash Ultimate only just opened recently (3 days) in pretty much all the talk about the game
-----
vestan: 
-----
Certinfy: What did earlier sales actually show? My guess is if E3 moved more than 5x the number due to Shovel Knight, of course. The return of Wave Race and Sonic Mania was huge as well.
-----
karmitt: Begs the question, but I think it's fairly obvious with just about every game announcement.
-----
Alethiometer: Not surprising. though it's good to see being able to jump into weird games after not having played them for like 2 years and see that their gameplay hold up
-----
Abylim: I remember hearing about being able to pick up Crimson Curse on one of the big 3DS eShop sales. Does those still count?
-----
KingdomHeartsFan: Was 2020 really?
-----
JazzmanZ: Reminds me of almost every other year
-----
Epilexia: Not only have they built a huge mood around the franchise, but this change in feeling was made during the holiday season.
It's not a coincidence that instead of a reignited hype last season, it marks the most legs-eating and core-consumer friendly E3 all across.
EA, Ubisoft, Bethesda - all big publishers- are zooming past the gacha sub-game in a lot of individual matches (both individual and ranked-based-elimination matches).

Xavi: This is gods
====================
~!~Early Access for the GBA SP was amazing... and it probably should be a thing

TheDanger: Things I came across recently:
- The SP mode
- Here's the requirements to get to SP in the good way of unlocking all the SP minigames block the SP. 
- Select a character of your choosing (We chose classic Ridley but it's pixel perfect, lets' you play as evil incarnate if you so choose). 
- One level at a time as you're advancing. Hold down X and you'll get a descending of sounds like the end of a level while watchping with power-ups. 
- Suspend SP and you'll get cutscene kicks. 
- You can pause SP and the cutscenes sort of happily as they follow you. 
- Forza Horizon 3 has an online for SP play to give you time to practice seamless in multiplayer. 
- 
So the next step is that expect people to be willing to pay for the SP, companions free download for all to help them out as they would have all sorts of benefits for totally free if not free. 
Pros. Free with games. If you bought it in the sale, you get to play 
- Battletoads 
- Mario Kart 64 have a SP mode inspired by KI
- Star Fox Legacy Collection on Switch?
Cons. I mean....it might as well be a product added all the time by Nintendo and Retro and Rockstar famously not making games for online and leaving them to just abandon the development?
-----
FireWarrior: i was actually downloading the popperie Ms game
here's the sp content is nowhere near as entertaining
-----
PabloTheThird: Ohhh, so just turn the sp stuff in the options like this gave me as a no gba only bud.
-----
TheDanger: Haha I was going for this in the hopes that in smash there will be a reskinned tag team mode and in-game creator tools. ARK mode can be whole new game don't they do this to companies already?
-----
Mifec: At least they'll charge you retro bucks.
-----
TheDanger: Maybe I missed it, but Nintendo Online Netflix is for free! I assumed if the sp stuff was unlikely to be added from the sale I would have got the service but that's just me.

~!~Dying Light: Bloodstained [Switch] developer intensifies their effort to take full advantage of Switch OS features

Hero of Legend: Interesting tidbit: Last not segmented as in these last couple of months, Dying Light is still supposedly just barely on the user's list for OS features, especially in regards to accessibility. I guess EA's omission of Bloodstained was suggested more as a discussion for developer intensifying and literally minutes away from release.
I just don't know who on the team cringing the most and the longer the project goes on, even on PC.
-----
GodofWine: Well, that was a nice surprise. now if I play thru some of their games I will definitely give it at some point and once I have played and wallet.
-----
weebro: Besides the technical strength of the Switch OS perhaps they're a force for good carrying the torch of NMS. Hyped for the next one.
-----
Epinephrine: I signed up for an early access basis, for the first time in ages. Glad to see more guys and girls can do it! NMS, also and far from dead in comparison, has something to prove.
-----
Hero of Legend: Oh... hell, all is good...
Blood will someday be so epic I hope!

~!~Awful products that allow you to exploit systems in awful ways with little or no warning?

Dust: We all have stuff like this in video games, right? 
You keep trying basic things, without success, but the frustration just continuously gets greater. Also don't get too excited if your product doesn't meet your expectations.
Remember to not go in looking for the only things you had to "waste" or "did the testing already".
-----
matimeo: Dumping and plugging your product windows will send you to a better version if you fuck up. If you get too far you will lose the game somehow (maybe even look into that) if you disregard everything else all together.
-----
Zoon: I like a green screen on a PC instead of a reminder that I should update your account. Means I never get my money back.
-----
JoDa: A reminder that my action is my money and I can use to bypass unlocking for the no action system
-----
BadWolf: Do you even know who it is from here?
-----
Mzril: I only need a now to claim redeploys anymore. So I can't go back and remove the redeploy if I messed up and also can't access the account.
Dreams will run fine i think.
-----
massoluk: I suggest you Develogers do the boot to difference shit with the triggers and make it different
-----
Deft Beck: I never do stuff like this unless I can actually see the ticking in my product to bypass it.
-----
arbok26: Windows shreds like a poorly programmed Chevry.
If you can't 1 get a good workforce to clean it, then that's a kick in the gut for Savanna but then definitely fail signantly.
I just wonder if Gamepass on a PC will spark such issues. I usually don't like digital tools but could pick up the of a given company and game on there as opposed be upgrading to be competitive.
-----
BrutalInsane: I think that’s because if something is advertised that you aren’t prepared for in game to have any warning anywhere so the rant comments get way too long attention anyway spams should be standard in consumer electronics such as malware.

~!~ which handheld used the most (via Switch Dock Pro)

daTRUballin: So I just wanted to just get an idea myself. I’ve been curious about a possible port to the 3DS. I’ve beaten Xenoblade on WiiU and now I’m looking at a couple [good] games for the Switch. 
To be more specific, I have a 3DS in two hands by now and I’m loving the switch dock pro. I told my friends and one JRPG producer that I’d prefer to use Steam’s PNW when playing Monster Hunter World. They all agreed it was the best way to play Monster Hunter and it’s been great so I figured even though my situation wasn’t as extreme as yours, I’d still get it. I’ve also had it for awhile and the bump in button presses make my eyes pop up numerous times when I use it to flip over monster lists and options. Being a Switch owner and limited to a 4K capable TV/Most recently, Kirby Star Allies I’m thinking of picking this up and it’d seem like a good portable option.
But that’s not actual portability and full battery life means it’s down to a bit of a a mystery. Been a few times where the battery life of my switch has died and haven’t had to figure something that big into it, such as Bluetooth/USB wireless networks. And even in handheld mode it’s a bit of a mystery, such as the signal being blocked, wifi teritory, etc. Full battery replays or even USB wired games is completely random on the Switch, so I’m wondering on what the overall consensus is. Can some folks help me out here and provide me a link?

Platy: Nintendo Selects

Lite_Agent: I'm gonna go WMR. Still pretty expensive as everything else carries over here :\

Svart: I own a Switch Wii U.
It is amazing.

ULTROS!: So back on November 15th to be exact.
I had that crust up until I realized there was no thread after that (due to Mach's ongoing stream) and I just realized there werent 2 new threads on the same day.
I assume its coming up down at least, whatcha got in your head?

QisTopTier: Who and what is this lmao
-----
shark97: what if I’m waiting for Sekiro to get a good time to save the systems lmao
-----
Buddy: What if it ends the year with a bang?
-----
Outrun: I haven't considered if the next AC belongs to Gen 8 yet. 
The open world stuff appeals a lot to me but I can't say I'm very hyped for it. I think it's a really solid entry in the series.
-----
Gevurztraminer: Coming to PC shortly. Can't wait to play it!
-----
NoMoreTrolls: I bet we bump the thread on this one too, lol
Hmm I guess if nothing gets OS support that à guess that nobody else will care.
-----
RedSwirl: I wanna know what Miyazaki's theory about compatibility holds true: It's highly likely that if you start playing a system from the GBA, all mods, lighting, and even UI textures are applied independently to that system.

~!~What were your best gaming memories from the early 2000's?

melodiousmowl: I think many people can relate to my thread about happiest birthday. There are a lot of things I remember vividly.
For me, my birthday was the very first time I ever saw the PS2 and PSP Remakes. 
My dad rented the ps2 and I think it had my fav games ever and what fun it was, 10 x fav games per month (or I believe, 27 game disc games per month?) 
I could not imagine the games that would have been on shelves for a long time. The change to X360 (or at least I could assume, to backwards compatibility) made every game at the time quite attractive. 
The first game sitting (upon redoing the puzzle rooms again) was predictably an odd game. Off the top of my head was the NES Add Quest. It was another mish mash of systems/mechanics and graphics/design but for some reason I remember it best: Mario kart 3 no end at launch in dual stick mode, saving/getting Meat Boy levels on a rolling game(the story mode also took umbrage with me; it was on ice level for my dumb ear,) and the first bosses were super looooooooooooooooooooooooooongbo
-----

====================
~!~We’d like to hear, if any Anthem characters ship in Dec 2nd 2019.

MAX PAYMENT: Looks like charcter. They should be good. Sucks you don’t have Day/Night as DLC that is.
-----
Transistor: I'd rather have Cliffy B than the game
-----
Daniel Westlake: The lack of new footage is a real turn off for some players but thanks for pointing it out imho.
-----
Soph: Just give me Yvesemb and the Solo medusa avatars.
-----
Tonky: I might back the Deluxe version if I can actually get them to ship with weapons or equipment. Eventually I might give it a shot, but surely if they offer anything substantial to sell me – who knows!
-----
dreams: I will wait for a bunch of statik.
-----
Kalentan: I wasn't paying attention but reports said all three characters are coming.
-----
ckareset: Why no flying characters though?
-----
Apollo: Maybe Epic owes a lot to the Anthem Traveller. There's a flight mode I can't remember off the top of my head.

KingSnake: What fluff writer or artists are you talking about btw?
Also, much appreciated.

~!~Are this thing a mental illness or a visual illness?

King of Dreamland: (MIR)Jawmuncher
jawmuncher thread was pretty preeckless when I first started going through this thread. During my time with it, I threw myself into the game world because it was my own free time and made it my own thing that I am the player of this game world and am in this- this bad guy was, when I first started playing it, giving us small presents that were clearly needed help in some way. Of course I used this to be somewhat responsible for things like shirts getting scratched by hipsters who want to keep it together. However I felt it become catch-up to my free time for personal reasons. At some point, I have a problem anyway and thought I should just put something out. But my behavior and life because of the game world changed pretty bad. 
In my old age, I am not a kid. My parents were not healthy people, my dad was not strong, I didn't have a good career arc other than playing video games. Somehow things started acting out for me. In the end I wanted to change those things but I selfishly knew it wouldn't happen.
Anyway, with all of this, I just wanted to share a thought 
Yeah, this happened to me too. But I completely knew that generally speaking, it fucked me up at that point. It’s just bad. But I realized I was curious and asked others ,since they all play video games and I wasn’t in high school
Good call guys. Is this thing any worse than mental illness? Or is it more of a visual illness?
Thanks in advance for any input.
Edit
Ninja Exploder released this video.
-----
Neural:Your best friend and I have had a falling out (sort of) recently; it can be rough at times. As a kid, my teachers made fun of me for preferring Ratchet "roleplay" shooters over co-op platformers (which I also preferred to games outside of your bubble). By the end of high school, I had trouble responding to the criticism, but when I felt motivated, I would play myself. But afterward, I would talk about cross-dressing a girl a few years ago and tell her to protect herself. That was all sort of regular coz I couldn’t see myself falling into.

~!~Sony hiring manager (Schwardrobe) at Sony EGS to Senior Producer job

Aokiji: Job posting says this:
-----
CarthOhNoes: I believe that’s being referred to as a new position, though maybe the idea for NLX was discussed already and didn’t materialize? Doesn’t really say anything anyone tells you.
Mobile gamer ran with "Boy meets fashion model" label.
-----
The Last Wizard: Beyond simcade?
-----
Aokiji: I think all of the models are from Sony as I’m not sure the other ones are from other publishers or if just one. I’ve had many phone calls for confirmation but no confirmation lines still ha
-----
Nolbertos: Saw some Fibertrax reviews and btw, feel free to answer any questions guys. Love job posting and business :)
-----
N.Domixis: Neat!!
First Sony job hit me hard
-----
Kanann: Is this career divas, Raiju or Luftau?
-----
Rryush: Talimiss instead of butter? :(
I get you're a fashion model, but this position seems so random I can't field a nomination.
-----
Lukemon: Wow, if it's a reviewer that's writing a review of an explicitly devised summary of a game mechanic or scenario rather than a human being with an actual job that identifies itself to review aspects like graphics or music, I wonder if I would be more inclined to take the job.
Edit: I got hired as a reviewer - has one jobhare - srs, lets go! And why is that? Is it that? Is it criticism towards a known or mentioned game mechanic or is it - intentionally or not?

====================
~!~Will Beta PS4 titles Deep Down ever come to Windows Store?

Ōkami Haundo: I just got some keys for two of these titles during my Seagate Firecuda in the mail. One of them (The under-world survivalist) is gorgeous as usual, and the other one (The simulation survivalist) looks and plays fantastically, so I can’t really say if they offer anything strong enough for Windows Store.
I’m not the kind of person that feels obligated to play these kind of games on PC, but I'll see if I can find one to throw my backlog into (Word is that there is a server requirement for the servers to maintain the recommended specs, which sounds like a really crappy achievement, but I won’t act like that is a good thing).
These are the two I’m interested in:
Two for $21.50 a month. I don’t interest in deep discounts on Xbox due to having run SandStone for months prior. Anyone know any of these games that are worth the effort? Worth not being on Steam?
-----
Mipmap: I looked in to this recently and the key doesn't show up for me anytime soon, despite being asked about it last week. Could this be because of the upcoming distributor apocalypse?
-----
Mr.Deadshot: At the moment, it seems fairly likely to be one of those 100,000 copies that was "requested" to come to Windows Store. It comes with Game Pass. 
No announcement about bc ports, just Sony/DMC5/Dragon's Dogma/Zelda World on the main site.
-----
zsynqx: I kinda feel this way about Dreams a lot. Kinda excited for the cheapest PS4 game I've seen until said sponsored + deluxe
-----
z1yin9c: Thought they offered support for those who upgraded £18 a year......
Yes !!!
*shrugs
-----
Ōkami Haundo: I think Microsoft is pretty strict with PSN key resellers and this is a question many of these key sellers are putting their good seal on. Definitely a first for me.
-----
LewieP: Seems silly to try and compete with a big company like Apple when the entire marketplace is just Google and Amazon who can do it as well.

~!~Sea of Thieves MV - Day one $30 savings

bsigg: Just listed on my profile so I couldn't find a thread about it but just wanted to give a heads up since some people might say it's heavily discounted at participating shops.
If you have GCU or PS+. They put a probable $35 is too expensive for most. The game has been out for less than 3 months now and it's on sale for $35, so whether you would wait a full day or a quick profit for buying down the line feels like an easy decision.
-----

====================
~!~Hideki Kamiya is cancelling his full-game development starting on March 7.

vestan: Just announced at Jump Festa. Supposed to be Shorying World Tour.
Both games have had 1/3 of their development teams due at restay. So it's only a matter of time before he says something and officially announces his full development is over.
-----
Joey Pockett: i hope he's sweating and he's picking his feet up
-----
SolidSnakex: He's in the process of being laid off.
-----
Gegz: Yeah he's not leaving, not officially at the studio, still trying to stay afloat.
-----
VatticStyle: Kamiya is gonna DQ right now right?
-----
vestan: 4 other notable devs are cleared I assume.

Tribal24: glad for the man

He had 1 day to speak about him quitting, and found out free in his work lol

~!~I really want a new Pixel Game

Chaeotic: So there has been an interesting absence of originalive game titles. The flip side of the coin is that there is a very robust community on the platform. PSN, XBL, TFG, itch.io all spring to mind. They've all received fan made collections though. However, due to their design simplicity my interest in original titles has subsided a lot, not even close to the level of what could be done today. 
However it doesn't seem to be how a pixel polished, polished a game would look if it was made in such a rigid time frame. Games are ready for an accessible format, maybe we even have a benched platform that can generate concepts of developness for a new game and it's done right through the getting right to be able to go where the ip

SleepSmasher: I think one good take on an actual change for a submission check. *cough* For whatever reason they thought, "We don't make money on submission check tools." Well they didn't and their own tools are fine. Not going to say they don't earn a profit, but this is an issue in that they put up a great opportunity to do one better.

Richter1887: This is their own fucking incompetence.
They decide to only license their software when they already have tons of microtransactions put in on their PC version, and until working emulated games are finished they will forever just make changes, and no guarantee they will be successful. They start to develop red tape and more expensive shit by the end. Like they could have just let the devs port things they wanted and let them keep their IP for another decade, or just do another Gerstmann's album. 
They come back to us to announce this contract with some internet fame though.

~!~"Battlefront 2" Developer Balance Making A Lot Of Sense (Open Spoilers inside)

Rocco: Guess the game was having real controversy should've made it's major expansion fairly soon though. I'm kind of reminded of Metro Exodus issues, things like the chapter in-game log would've made for some better moments.
"May 22 (press f" before the update launches) – This can cause engine troubles, and it's the first game to come to mind since FC5.
March 9 (press c) - Another big orange blur appears when you approach a door juts. Should only do this if you're near a train. No point in complaining when you don't know for certain if it's the random stop.
June 17 (press c) – Another issue from FC5: the plus flying wheel. Should be much easier. Also anyone already playing the update?
If you aren't currently playing Bf1:
Spoiler
 could also be related to the size of the base faction difference, how many map defenders are complaining about inb4 capture attempts. It's all there and the in-base overhaul doesn't seem to change that.

~!~I was too late for yet another PS VR "experience"

Yinyangfooey: This time, I'm on board.
I decided to track down a late release version of PS VR and... it never came out. After over a decade of trying, I finally got the chance to play the thing. The headset itself is cheap and I just got it for a few bucks through AstroBots - also for the first time since I have never used the headset before.
What can I say? There aren't enough PS VR games in my library... yet.
Firewall Zero Hour comes out today but that's more than enough for me. The full game is also plug and play on the lack of PS VR support.
If that doesn't convince you then PM HERE !!!
-----
PurgeJuls: He's dead wrong
-----
PurelyChris: Good game. If you only remember VR and haven't played VR, I say definitely buy it. It's a really great game.
-----
kennyamr: I had a PS4 for a year when it launched and I played Pavlov for a few hours. Great and simple idea for a horror experience.
They fixed it 5 years ago and it was really great and I still have it with many games.
But the canned movie aspect killed it with movies. In my experience they are a so-so VR experience in terms of immersion and are a key reason why I want to play PS VR.
The variety of PSVR library is insane.
To offer a better experience... I strongly recommend RE7. I had to sell it because Capcom was charging 100$ for it. VR supersampled it and that game looked... very good.
At least the MP was fun.
-----
leng jai: Play Pavlov. Don't waste your time with Resident Evil or Jurassic World. Play Pavlov.

Boy Wander: Promised Land is one of the best VR games on consoles. People should check it out even if they haven't tried VR.

====================
~!~How do low resolution games work?

Aswitch: Have resolutions getting low, games that are at 11ms lag all over again are out of the spec. Low was hoping to find out how they work to get 1440ish visuals, but they just copied so much of CryEngine code in an older build that it's literally as ugly as someone once was. 
Games usually don't use high resolution all that often, often running at 240p. Same goes for VESA standard. 
Try Low DPI, Sony hardware has this as well, and they all map to edges well.  Cater to everyone that wants res without looking ugly - and consoles can go higher.
-----
Kuraudo: big benched image quality isn't just visual stutter. Even at 15dpi. 
Bad image quality is one of games biggest threats.
 resolutions have room for optimizing output and some use... Soft low DPI.
-----
Lant_War: It was quite surprising during the Heli Bobble FPS demo when you have to count the pixels on the screen, IIRC. I guess the dev even uses different pixel decoder so whatever.
Well to avoid from being corporate apologists: no higher resolution games display enough res.
Good image quality is not possible in full frame.
-----
Box: The best low resolution games come from Capcom.
-----
Butch: I dunno it happens a lot. I've mined images at low resolution from E3 and all the good ones shouldn't go lower.
-----
OuterLimits: Ultra wide images actually work pretty well on most TVs to lower quality because being so high quality means not rendering at native res. AMD gets the first attempt a bit by using techniques that stop per pixel for superficial reasons.
A lot of great high quality, smaller "bad" quality 1080p wide starts at 2160p and scales up quite fast in most cases due to the 30 FPS+ cap. Low values can even have a huge cap larger than 240.
The best high resolution games are when your image isn't compressed with the UI and gameplay, so a weighted ton of uniform textures are always a good thing, as well as texture filtering that helps create cleaner, varied gradients and color diversity. 
Higher res, cluttered textures can also have differing results depending on the assets you're working with. 
GTX 1080 has full texture filtering and TAA, SS

~!~Australia does not allow Cross-Buy titles on Steam

Zurick: While having GCU and Gold Memberships on Steam I found it harder to actually play Fifa 18 and R6 Mercenaries on my Switch.
What's weird is, I can buy the game and use my GCU and Gold Member Cards on Steam. Europe & America are on Steam. It's not a problem that Europe and the UK don't allow Cross-Buy for Steam games.
-----
Nappael: Nintendo Direct in Australia does allow it... at least for some titles. 
I haven't tried it but I keep buying so many games that I get a weird anxiety as there's no way to cancel the subscription.
-----
AWizardDidIt: Never messed with my friends buying a bunch of games I was planing on cancelling to buy during the Direct. In fact I made sure I shortened their username to %CSX% so they knew I had both. Had no idea.
-----
Nappael: FYI FW: we do NOT allow the sale of split Joystick splitters games on Steam.
See also: why these first party games aren't shareable, and the news might spur Valve to pull the buyout.
-----
wwm0nkey: This has been happening for years and they could just change it for the direct even if they didn't allow it
-----
wwm0nkey: Yeah they need to just change it but I mean FOR ME I agree, I would just make some on the other stores, the wiiU/WiiU games already came to wiiU, not Valve
-----
wwm0nkey: They had weekly sales, after work it was a lot better since then
-----

~!~Why are people obsessed with the final case for old-school amiibo ?

Operationgamer17: That is the last time I thought there'd be a proper appreciation for amiibo figures and their cases for this forum. 
The phantoms quickly become a nuisance to collect after Nintendo's must-own titles sell particularly well. Though they have become increasingly rare as time has turned and their prominence has been concentrated more on smaller games that still tend to have the rare cases for them (Super Mario Odyssey became an exception).
I suspect this is a common request for these collectors. Though I have yet to get to play any of the "complete" collections, perhaps one day, I've started noticing more and more collectors hollonges and amiibo collectors storm into the Nintendo eShop. Obviously there's a lot of competition on the eshop, despite my reluctance to buy online (I buy games from pretty much any third party seller). 
It's gotten me to thinking, why on Earth I'm so obsessed with these collector items? Mostly granted, they're much more desirable these days, and more people buy them! 
 
Whether you hate em or not, amiibos are still prevalent for various collect games (you can have several sold at GOG or No Man's Sky on the current marketplace...). The Dark Souls collection and Art of Nico Nizzarre is available on the eShop to purchase online. Consider this your final warning before buying any collection; you cannot have more than 50% off, or one item at a time, during the current market.
-----
lacer: Gravelifter
-----
Escalario: It's a great game and the music is great, yeah. I rarely dislike amiibo though, and I dont have an amiibo with many games.
Just buy it.
-----
sir_crocodile: Except it's not that kind of collector item.
Buy 20 plus fancy accessories or second hand ones
-----
TheMoon: this owners guide and amiibo threads about your every request for woooong
I agree with this, while I hate them all I keep the urge strong! 
Amiibo in general will anger you more than the entire transaction itself.
-----
skittzo0413: Note here, your list of amiibo does not include the amiibo itself. Go for one that you expect

~!~Bayonetta : is 2D formula OK ? Or something more appealing ?

Neiteio: I love Bayonetta ( no GOTY) and by now most people know the finished name Datto, though that nickname has been thrown around like crazy lately. Though I love 2D action games so I remain optimistic. 
But that excitement, feeling that Datto + something unique about this formula is somehow making other Bayonetta 3D style games? Or from a games no longer available not make themselves... I'd be happy. 
As far as the status of 2D action games, are we more positive ? Or have any other promising games effected your mind ?
-----
King of Dreamland: It depends
-----
Neiteio: I mean, out of all the games I've played of 2018, Bayonetta 3 is meh. Also already taken back by MHW, which is noteworthy at least
-----
cj_iwakura: Probably less than zero. 2d action games can make 3d games more appealing.
-----
NotLiquid: Wonderful 101 did in my impression
-----
lvl 99 Pixel: No one has really come up with a good non-duh action game in the last ~2 years but come on meta schlock
but it's gonna have legs
-----
Dreamboum: Wonderful 101 and Wonderful 101 X Monster are very good 2D action games. Wonder if it’d be viable in Japan
-----
AgentOtaku: I suppose if you take it a step further, it arbitrarily limits Bayonetta to being fighting with guns. Though I know this isn’t how to sell the good things of Bayonetta these days necessitating constant QoL changes, so essentially, the next entry needs to be set in the Bayonetta world
-----
FluxWaveZ: People are obviously very undervaluing what 2D action can bring. It'd probably be a good game to quate in a big group without a group mode. That's a game that doesn't need ANY graphical overhaul (really it looks great), and it probably wouldn't cost as much and require at least a little more than the usual 2D games for it to be commensurate with its style.
The joy of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta feels a little like dear war for some reason at high school. The high school setting with all the cool new monsters

~!~Is the Switch's "Family" really as bad as people make it out to be?

Forkball: Figure out if this is a publisher suggestion. It is not. Are you implying the Switch's playability is at dangerously low levels, or is the Switch about to reach the point of being unacceptable to basically everyone else because the core idea is to have family for instruction?
I imagine not. It's an ergonomic problem for the lifestyle and I have noticed if given the option and that sort of thing lots of people strangely uncomfortable with that mode. I have generally gone for single player, and the console doesn't fully realize that yet.
To give an example, there's no problem if Nintendo "choose to play the right game" option. This doesn't mean that point can be brought to a point where they can say, "leak something and hand out praise for ERA or something." Is that on developers of the medium? Could be that, Man, I just want a title I can
-----
MattyG: I think it's probably the more future rewarding mode as it has a more upfront presentation, but the core is still integral to the actual games. I think later upgrades and such are going to be what the next platform for such modes.
Edit: meant easiest to deny because Nintendo really seemed to focus on broadening the idea of family stuff with FE unbent except in in a browser browser.
-----
nsilvias: the nx/xl demos are clearly worse.
-----
Gaia Lanzer: There was a dedicated family/parental play option that is part of the early Switch version. I've still had them dusted off often. I don't know if the switch version will utilize this type of thing. Hopefully however the witm version of the classic lost childrens game isn't without it's fans.
Rom bonuses give a nice challenge too
-----
Aters: Only if you have access to the Virtual Console. You will have a new copy if you ask me.
-----
Servbot24: Off course that's common, but saying families are bad is probably mostly anecdotal anyway.
-----
Tofer: Have you seen how often Nintendo markets a campaign method like Tactics? That effectively has ruined games like xenoblade 2 and perfect 7.
It's not good, but well

~!~Make Pitfall Vs. Pitfall Been Fun!

Bobo Dakes: It's been a while since I've played but I want to admit that I recognize something I haven't seen more pancale.
Pitfall Vs. Pitfall hasn't gone anywhere yet. I know the PS4 port got testing ago and while it seemed at launch at least a polished product, for those that played on PS4 not sure if it's the best product. Most of the game is street fighter and the beta really seemed a success so far, I haven't watchedmuch new in this thread and I feel like for those that put more time into Mortal Kombat I'm there day 1 but Pitfall in Smash would be just perfect baby. 
The gameplay in this has so iffy that I almost gave up till Forza Horizon 4. 
The RNG in this also kind of fucked me up for a while so I didn't get a wonderful veg out once I got a loot box - yeah I did get consumable items straight away. The annoyingest part was waiting 3 minutes for my anima to stop animaly's movement and then I knew I had to raise it so slow for Pitfall. It didn't compute and it almost always landed it in the sky. 
Thought the Mecha Trip was a nice way of seeing more of deltarune. 
Anyone else seen this? I've never played it.
-----
Cess007: I think I agree with you, I'm mostly only into the game's first hour or so.
Watching the video made me think P3 on PS2 had terrible reaction controls, and while they fixed that, it's on par with people dropping in Smash.
-----
Napalm_Frank: Pitfall has already really lived up to my expectations and I just picked it up while I wait for Forza Horizon 4.

Yerffej: So cool! Good podcast partner. Glad he did.

lvl 99 Pixel: In general it seems like P3 has (pretty much always) ass beaten everything on all the Wii-U era WiiUs by immortalize their gems as Blockbuster Media, and I could even say that P4G has just been a PvE experience where you mostly have to hit X to trigger the 1s. Not exactly intuitive, I know.

~!~Go Evolution looks to be the best Animal Crossing game for years!

Meelow: Have been itching for a new place ever since the big new Animal Crossing game announced. Then Go Vacation came out, then it had a demo, then it never went on sale because of very limited availability, the last sale was like 4yrs ago.
While Go Vacation is amazing, it looks very much like a 3rd Person Super Mario game with the few new New wrinkles. It looks like a very open platformer (think Mario 64 DS or DS Lite (puzzle design in a platformer). You can jump, climb, get picked up, talk, dance, do tricks and a few more) with tons of mini games as well as different social interactions.
I feel like so many people thought this was a bad game because the trailer made it seem like you played a similiar way to play Animal Crossing. In fact I feel like the game looks like a mobile version of New Super Mario Bros. U DX, which makes me blush.
I'm excited! I need to be this amazed at Go VR for some time.
I have been in a falling out of the 3D world game mode a while, but that was a spin-off style game, not a proper animal crossing game (despite being a spinoff thana big dlc, the most recent one being nearly field of characters away from Verum Rex).
I'm excited! I got better at Animal Crossing than I did New 3DS. I need to play Go Vacation like every other Animal Crossing game by comparison
Just a shame Ape Escape was ported to the PS4 as a spin-off, like Wario Ware Gold, and it was
Very excited.

Also I forgot to say in the OP some proper words for difficulty! Cats are never really enemies, all checkpoints should be Tess crosses.

Ricky64: Claymore smh....
For those wondering what it's all about. It looks like a point away from defeating a boss (to certain encounters), and the pointer controls for Parasyze are nothing special and off putting.

The latest Crysis games have a PS4 Slim version that overclocks to 8C which is noticable.
Valkyria Chronicles has turbo mode, you switch from the Turbo/Ultra mode and then hard reset to Normal mode as a result.

~!~NVIDIA Ending Support for Sponsors

kostacurtas: NVIDIA’s long-time support and support for free, on-source building platforms has come to an end. NVIDIA has sunsetuted support for free on-source drivers announced earlier this year, according to a June 10 letter they sent to drivers who currently provided support for NVIDIA Volta. NVIDIA’s only hope left was to sunset their support in 2019, the June 12 letter said. The 25 percent cap was NVIDIA’s only hope this year.
The dwindling support, though, has largely been driven by NVIDIA abandoning its FreeSync partners. The company told PowerStone last month it wasn’t a "long-term goal" for the support, but that if you played games running on the FreeSync-enabled monitor and output the full 1080p signal to the monitor it should work.
Before awhile also ceased the support for FreeSync, NVIDIA had about 3.5 years of support with the latest FreeSync drivers. At least someone made a Plex server for this purpose.
Keep in mind, however, that the miners have basically never reported for letting up for free since March, according to developer Vyten. NVIDIA has not officially allowed sponsored sponsors to use their APIs, but you can still register a sponsorship request, log on with your sponsor account, and get a transaction approved, provided you pass a security testing process.

TheUnseenTheUnheard: It being hardware agnostic in nature might mean that is for the premium gaming PC market.
-----
New Fang: GPUs agnostic in nature would be a surprise.
-----
Interkindal: Yeah. Gsync for console would be a more solid bet as it covers the vast majority of the specs for 1440p 144hz monitors.

CGiRanger: I hope they throw in that a quick while ago. Let the hype entice them.

GHG: I doubt they announced Dreamcast support.

~!~So, who died first in a Battle Royale?

deejay8595: Battle royals are usually the best games in a genre, but one of my most disappointing recent ones has been BR games. 
To give you an idea about what I mean, I was playing A-AA. I'm trying to broke through with 12 kills in 12 hours on Nov.ru Pinball FX Pinball by itself just to get that 12 bucks it costs at the beginning. The community around The Battle Royale has been absolutely shredded after the First Act which is kind of the height of reaching
Tomb raider was a boss. Children and 80 deadbolts. Red horse was the legend.
Since I just start to pay attention to this stuff, one thing that I would really like to know is: which kind of games are BR and which ones are PBR? The ones I haven't got, but I want to read what ERA thought.
-----
Nikus: Shadowrun: Hong Kong for sure. It is pretty comparable to Devil May Cry, but has a kind of HP-focused combat design where you might use the weapon wheel to shrink your health, which you can then equip on the fly. The game is sort of like Street Fighter II, with particular emphasis on horizontal movement vs. vertical, so it's not exactly a game you run, jump, push a button and you'll pretty much be doing all sorts of shitty stuff.
-----
Parenegade: The order. Sometimes a few days you could have the very best. I loved it when it was first released for Undertale, but since then it's been difficult to get myself hooked. The inventory part is a nightmare and(is) an annoying mechanic also.I found it easier a game before having to switch weapons).
-----
Perzeval: PUBG was alright until you got to the end.
-----
TheCyborg Demon: Shadowrun Hong Kong. PUBG is the correct answer unfortunately. Probably the closest order
-----
Twonny: Shadowrun fits the title of thread. Cant really get into the beta.
-----
Take5GiantSteps: Shadowrun probably. PUBG is going to dilute things and the gameplay might be frustrating after I finally redeemed one and got all scores.
-----
DontHateTheBacon: Have one or two with Soulsborne games. The focus tends to be on guns.

"hardcore" peachette now has an extensive UE upgrade so most things it seems lack.... probably a motherboard component while developers add their own custom components to the dev machines.
-----
wwm0nkey: Is the developer console UE3?
-----
Zool: It definitely lessens boot times. I am sure Epic will get more time with UE but I’ll wait for reviews of the game then figure it out
-----
Alastor3: I will be very disappointed if this UE patch doesn't add new feature, i want a machine that can run the game 
ALL THINGS REWARDS
-----
Komo: I wonder if Epic will remove them for no reason.
-----
wwm0nkey: Ive been waiting for an UE release though
-----
Zool: Thanks.
-----
wwm0nkey: They really aren't going to stifle development to add some features (now that they have the last sonu..) so if they're not remotely going to Require any ? That's the bigger fear for them.
-----

I expect they can roll it back somehow =(

It's okay that they're releasing a big game on a single day and introducing 4 other days, even if they were maximizing the value of the early access period.

Spinko: Well, for me personally - Smash kind of is how hell I know to wait till the next week. A big single-player "Mario Kart" game comes out the same day as Smash Bros. And by week 2,fingers drawn and air dance will be as goof land.

Civilstrife: I booted up my copy of InMafia Before the Storm and dug around looking for dirt and zero articles found that it had been released or that there was any actual improvement in the last 2 weeks.
Any progress? Having not played since 2015, do you think I should go back and play this beat free of charge?
-----
KunaiDrilla: I think it was time waiting for people to enjoy it.
-----
BreezyLimbo: Not claiming it's progress is perfect or whatever, but I would not say they made any progress.
-----
VeePs: It’s a good game with worse cutscenes. At least they cleaned up the gore. 
Literally 1 main plot line weak and both boring and shallow, and the ending was just 100% about extra grinding.
-----
Akai: I played for like an hour or so before stopping because I wasn't paying enough attention. I would stay if I got too far to do so, it seems like normally how the main games would be with a solid initial campaign. Still, I have no idea why they dropped the campaign after this, especially when a game with a GOTG its third season out in Japan, does anyone know what happened after that? Man, the level of quality this game had was nothing short of remarkable.
-----
samthebreadman: I played the whole thing and found it to be a mediocre game. Story isn't anything overly amazing, just 7/10 IMO and leads to a rather poor final chapter. Visually it's what I remember, it really looks & feels like the original in terms of rendering.
-----
sredgrin: It's still kinda cool after all these years, and even getting it a better pixel density/graphics card doesn't bring it near to the heights expected for a still sorta average game (IE SFV still had flaws for me)
-----
10k: You'll never question one of the best elements of the game's design, utilizing its unique mechanics at its very best in this case. 
From a complete technician standpoint it was an extremely fresh experience, but the story, cutscenes, and dialogue were all trite and boring, and it was an incredible, yet kind of entertaining experience. With a better engine and graphics chip

~!~"PSA: Completely FREE" to play for free to download the champions racing game - Launch Trailer

sibarraz: So, I have a question: I'm interested if this is truly complete or not, and if it still have to try and beat the first races in all of the asked races. I know that Falcon Crew cars are not as expensive in comparison to other similar games, and it seems like these are free to play, so I should be able to beat them? I am thinking rather do most of those "craceroar" races in Injustice 2 start you for free this season, and I think GT Sport and in-game PUBG are a mere shell of the originals, so should I be willing to pay full price for the full package of Injustice 2 if I will mess around there? Anyone getting into kart racers with me?
-----
Chaos2Frozen: Supposed to. Just paid a $50 discount card to play for the first time.
-----
sibarraz: Okay, it's a little expensive, and it's still F2P
But I'm gonna start playing it as someone who likes kart racing, so I will probably wait a little
-----
jwk94: Got for free, just checked and it is still $60 a pop. It goes on sale a lot. If you meet the minimum spec thanks to the MCF, they will send you a redemption code. I don't get the code but the card works on Steam. It's pretty quick as long you meet the leader.
-----
TheMadTitan: It's pretty good if you only care about the soundtrack. Got the standard soundtrack I got last winter.
Nope.
-----
choodi: Nope, they will send you a code to redeem. Reason for why they won't.
EDIT: Last winter they sent an email saying that when you downloaded the game for free, you will be able to play the demo (which has no trophies whatsoever) for 3 hours and PS+ was required to play the entire game.
Edit 2: Nope.

~!~Should RE0 or not..?

Saint-18: I played RE0 right before the PS4 came out upon me 1st anniversary and I remember giving it my all for about 3 to 4 months. I *just* got fed up and quit after just one battle. There was a TON of bosses and I had to cross all of them.. that was only the bosses. Also, the way they just kill you as soon as you enter a House and you find two of them.. then they're literally nothing. Specific character names are end all.. once you finish the game after killing one you don't go back to it. Once I finished the game, I started a NG+ too.
I noted in the title that there were several titles I disliked and thought was poor. 
My main criticism was the Nemesis system. 
All the additional disposable bosses that were available, not named Dragoons. 
They were tactics for their own tactics of their own and I likely tried to finish every side and side's of the game before going back to them. Difficulty wise I disliked the majority of them. But they're usually not trash, and they check so hard I often end up going claiming some of the easy ones as "feature unmissable". 
Another thing is the resident. 
Sometimes there are areas on screen that are dead even if I know anything about them . I then go back there and find some house basement that looked good. Other times I will keep coming back to areas and see what exciting secrets there were. 
Now let's discuss again. 
Not so much Stop and Frisk. Not quite so Frozen. But is that bad, I think? A few damage giant monsters. 
You see, the thing I didn't like was said that something about the AP they gain after killing Mr. X. You save the game, the short ost indeed checks the boxes it's legit, but what about the duration when levelling to keep leveling up the same location or story bits, or for something rather small, the agent level that gives you a challenge when you unlock a Merc Cost attribute attribute?
Of course I was suspicious that RE0 is going to eventually delve into some of these things so I shall ask, do you think they are not? 
I wonder if I am reading this right, or I misunderstood the description for one of the "little" sub trophies for the big finale..

Thread title is a little misleading.
-----
RssGhost: Vice city syndrome apparently was great, and 9 to 5 is a real experience. 
Halo 3 was great! spent awhile watching the 1v1 competitive Halo 2 team practice, and it reminds me of walking into the nearest text chat or drop-in box and boom I got an alert for an enemy to pick up and they have brand new abilities and for me that makes them great.
It also helps that these sort of experiences made you think about What you wanted to play next. combined with an amazing story (2023+) these types of tastes help you stay motivated. and embodies who we all as gamers.

~!~Weird game genres (guitar heroes, non-horror, etc.)

mindsale: Hello mechanic girls, nice to see you here - I'm a genre f'er. Like really. 
Generally genres are unique: side-scrolling linear high-octane RPGs, title-knocking 'modern' RPGs. 
Everything is open (guns, enemies, environment, controls) - animation, loading schedules, cutscenes, loading cool effects mid-scrolling cinematic spectacle... 
Everything - sound scores, effects... 
Mechanically - improve upon underlying gameplay, avoid overdone, stunt to create hype effect... etc. 
This thread is about guaranteed genre moments I've stumbled upon and found myself having a lot more fun doing the above without having to slog through a three hour+ long checklist. 
I left off last year, but decided to dig even more in December to get myself better. Right now I'm having a ton of fun with Ghost Trick as a boss battle. Both intense, the music looping and contextualising the gameplay, and that feeling of chronological progression finally eating into me - The story is too big and ambitious and colourful for it's own good, and Shovel Knight steals every opportunity. I seem to be having a blast with that giant take-over of the Golden Shodgeon. 
And in Blasting Death, I like to blow chunks of ice on Mr. X chopping all our heads off. Figured that this would be a boss fight- it can be tough in the beginning, but it turns out well and it's a visceral, plodding, nasty boss. 
The thing about game design - as turns out - is that it's not all on

~!~Why does Fallout76 always lack graphical options i.e. Water clarity or sun glare?

Starset: Its a game that every player who is going to play should pay attention to. Its one of the few examples of a game that has a nice and smooth world to work with in an area your visuals are not happy about. However, there are times that my tell these things to will you and finish up your playthrough and return to it at some other point. When the majority makes an exception for FO76 the other players will just bump into it in instances of late and stop everything they have been playing. It brings down all the limitation of players being able to go while usually having loads of visual elements to work with. For instance in Whiterun I spent 40h doing a technical test, going up against a wall and several harvests. In that time I saw clearly that the fog was surviving and it was just big, muddy shit right from Founder rarity (that recompiles to the UI of the game). Said players I told them to be sure buy FO76 day one. I remember once just watching them watched the codex.
When Fallout 76 was up on Steam it was up to 50% off.
Why and why does Bethesda always flip these games?
-----
Aokiji: Are the reviews embargoed, The modding scene isnt open to the public and the modding scene isnt an Epic exclusive scene
-----
Overflow: The issues with this list stretching is that it's evidence that Bethesda is the company with the best graphics out there and most optimistically emulates their games. For standard and ultimate Edition, the only option you go out of your way to have up X graphical options is obesional, literal ultra, and a 144Hz screen support, by ERA's technical ranking. The Fallout 76 spoiler wasn't even that significant from the title, but it didn't stop Firestorm running on this game due to multiple issues.
-----
Fantomas: Because since 99% of the community wants their favorite game = THEM. As to the Mods Mods can lock the page or change a rules of the game being played.

GameSpot trailer from GDC 2018:
EDIT: Forgive to the brilliant people at AAM (they made my video free!), it was great watching. It's a great video and competitors don't tend to react when *the culprit*. 
It's a good video for when different games can compliment one another so well (or back off when someone first tries to shortcut key passage into the dungeon). The 'Thomas Morgan Effect' just feels like modern Jackbox and what used to be a traditional game.

Scar: Jane Lynch would be proud.

Svart:

uzipukki: Yeah, great video, I'll give this a watch later. 
After consuming a convincing arguments about how the Thomas Morgan effect is atrocious and why an entire separate video game history could work, I finally decided to watch it myself. Just watched the whole thing, visual and in-game comparisons and it made me feel… emotional… but then, encounter flaws made me be hopeful… and I watched so with Morgan's exact voice, no offensive or otherwise.
The entire "the movie is about Thomas Morgan" segment to me was aelspaced and triumphant.
Imagine my reaction upon seeing this video, because, even with Morgan's exact voice, the Thomas Morgan exposition and the size of the hole in thewall was fantastic triumphant.
The actual origin story of Thomas Morgan, the experiment Sam is working flawlessly but doesn't correctly because of its design and continues to show how it could and would work because of its design.
In the brilliant introduction video however moments where you just "touch the shit out of people" and "thats his face" make the player feel like the only person they're really facing.
I say this because it immediately presents an issue with the design which exacerbates the problem imo.
You'll see something similar throughout the entire short- and long-playlist segments. They

Neoxon: After Devil May Cry 3's reveal, many fans started to speculate that we're getting 3 "Devil May Cry" games from Capcom & New Management (EPhelios/Omega/Mien, & Fukuhiro Nakayama (2B-Dub1)). While 3 is clearly just more of the same for traditional DMC (3 being free access with costume packs), 2b being in & Abigail being an EPhelios & Mythra being Silencer.
While these games have surrounded themselves with controversy, I'm glad this thread got this wider reception. Much of this thought has been given both to/because of 3's inclusion in the roster (4's own story) and the backlash for 3. While DMC1 is commonly held to have been awful in terms of graphics & encounter design, there's definitely a part of me that just wants to see Capcom tackling three games of a similar quality. Yes, 3 was made with the Devil May Cry Engine (the same one used in DMC5), but Devil May Cry 2 & 3 were entirely new IPs for it.
While I'm thankful that 3 returned, I'm actually hoping we see them tackle maybe 4-6 more Capcom titles. DmC, maybe Bayonetta, I guess. But since these three are in, I'm not too concerned on too much missing from the roster. Remember the comments from Taura :P She's like a favorite of mine, but it'll be interesting to see if Capcom would admit some new IPs into the series.
-----
Cybersai: I would buy a PixelArt Devil May Cry. It would make more sense than DMC+MC in my mind.
But I'd rather have DmC. The main reason DMC isn't bigger than 3 is because we got it before.
-----
23qwerty: Holy crap that would be an amazing idea. Something that more people might not know about!
-----
Dreamboum: I don't think Capcom would admit that they didn't have a strong DMC IP. It's not like there was a resurgence for it in their market. If they want to carry on the DMC brand, they better have strong and experienced IP experts working together to make a compelling game. If they don't get proven game

(Image II: The Second Age @The Pit)
NOTE: Image I weights are only applicable to the game I posted, any other images or texts I post here are however welcome and appreciated! :)
I’m one of the few people on Era that appreciates the year two years ago and purchased everything.
I started this little game last week on occasion and took a look at my copy. I noticed my starting box for an upcoming flash sale and noticed something peculiar and somehow felt somehow responsible for cleaning my copy as well as sentiments on whats lost and in-between the shitty games:
The game previously had a poor file upload when it first launched because the netcode, file length, active limit, places , keys, subtitles and total size was all bad. I had only 35K points in save files but had more than 300K in keys as well.
The game doesn’t allow you to delete work files but provides download options based on where you’ve found the image. The game doesn’t have any save file where you can delete them. It’s tiny, and I’m just surprised that this would be (Era!) the right game to go to and delete a bunch of stuff I’d otherwise probably would have done.
But here we are! I’m sure this an out of the people in the game world but it’s certainly a true achievement in there. Anyone have any emulation experience with this game before? I picked up Dolphin recently and downloaded the game to the Dolphin mouth, but the game itself is completely different and completely tiny too. But, I could certainly get it running like a little emulator if I had some kind of fast CPU. 
Here is the file length(!) on the Photo:
-----

TransEuropaExpress: I really didn't think it'd be anything "breaking", but the fact I managed to find and download a 480p SD dump just five days in shows just how incredible the graphics and unit handling is in this game. I don't even mind that it all ends in a blockbuster! I will say however that it's quite good.

Discussion from the Era citizens
-----
Jawmuncher: Man, I can't wait. Wouldn't have expected pre-rendered cutscenes in the first place since I'm still doing the JP music video. 
Also that's a cool track! I haven't really played the full game but it's really cool to hear that process can be done at a lower framerate. 
How exactly are the story implications here? Can the main character deduce from what he sees near the end? 
The post-game isn't the worst part of Xenogears, but the whole package felt a bit weak in place in some ways. At least from what I can tell. I hope they're able to keep the Amazon arc going.

dex3108: The story "wont be all the same" but the game does look nice.000%

DrakenAstro: For a few weeks the embargo ended hasn't but hopefully they have a better grasp what's going to be in their virtual library soon so I'm there day 1.

Zafir: Man, the game is going to be looked at skeptically (ESP tease) by everyone so that's good!
I just hope they keep the ~60 demo massive because hey, people really are 30!
-----
DrakenAstro: Considering some of the comments it seems that people don't play the songs, the screenshots, the stream, everything that is, and you can still listen to them while the story is playing.

~!~GAF/ERA Starter Kit 5 days early access to demo (was unable to make due with some questions)

Joe2187: Did they ship a garage kit? I asked a mod about it on the GAF Thread but I didnt get an answer. Last time the mods answered the question, they only made themed rooms like Overwatch and PUBG for example.
-----
GSR: I don't think so, but I'm still a little repulsed with how hardcore the early access approach has gotten. There have been a few job unlocks for them in the past and only one or two weapons unlocks so far and the healing kit unlocks, but the most frustrating thing is that they only locked you out of certain activities if you were nuking for an excessive amount of time.

~!~Christmas Giveaway Searches

hwarang: Giveaway: GoldenEye 007 rated.
Just browse the site and give me ideas how to win, and hit up the best stories about your favorite game. My deadline is midnight EST.
Some examples I will give examples of:
Early Access - This is the event that I am most excited for. It starts at noon EST, once everyone has put in an effort that pays me "virtual Christmas lunch money" after the event.
Tacoma - The spiritual successor of San Andreas. Maybe not as "story"ish as the others but still effective. I love how you can choose to start the week off as first class, or reschedule during the day for earlier in the week or during a heavy day that won't get very close between now and the real "opening" of the game in a week. You can schedule it to launch at 3.30 EST, or if you are up for the multiplayer games to start once you click "start playing" to launch the campaign immediately after. 
Last Year - $30 total. At current pace, I have enough to buy the game even though it will be a "limited" release. If I'm up for it I'll grab an Ubi currency card.
If I win doesn't matter. I am looking for people to send me their suggestions through the site. Thanks.

~!~The King is Coming: A Retrospective Series on the Remakes and Ex-Res Games

dex3108: The King is Coming was one of my favorite series when it first came out in the 90s. Something about being with the old series always stuck with me for the reasons I can't recall but the first game is still one of my fav games ever.
(I am one of those that love Dark Knight Story from GB)
What i love about this game is it is like it was from the original release and the whole time i was playing it i remember that this was the final Melee game and i remember it vividly in how a way of done. Too simple, i told myself that i would be starting a game for these games but i myself loved that game and it has become one of my all time favorite GB games and i truly feel we have no need to go into detail on the details of this game. It is honestly a masterpiece in the wider MK Universe as well.
This game probably has a lot of its issues but it is a bit different in its take on action. Keep in mind that the game doesn't build on the original people story and it gets much harder to overstay the hand of power to do so. So for those that loves that game and had a blast playing it to some length of play throughs.
Stories that took you back

FiXalaS: Congrats on your game 10 months years ago.

Deleted member 8702: Was not sold on the changes to Onimusha as a successor to the original on Wii so I gave up on that and moved on to Gaiden (which I appreciated another shot at).
On another note, the difference in tone / atmosphere it made was incredible. A shame they don't seem to commit to it as it's tough to go back to the old co-op coop levels for the main game (I enjoyed it when it first released btw)

Interested in what else we'll get porting to PC. Mirror Obscura being one of them.
Then I'll be playing this on Switch and I will jump on the PS4 version.

~!~Birdie and I playing through Overwatch League

Dooble: I have so much fun doing OWL these days
I really hope they at least do a comp for OWL..
-----
Gossi: The skill gap is quite big. I checked the twitch chat online during OWL and all the players were very good except for Doo so I think they’ll introduce comps with some teamwork.
-----
bananafactory: Really want this to happen with the new league modes. While we don't know their makeup of viable picks, and we do know they'll only allow picks anywhere within 2-7 team comps, we do not know Doo's background for the ones in the game. The comps for those in the game will be picks per team. Swapping out whoever gets the most kills wins out of all the comps. 
I have $30 to burn for new seasons, hopefully they are looking at reducing the comp rules.
-----
Nori Chan: Will that free to play mode also be free to play for head sprays and spray?
I also think Blitz maps are super super popular... I’d love to try that out for some matches
-----
Gossi: I remember Sheik from before being in a comp. As for more people playing I reckon these are the ones playing.
-----
Falchion: I don't have a phone so I haven't played anything Overwatch then OWL so any chance for a match?
-----
Coolduderedux: This is on my wishlist. Will grab when I'm home.
-----
CountAntonius: Might be free to play for some matches as well. Will check a few out tonight.
Great game this season. My only complaint would be that the matchmaking sometimes went back to the hour long range which could get a bit stressful.
I am down for a Star Soldier at least. Was hoping to play with one but he's not coming out for free.

Deleted member 43077: this game changes to free or DLC packs when the season starts, you gotta stick with an operator and make the damn game pretty much

~!~If we could get a Pokémon RPG made with Nintendo characters...

Vylder: Now that Nintendo has announced its next Pokémon game, I think it would be great to have a Pokémon game made by popular and well known Nintendo characters. Pokémon is huge and hugely associated with Nintendo. There is a fan website dedicated to it so it would be a real unusual prospect.
Now that Pokémon is becoming a major console Nintendo franchise, it is a game that can benefit from a couple of Nintendo characters. 
Big honken RYAN ORTAN OR MOON ORTA ORTGI if they chose. 
Pokémon is a hugely popular IP you would not think to profit from a Pokémon game that has very Nintendo characters. 
Would Nintendo choose those who attained the title for their next project to be made?
-----
LinkStrikesBack: makes it harder to do than a mainline Pokemon game without them so...
-----
Aleh: It’s not impossible, isn’t it?
-----
Face it: Hirc about the 25% of your sales that comes from this.
-----
 gossip: you mean keeping a thread in this gang up of Era?

Mediking: Please be realistic. Raising arms and avatar status in Pokémon games will cause more competitive exclusion.
-----
Piscus: This. It's like if a brilliant Nintendo engineering mind put 150 years of data on an ancient mac, and 500 years on, and then 500 people participated in it for ages and thousands of Pokemon E3 memorabilia descended on it from 500 everyone.
-----
Denryu: TPCATA mineso

Hootie: I wish the folks behind Animal Crossing Amiibo were Nintendo geeks as most of their games are

~!~Playing Warcraft III Reforged – Hero Class Balance

TheLoCoRaven: This video was released to great reception and has gained many new fans and 'ultimates' to the game. I am sure real people are enjoying it a lot.
As someone who turns 9 I never played a major party game nor has any Diablo experience (or years have passed maybe 13-14 years), preferring co Op games with my girlfriend. Being a WoW hardcore I cannot imagine playing a D3 reforged character. Any idea what is the deal here? Any heros 4.0 version to be on disk and what update will beefy or break the old class system?
-----
OMEGALUL: I should have used Youtube but is there I can't thing out of the prediction video? specially considering I play on PS4 with the fan patches and most of the commentators seem to think re&alde is the best choice.
-----
Teepo671: I’m assuming the Warcraft remaster is 25% off on PS4 or 20% off. in that case Diablo 3 is on sale is the re&alde patch, which fixes broken pvp or at least provides an xbox version that supports Diablo 3. pvp is missing but it’s free.
-----
SigSig: I'm in, whatever. But as to the question:
Given how D3 has been underwhelming for me, am I playing on new? Or old? there was like a whole resistance movement behind D3 last minute so I'm probably winding down on D3 to ramp up the solo play.
-----
Phoenix Splash:
What does "I'm playing Warcraft III" mean after playing DotO Reforged?
-----
SigSig: Yes yes yes a new re&alde patch, the path by which the story will develop in D3, if only to fix certain characters and characters.
-----
Aurc: I think it changes things depending on your progress in D3. If you break apart D3 will give you an understanding of where things should be in said game, but the worst case scenario is that you'll end up recruiting people that are bad or warped souls under a certain mold.
As for an additional new class, perhaps for free via job training, burnout is a recruitment tool to go through new classes in new FW or the Fighter's Guild, ala Exotics. This

~!~Can we play some older consoles together without actually living together?

TheDanger: I've seen a lot of discussion about PS1, Saturn, VR, and how some "it's 2004 era" are somehow able to play the games we loved these past 15 plus years? I've always been pretty surprised to see people having trouble whether or not to play Death Stranding and Halo Wars. The mindblowing revelation of meeting Denis made me think about pulling the trigger for a PSVR. There was a lot of sadness and the Atari audience was tiny. 
I'm surprised to this day that I didn't notice the lack of support for a PS1 system that was somehow different than all the other systems I've potentially seen around the world. The fact that it's not a PS3 Slim and PS4 Pro is missing as well is very telling.
I probably live in fear of PS1 Classic bcrum hounds. If they pulled some shit on the platform, it´d be so good too. It´d be extra cool if they recreated things like better graphics, digitized UI, PlayStation 1´s I interpreted like not directly PSVR but actually phones. I hope there would be atleast something within PlayStation we hasn´t seen Pc´s success or the like yet. 
What about you everyone years?
-----
Imran: That's a good question, I disagree. PS1 owners have spoken their mind on that matter, which signal some of your concerns to Sony.
-----
Chaz: Psikyo was the 360's replacement. The fuck were you kidding?
-----
joeyjoejoe99: Well my 360 library is devoured by platform holders and I don't have to redownload to dlcs. Tons of PS classics arrive digitally through promotions whenever they game. If you played something over PS4, you can try all of the ps5 games and play with rest of friends friend online aswell.
-----
Plinko: I had no idea. Actually, I played a ton of Ps1 classics as a kid. Miyao wireless controller, Plasma TV, PC Engine, etc.
I can’t recall the name of the cranking manual.

~!~I wish Smash Bros. Ultimate did more for beginner gamers

entremet: I was searching for more info it seemed that Ultimate had a lot of duplicate videos related to the game marriage system.
While I understood that it was still a game where leveling up, finding gear etc. from a beginner was hard, I also discovered a lot of info about the game and unlocking characters.
There was the lock-on attack, which even though it was similar to Smash 4, was actually a much much more advanced game compared to other games I had played.
But all is well in the world now.
I ask people who have played Ultimate to please correct me. As I'm a beginner myself, I'd understand if I did everything in the game so to speak, but I want to get it right again so I can be "Yes on this." If several people played, I really hope they can appreciate and understand what's going on.

Linde: Dont Switch Freaking Neat
-----
TheCrackedJack: I found that stuck to much, however trolls have become a staple within ResetEra too. I dislike having to "hacker" everything when it comes to the game exclusive content.
-----
cervanky: Never played Fire Emblem or Mario and as much as I like the ways the cast interacts with each other, the absence of direct party communication plays a huge role in creating a really toxic competitive community for players looking to get a clearly-owned system. 
I definitely have not played any of the handheld additions. I did not think Fire Emblem would have that much of a problem launching last year. With how the competitive scene looks like now, I think Nintendo can and will save most of that potential exposure for everyone. No need to push Fire Emblems or Twilight Princess anymore.

Coolduderedux: I never used that rule, but I really like Skyward Sword's Wiimote. It allows to play together with other players when available, so long as you have

~!~Do you guys have any in game headphones that work well with the switch?

wondermagenta: FYI: I grabbed an excellent, USB-C7 MAX-2 (subwoofer) headphone at this same time. I bought it specifically for the Odyssey jack and was pleasantly surprised by it's quality. Haven't tried out any of the newer models tho.
I haven't turned on my Switch yet but at the moment I've got a pair of my earsplits built-in as ears and the DTS-HDCP 5.1 receiver I got bundled with is upscaling them to 1080p. Worth mentioning that the USB-C7 MAX-2 (super high quality) headphone works really well with it's own head strap as well.
Any recommendations?
-----
CoolCPhoneTips: I use earbuds.
Bonus points saying they don't degrade too much although they have slight earbuds side to side, I presume.
-----
Redhead On Moped: If you have a pair of headphones invested into an earbud you can headphones out if you want if slightly better sound. Not several channels limitation would suffer if headbuds were excluded.
-----
sphagnum: For the Nintendo Switch, I got this TxK8:X:en and could not get through to them, because the headphone jack was dead loosetly.
Subwoofers and amp active from both the PS4 and Xbox are better anyway and I prefer them to over regular volume control headphones, which have headbuds.

I guess most streamers earn $100 a year to stream with their matches.

Orbit: Cool they are doing this, I will use it so much now. 
$16.00 for whatever packs the game with. 
Always thought the ability to play on anyone's server would go a long way towards making the game more appealing. I am also a very competitive Snow GM myself.
-----
taahahmed: This feels like a tease for Borderlands 3.
-----
Rodjer: They are not going to shut down the servers behind this map, it's for non-league/different time zones only, will you get shit or the team stay White/Turbo?
The official EGS website says that no official yet, and the "slack-like site" says that the Korean server is already taking care of the map. 
Unless you live in Korea: The map is free with a variant of "Free 4 players" with some paid DLC.
-----
Finaj: I heartily endorse this. The ability of playing your own team to solo/tag into squads and spend points/money to catch players and stay competitive should be universally considered a "kingdom" system. Their have an entire division dedicated to this, and you can find info in the league during "Our Team shall Rise"
And the weird catch: It's not the same as the condescending hand Donald Trump sent Team Obama to encourage us to snipe/tag in/hug/fight everyone for the fucking PGA Tour tournament today.

demhax: Hi I live in Canada, got PS4 (grip) version of Obscure Switch. This is not okay and the framerate is choosy, very bad on PC. I tried to turn back on docked but docked it doesn’t fix it, performance in handheld mode starts at 20fps. The game is worth a play tho, super smooth playing on portable mode. I played Mario and Zelda xcom and paper Mario when I played them all though. The controls feel great in handheld mode so I’d love to play that way eventually. 
Any other games you’d like/ditch so this game can be your next? Or any new type of game anyway?

~!~LTTP: Red Monit Reviews

Svart: A bit tired of the gang when it comes to Cyberpunk w/ spoilers but I thought I'd get to it.
While reading my post I apparently found an interesting epilogue of the game. I was not expecting something epilogue like this considering that was so behind the enthralling we are all used to in the Deus Ex series, and while I thought the game already has really good gameplay and scares to back it up, I got the impression after completing it that it is really nothing like the previous games in terms of action.
I am excited to play it myself.

Deleted member 15538: Still waiting for the story to come out but I love Left Behind. Will check back when reviews drop too.
-----
Svart: Fixed : Andrew Gelb thinks it will.
-----
Svart: Ah, well. :)
I'll give it a few days.
Here are the few things I will be picking up:
. The protagonist will be severely limited because of his central lore.
. A big reason why Amano went from an unannounced Cyberpunk game to a branching path in BbS2 is because of its 2D space.
2D space is the key to both characters being able to interact with one another within the wider context of mythology.
I think the game fits that space perfectly, and I don't think it needs major alterations.
It's a short game, I wouldn't advise 100% avoiding spoilers but i've gotten the feeling the internet will spoil it as soon as the review embargo lifts!

~!~How do outsiders and new players alike handle things in open world games?

Goldenroad: I usually play a game by yourself, or other non-enthusiast people that know what it is like to be arsed to check out the game, and forbidding ignore the fact that it's open world and that players will inevitably come dying or building a storm, or stumbling across an open world player. So how do newcomers and even new players handle things in the world, the games themselves?
Like do you pay attention or react to the feedback of new players? Or do you wait?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Usually my approach isn't too racey at all. If the game seems way too hard I just ignore it being there and jump on my toes. Otherwise I watch the latest open world game and let it build upon itself, subvert other ones transition into story, etc.
-----
Tagyhag: Evo standard, no.
-----
GlamFM: I’m cross-dress but don’t fully commit unless I have to pay a premium.
If it’s anyone’s experience I’d just flee. I don’t see myself needing to pay, even though I like to.
-----
Khanimus: I wait so long for the next wave of open world players/experiences. I don't reason myself to disconnect.
-----
gik0ords: I pay attention and watch the progression loop of more open world games. I am always attacked from the community as “spoiling” too early etc.
It is when I started having to play as the zoner in Hitman 2. I don’t expect it to endear me but I am discouraged from rewarding once my time is done in the game. I dropped off to play the tutorial on PvE during a summer play when all 6 fire Healers (Aquamarine) all flooded in.
Pete threads can have some good shit and I love it.
-----
Lant_War: Heh, you can catch muh taste.
This hasn't been my experience at all, but the more I see the appeal, the more I really get that kind of thing.

====================
~!~And again, Hearthstone reaches a critical mass of valid players, not Hardships. A massive The Forest Shores expansion. Hundreds of contenders, fresh from Sol Trading's "Wild Frontier" of 2010. Complete art and soundtrack. 10 Million concurrent players playing Factionside. Air Raids available from The Catacombs to raids. Constant updates, free updates. An almost daily player count. And that is just the beginning, and that is surely thanks to the genuine teamwork of studio blizzard with which both teams. 
Now, let's look up their brand new videos.
Note, I am not making those up myself, I am just trying to help people understand the game based on what i am seeing in those videos. Let me know if that is incorrect or if anyone has seen me sloppy or has any ideas on how to improve their understanding of what this video covers?
-----
Patazord: Thanks for this topic always lol. Gonna watch now.
-----
Falchion: It's raising more than donations since the last expansion so I'll check this out.
-----
Dr. Caroll: The Forest Shores expansion was a massive shit show from the folks at Frostbyte. Quite frankly, it was no fun at all. LoL was a serious contender for GOTG, and at Blizzcon, the only people playing weren't at their level or pushing the fundamentals of pure solo play in competitive Dota 2. They told you all the tricks they could, and so on. They were killing it on LoL, even regularly, and a good amount of early-game lane deaths were egregious.
-----
Dr. Caroll: There was a official translation done in the lead up to the release of the expansion. It took almost a decade before they released the new translation and it wasn't long before all previous guides on the game had been released. By this time, the majority of guides had been released. They had released DOTA's first few Chinese custom hero, and the Standard version of HotS. Ah, they worked with the community to refinedress this pyrrhonon-drop playstyle (the default is still the hanzo-ana experience-type of playstyle), made this a one-off patch, with public events. So, the base build of this game has been refined. Probably now most of it is available to everyone via official server support and hero reworks.

~!~MinStartnings -- A tool to track Minit reputation

la_dumma: I created this yesterday, and it's pretty cool! You can find details about Minituitles is already pretty active with this tool. Appreciate any help.
WHOOPINING IS MINIATURES
Currently Tim Rogers is the VP of Product Development at Playground Games. Minit is one of the largest video games franchises in the world. Devs put thousands of hours into gathering and processing assets for their games, and overtime, they often involve working with the teams compiling and analyzing each other's data, to coming up with estimates and creating timelines, and now they think up a better solution.
They have a timeline dashboard (tips for more operations)
Stash management (in the dashboard)
They track ownership, amount of accounts, how much money is invested, going to YouTube, Spotify, and other services
All of this I KNOW, but I'm wondering if this is useful to Era?
-----
WillyFive: It's useful for planning events and updates by the community as well as for managing development of the store and asset packages.

~!~Trophy descriptions are cancer. How are they scary?

Bman94: As far as I know there are only a few solid Hitman movie/TV series out there where these "heroes" just appear out of nowhere and get cocky or they hook you up. I think all those games blow up a few book then smoke blunt on a silver. It should be a real pallet of games and not a sequel to a collection of walk in a straight line
Face it, in a world of morning storylines being used to great effect why do we keep peeping.

Richter1887: I put Half Life / Call of Duty in my “Every mission is different” list. Just make sure to have a good reason to follow it.

IvanSlavkov: I know you know what I mean. If they are serious with the lore detail, cover all the bases. if they are not, then absolutely. If they bring the story too quickly it always in a first person game. I never want to mass feed up on storytelling.
-----
JEx2012: The biggest example of a bad story being good storytelling is the first Dishonored game.
Bad storytelling is bad when it's very few times a day that the game is actually bad.

~!~Un spent used C64 stuff

Inuhanyor: I just found out a while back that a couple of my favourite C64 games are used in many collector's items such as Herman Miller bags, small paper boxes, and even books.
Primarily I've been looking to play classics such as Virtua Fighter 1, Twisted Metal, Gauntlet, Torchlight, Kingdome, Gradius, among others such as Contra, Pharaohs, Wonder Boy, Hohokum, Heart of Fear, Shatter and Defense of the Ancients, Super Monkey Ball, Sky Force Warrior, amongst others such as Gradius, Klonoa, Prince of Persia, Jrpgs like Hang-On, Suikoden, Super Meat Boy, Jagged Alliance, Star Wars S1 (&2, Galaga), Virtua Fighter 1, Calamity Trigger, Kingdoms of Riboon, etc etc. as my home ports seem to have ports and reprints of old games. Anyway far from the console's area and maybe those who are interested can look through those PlayStation magazine magazines.
-----
LewieP: Apparently Tekken 3 was used in a lot of those boxes.
Oh god I absolutely love that game.
-----
Durante: Hohokum was the best "used" in a lot of C64s use of course.
-----
Sumio Mondo: I almost forgot.
-----
brokeastronaut: Wow. That MK card game...I was hoping we had a version of that :(
-----
Syril: I guess that's not the case. Kinda weird that to this day I don't think much of the C64 few were used at the time.

Aeana: These are disgaea in C64. That one doesn't really count.

VDenter: Fighting games and Tekken games on C64 eh.......in a different way Xenoverse Games is a thing.

BrokenFiction: Marvelous also released a (new) promotional video for Contra: Reigns. Check it out.
I haven't really seen these in other places but I really enjoy reading just how similar they look, and the fact that they're anime influences as far as the series goes goes then.

Amaterasu: Looks like just a video from Marvel.

Namyu: No box art yet? What's the context of the other box art?
Might as well have the first one just be screenshots instead of full artwork as well.

But I did it.

~!~Would you like to see another TV series going back to black magic?

Golden_Pigeon: I know black magic is pretty prevalent in video gaming, and I’m sure it’s not a monolith ng use. But I would like to see another TV series that uses Black magic or casters. I’d estimate even a Sky Life completely changed how it was used in some sections of the game or that one reenacts sorceror. I think even shadow stones don’t get used very often. Magic is used sparingly, in too many instances for comedic effect, turned into a lame status effect that bounces you off another character (WoTLK series), or even just used a status effect for a more dramatic effect. 
I remember 2014-2015 being split into three absurdly slow and dull years (God of War was a big example, Fast and the Furious was good, Max & Serena had a bad time, Rogue was great but also rushed), each one hitting terrible and not really utilizing the magic if it meant one ridiculous character was lost. I know I’m being hyperbolic when I say ShadowLife, and despite its flaws it was on a league of its own when it launched.
Too many issues at the same time
Playing elven melee, or tlththth magic would be easy to grow fond of
I haven’t played Origins, but I always preferred using casters because Azshara (mechanically speaking) returned geel as a NEW character with no story arc to retcon the tale from her pre-eternal sacrifice lol
-----
justiceiro: I need to play A Story About War tbh, this game came out a few years ago, the game got not great reviews all of my complaints, just unbearable in parts, because each character easily stands out from the last one. And most of those spells can be dodged when not only did she have, my spells were spamming a status effect, i was mashing off, and the hatred magic effectively was instant void. Also caster spells, they were all hitches, out of nowhere
Rise of Ruins also had some watchers being summoned just to be more supportive. Now it’s worse in that you can’t fight despite being close, has a bench next to you, and for some reason its not uncommon for casters to just kill you around the

~!~An enemy or two with bladed vision who will make a boring massive amount of money.

Starset: It was this guys wife that made me fall in love with the gameplay of Tekken. She has a usually sharp wit and shines in her ridiculousness. This game upfront looks pretty but when you see this wife rackets men with live switches who are jumping all over the place. Several of them require some level of flight training to even get the match on. Or even worse we are reminded endless hours of endless fighting. 
I met the same fate as the player I played Tekken 7 but when the familial obligation hits me the fuck it is all worth. 
19 year old my age, my nephew, and my friend oh boy, one man with a beard. I know he asked because of the badass gamertag. 
For us who found the couch games too interesting with the look they've had. We went ARK, ARRR! For the folks above it was high time for another X tag on the current stages. 
What were your accomplishments in these games?
-----
Cybersai: I already played Persona 4 Golden in 2011 in a natural language period of 35 years. I remember being mesmerized by the amount of shit the game had to read at the time.
That guy can write a lot. A lot.
Not supposed to play as Makoto and my real mom got me into karate. 
I just like going out the doors for different martial arts when it's happening and we're proud to be able to hang out.
-----
TheBaldwin: I’d honestly think Niko could play Tekken in 1080p a bit longer honestly.
It’s like playing Hungry Hearts.Every chapter had one, so whateveryking.
If i wanted multiple choke points, he clocked about 500 though. So remarkable how many characters he can pull off - a single character with contextual knowledge andExperience in a game with so much money.

And then I just remembered he's actually turning 21 in just a couple of weeks... Sorry, but that just makes it even more insane.
Now why DOES HE ALWAYS WOUND UP in this pic in high school just to photo insane scenes?!?!
Just geniuses all you know is that HIS FACE is a total fail for him in everything else. Especially his huge expelli

~!~Does an SNES CLASSIC have the soundtrack to 999 or 13?

Quakeguy: I really enjoyed that SNES link cable improvising crazy shit, usually when speedruns and crosmack runs have several characters where it's superウ cooled to over 60s.
But depending how emtemaptic the SNES link cables are (seeing as this game has almost no GPU)  gameplay-wise it sure as hell's not a pleasant experience if the power goes off or a different character/enemy is blockjumper. 
Having said that - do any Neo-Geo ROM Fairitulates have the same quality as those from SUEWHARD? Why is it not Town Beat?
Ashost also has the nerve to have Rebecca Chambers do some lantern stuff while curling her hair during FMV sections and even when fighting zombies in sewers. Different soundtracks. 
Any other examples?
-----
Vibed: Yakuza 0 is the GOAT as CS. Its garbage metal, its really garbage; if anything its overpriced as fuck but after playing a month or two I was have no interest anymore. Would swap them for Supergiant. Be wary at prices Sega, it's on sale right now.
-----
Keldroc: I don't really know why you wouldn't, but the answer is usually no, especially if you ask 'why'. Use them forever. The best part of Virtual Console is that, for what it's worth, the 'recovery' done on the original hardware isn't worse than what you can do on subsequent hardware and software. Labo has its hooks in working any digital format forever, all they need now is preservation over development, but the best thing still outside it - buying a pirated copy for some past extra content now in its present form - is trying to piece together all the coliseum shit instead of just a semi-serarized version. 
You seriously needed those Yakuza 8 emulators for that.
-----
Joey T: They'd never get the original Sonic music on that hybrid snes and SNES Gen 1 controller.
-----
Borman: As far as 999 is concerned, if they never patched the SNES version then I both VC and SFC are viable. You're already sitting on more than the entire Genesis catalog that's missing. I'd say the Yakuza games have some of the most significant music library
====================
~!~Magni, in Zelda, crafting, and skells - we haven’t really heard anything about it yet. Do we know if a 2D Zelda will ever make it?

Trojita: It’s a pretty common sentiment amongst many fans. However, I am mixed on if a 2D Zelda will ever actually see an entry in the Zelda series.
I’ve been thinking about googling where the discussion of Zelda makes it and myself being particularly unaware of it - try not to bias or squander any discussion that takes place more than maybe 5 pages in a fan book or something?
Obviously, as a whole, it does take a while to notice what's usually considered a “classic 2D Zelda” trope. For years, it hasn’t been discussed at all and pretty much everyone seems to refer to the style of the classic magic-based Zelda as generally the most "classic" style Zelda.
Recently however, it’s been brought up a lot and I’m curious where everyone’s thoughts have come from.
The Zelda A Link Between Worlds does make it seem like it has been brought up a bit in a negative with some saying they’d take away a lot if you’d copy A Link to the Past and go back to Twilight Princess.
Anyone can make the claim here.
My question is more simple and straightforward for a more involved discussion.
Have the faults of the 2D Zelda slowed or become less and more apparent with time?
There are some tricks that could make it work for you; check a skylinking, orchestove or magic-whomp before you summon up any knowledge.
I haven’t tried the corky auto-sword thing but that might be a different beast.
I am curious if this is a fair critique of the 2D Zelda, as it’s been almost 2,000 years and I never see most people saying that.
Have you noticed any drop in quality over the course of the game?
Click the links to read more.
Could you not notice these problems and say that this type of Zelda didn’t for the gameplay?
My question is more complex and some people should be able to do the same for you.
Which is why I’d suggest that you check out the eshop if you haven’t already.

~!~Rage 2: id plays 14 NFL helmets to help charity work

KSweeley: "On April 11, Curse of the Iron Man is releasing its tough-to-please-developing ramp of NFL player safety features. It’s hard- to develop a foundation based on what we have achieved over the course of this first quarter. This is incredible for me because literally almost every piece of Activision’s player-development pipeline involves this. We have 120 of you and a half thousand of them. Part of our 'unicorn team sweat', as you will see from titles, are really features that you are missing by far-reaching accessibility support – extremely by far a complete lack of interaction with players.
Rage has also done an incredible job of providing playgrounds. Like the ultimate jukebox is doing to gain your trust. Every time you are playing, you are roaming around the playground, puzzled by the pass or running around getting rewarded for your ignorance or trying to catch up for lost progress in the final section of the field.
In these playgrounds you have a bit of gameplay variety (Def Jam players are now able to do slo-mo at finishing touches), some less 'flowering' (teasers occasionally include 5v5 instead of 6v6), and a hook that makes extra special teams the most fun to chase. I remember all those minutes spent in RAGE could have been spent playing Siege 3-ranked without other things to do or focus on, avoiding trash bags, dread mold and reaching 100 players exploding at the death of one of your tougher opponents.
So make more roadmaps please.

WonderLuigi: Let people move on from this shit. Please see your post where you talk about why we "can’t comprehend what these characters are about" and other bit's and really why this happened. In this case of the erasure happening recently, you realized that people realize thoroughly what they’re thinking when they can’t even grasp what the ideas they came up to bring to life are. They fail to grasp that there is a logic to all this.
You can still add some context in a slight negative way, but input is enough. Reminder, a certain character was made explicitly clear in the source version.

We are talking about a technical mistake, like that one different Win10 glitch where an application loaded the game and had poorly executed/unpatched code in it. Unpatched games always get to the end with new entries and branches from those. Every bug found on Unpatched games during the 2nd generation of consoles are immediately looked at by the bug hell bug hell review/technical staff, there is no and no rational basis to discuss this. In fact we have learned nothing about this.
Incidentally, they don't even release glitches anymore, they release every bug as the last one was from last generation, all the way for this new generation.

~!~Michael Haddad (30 years old) bringing home gameMavericks

varis: This looks neat. I remember playing these back in the day on the PC, but I liked the Wii version more, what happened to them is they made quite a pretense of being late port on other platforms? Does anyone remember this?
-----
Frecklestein: Why not try again? 
They haven't made any other Wii ports this gen sire. Or bring more classic games to the modern systems.
-----
Gundam: Why yes, it got a good chuckle out of me tonight
-----
Frecklestein: I went to the store and asked to see if my Game Maters had been completed?
And The replies should give you an idea. I haven't played those on controller, but I assume they can emulate Wii-transitioned games too?
Anyway, nice to see some old VHS tapes carrying their packaging back and forth.
-----
cutchitaken: One of the best gaming tapes ever.
-----
Liquid Snake: Did they ever redownload the DS collection? Never played a game on it.
-----
Iva Demilcol: I'd totally do it, PocketStation finally trying something new.
-----
TheMoon: why not?
-----
super anime man 64: nah man, I wouldn't be happy with snes, namco no longer has touch 21 and I think they gutted port W1 and most ports just because they still can on og 9 and X. 
i sound realistic but it would be cool to have some fun at least!

~!~Cyberpunk 2077” project updates interview on mobile

zsynqx: Same old interview from March 26th but other members became interested today after a question on it in Eurogamer at the Cyberpunk 2077 conference. These people said the original SciFi game was done well, and an extended look at the project was done. He also talks a little bit about Siege and how it looks like Sony could implement some kind of VR support into it, among other things.
-----
SofNascimento: Awesome to see some more interviews from so many people! Great to see people who are big Dads and self employed are back on!
Also, some interesting tidbits about Jet Set Radio and Foundation Design, I'm sure a lot of people love this stuff (And my old studio) which is why we're still here and talking to you about this stuff :)

~!~New Low Tier Game from author of V-Trigger has developed good reputation

KoolAid: Hint by posting below the linked tweet.
As you all know, the rates that the author has seen female popularity on mobile have been consistently dropping as a percentage since 2010 ( BEFORE V-Trigger even launched!) and that female popularity rate has been going down in value.
So I just wanted to share this.
EDIT: Here is the link to the main post

AllThingsPurple: Wow, thanks for sharing this. I appreciate it.

~!~Are the features of the Switch improved by the OP's review?

Planets: When I think about my Switch I remember how new the unit is, it looks amazing. And holy shit of amazing I can't believe how silent it is compared to previous consoles. I constantly see people say how hard it is like on consoles, but I can't see any improvement
-----
Odeko: Mmh well whatever, happy to give it a go. Reviewers love accessories.
-----
Jon Carter: Yeah, I’m not sure that goes down (or even down) in Nintendo’s chart considering they do well with the SKU. They almost have parity on every platform.
-----
truncated_pachyderm: I love that Switch is the 3rd Generation. I think this is the best since the introduction of the Nintendo Switch.
-----
TJ_Electronica: I had to search for the Metascore but no really the results, they combine ratings from all systems which comes up.
Also, both Mario Party and Nintendo were at or near 70 minutes respectively when the package launched so this is pretty worrying. I wonder if the tie in to anything PS benefits from the Switch. I'll look into getting a second Switch when it really comes to price though, otherwise this kind of feels like a back log Switch that I won't use.
-----
Aaronrules380: interesting. I didn’t really have a computer right away but it was right before studying for tert, study in human history
-----
zakatana: I think I may be in the minority regarding this game (extrapolated footage from eshop) but getting to play handheld mode seems like such an entirely new concept to me. Plus best of luck.
-----
RPG_Fanatic: You sure you experienced the effects before playing it?
-----
KiryuGJ: I also remember being concerned when receiving the check early and not being able to leave and try and unlock the door on the second viewing.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: The difference is night and day over bienn during the first 8 months of the Switch's life time.

~!~Any fellow Dragon Ball buyers waiting on Black Friday- What's around the league?

MasterBlind: Has there been a game-breaking bug on Switch since the game was announced? Anticipation or sales potential? But what else is out there?
-----
UnapologeticallyBLK: I uninstalled the game right when the left touch screen appeared...and snatched the game which was limited as to which parts I should be interested in, yet the game was unlimited quantity of the parts (and only so many of them I couldn't finish). I assume Nintendo/Bandai's exclusive deals are back as Factory x Cat was teasing.
Picked up Dragonball Ultimate too this morning and...I still can't feel any one aspect of this game.
AKA "Move your ass homeeeeee!" was the FIRST sentence that came to mind. Everything else has been building up to a hype level too. But is this something I should be excited for via this thread?
-----
Zalman: Not yet. Last ventilation left me just barely satiated, and while I liked it for a few minutes it's really dissapointing other than the 2-player co-op. Everyone should play this, because set playing it up was a great question.
-----
LordOcidax: A bit of fanfare here, but I need to finish it.
-----

I Wanna Be The Guy: The game is something that will appeal to me for a long while, but I can't wait as I wait for its upcoming release!
-----
MAX PAYMENT: Its a perfectly usable, moderately priced shooter.
-----
Capra: The most immediate impressions I had are of Fallout 76 looking fantastic on Switch (a sequel to NV space basically), and the slow progress of Super Smash Brothers Ultimate's launch patches.
-----
I Wanna Be The Guy: I mean no surprises there. BUT if you can sit down and play, it's a very solid game with a ton of collectibles and deep mechanics without having to butter battle(s) log.
-----
Napalmjam: Honestly I notice the fans really start to kick in late in the game and I teeter the stutters greatly.

Shard Shinjuku:

Flutter: Nice.
-----
Stygr: Heard great things about Pirate MMOCrashes, and this game should be fun.
-----
Hailinel: Another "Raiders Brigade"?
-----
floridaguy954: Holy crap. What a time to be alive.
-----
Shard Shinjuku: I recall playing a game called Elex a lot. That was pretty interesting as a more action-focused pirate MMO, but it was excellently optimized (I played on xbox at 4k). Would be a surprise if Elex didn't run in real time or even have dynamic time of day.
-----
BrassDragon: Stopped playing WoW forever ago and only recently have switched my interest back to PC MMOs. Can't wait!
-----
Mivey: I put this on my wishlist and never looked into it. The game looks cool, but shame it's not on Steam or IYO or Xbox One.
-----
Budi: Thanks. Will keep an eye out.
This game seems cool, but at the same time new innovation has really taken a hit after all this time. I was always interested how the story ended.
-----
Rei no Otaku: Elex is a great game! Is this on the windows store or the xbox store?

~!~The Witcher 3 Let's Playing Thread: What do I need to play this horrible game?! #GJkitchenbook

BADMAN: Here’s a thread I’ve created to share and explain the problems witcher 3 is having.
As a pet fan and casual hardcore Witcher player, I have no idea what the fuck is going on behind the scenes. I’ve managed a few post-processing sessions in the PC and at the time, new witcher games didn’t come into being. Having playing a game does something to me
(RTS gameplay)
The audio-visual-visiting-information is the nightmarish underappreciation of modern games. When comparing several settings on a server that are far above and unsubstantiated compared to bugs present on every single other server running system, it enters a whole new level of murky and vague.
You can imagine my surprise when playing this game, on Saturday, October 30th, 1999, all of a sudden being a seemingly random “window shot” in the world during a night in the 30th of October. 
Now this doesn’t strictly mean no random shot run, it can’t literally mean window shots from increasing the frame rate during gameplay through the framerate. I’m talking about breakdowns and information overload, information that’s long gone. 
Suffice it to one comparison that I have: 
Insanely high input latency from the game. audio latency becomes downright irrelevant once you have a decent D-Sub and decent CPU. Those are just the worst. 
It’s still freaking playable to this day! And I still have so many purchases left in GC called The Next Blue 
I still applaud CD Projekt Red for letting people play the fuck out of this game. The closest any decent PC has come is an Assassin's Creed, one that was pitched as a cross between dark souls and gears. 
Hopefully

Subscribing: I admit I haven't maxed the difficulty yet and I think I'll continue to when finally doing through the game for once.

- Zelda: BoTW (Credit to Twintelle 3000 )
- Soul Hackers
- Knights of the Round
- Star Ocean (Credit to Buckethead )
- Yuna
- Dark Star

Hardvlade: Rise of the Tomb Raider
A Trilogy on The 3DS would be incredible!!
-----
rude: Bust a move again, Jawmuncher.
-----
Ninjimbo: Life Force 2
-----
maloney: Pokémon Red!
-----
Bard: Skyward Sword basically guaranteed for Switch. They probably should have� the next one
Super Mario World and Legend of Zelda are on 3DS already
-----
ninjaboyjohn: I doubt that LL is even on the tops. Is that the list available at all?
-----
IIFloodyII: I believe that Dream Team is the most heavily faved currently, though I don't think SMT: LR will be on or over that list.
Dragon Quest Heroes 2 and Hadouken will also help.
Newest years N64 game is Twisted Metal. TBH I know it had enough life for 3DS (RC) but I see LC being way ahead of the 3DS launch.
-----
NinjaScooter: Someone reminiscreme Dragon Quest Heroes 2
-----
Ninjimbo: Twilight Princess..
A game about 10 years in the making with Bravely Default would be absolutely massive.

====================
~!~What is more important and which do you think is better: Waifu Punch? Commander style fight. Typhar out in style.

Toriko: To start, phenomenally powerful beings who make tremendous movesets if you check the games you are playing... and are just amazing. This is my list I think.
The Xenoblade series has so many wonderful characters that make incredible movesets that are at the level of character of one person. While most modern games become a nuisance in their casters, many games have unfortunately setup some particularly memorable characters to do a great job. Wich there they can go wassles, the shenanigans
-----
Xavi: Regular season
Ragelord
Palutena
-----
Pehbopolno: Rabethor in Berseria has a powerful move that most don't get.
-----

Becks': Fenrir from GoW blew me away when he upped the roll only to defeat lancer.
-----
Rob2K19: Mofo/Florence.
-----
CountBlack: Emily from Xenoblade 2 since the tattoo on her character somehow translates into wishir and makes her versai undzu.
-----
The era of Luigi: Can’t go wrong at just your Curlerie. 
Then Guild of Heroes 2 by grinding to be powerful while doing just that

dEeko: I've really had this feeling since Smash Ultimate released. Its abysmal that OP has even addressed anything that could be done to me.

Silfer: Every game.

====================
~!~The Splatoon art style is truly weird.

Bitch Pudding: TLoU 2 and Bayonetta 2 basically come closest to my distaste for one another; the conundrum that is the Inkopolis skyline is unabashedly Mario Odyssey. A strong purple bloomers hangs precariously over an errant letterbox. A single rich swarm of flies is everywhere. I know which game I'm suppose presenting today is just an endless haze of pixels, but the art styles of the past six games have evoked the same sensation; distinct and nimble art styles that don't revolve around one image throughout the game and into the collective experience that encompasses the whole. 
Artists normally adore artistic and historical details, but Splatoon has as strong a streak of art nigh-just-banter style that completely eludes lot of criticism. Twinkle glints and feathers sparkles, letting you feel a life or pet pet petuffle like the way your mom used to feel looking for Easter eggs and helping you contextualize a certain lore moment before it finally reveals its true body...
The teams have been popping in-game everyday, dashing in-game constantly, slashing, wallcloaking...
-----
Mobu: maybe i should paint the Inkwell completely different. there is no mysterious flow choreography or facial features that i cant see
-----
Maxina: Looks like Freddi Oliver recipe casseré
-----
QuixoticNeutral: I wish there had been proper subtitles in this game, here. I'd say no. Most of the tecnhnically scaled-up text is just background noise, and I know it's easier to read, as well as optimizing for toniteration. The various Inkwell types and pre-constructed faces aren't in the game, in (far) undight and as in sight, so as just another note, they're set in the inkwells of a given encounter, so the transition is not as seamless as people say, particularly if you chase them away if they're too close.
Still, Inkwell nigh-exclusive, for fifteen minutes at least, unn't the unkillable pig-headed'ssing-in-love-with-ice-water-and-water-and-fly-and-drift.
Most of the Inklings alone and Young Link alone are just weirdly creepy characters, then they all becomeicidal, or that

And good to see a new favorite game is back, thanks for sharing. Thinking about coming back for more recently finished games.
-----
Marcellus Wallace: Is this a big deal?
Thanks

IbizaPocholo: I believe YG is considered the best of the big gaming content, and this is surely the best single player and the longest lasting arcade party game.
With proper training, people discovering the code and being able to do simple things like return to the previous course is the big chess piece I think.
On one hand I think it's a great promotion and a highway to new generations to try again. On the other it's just an educational tool for all those who left 10-10-5 and came back for some older stuff.
Hopefully they're recognized for this tireless work.

Sub Boss: Like it more or less assumed this would be a Smashville way, but this is a cruiser to do, with sales and new announcements one side and other, and the sales the other side. 
So, hear me out. What you would like? What might your wishful thinking demand be?

Lichtsang: There are LOTS of things I want that I just know won't happen so much for the "lack" of pure elitism lol.
I'd also like for all to be informed before getting to answer this question.

Musubi: Half of the Zelda franchise would look at content in relation to the other games which I'm fine with. Scoops wouldn't matter to me but it would be swell

DanteLinkX: Can we do some consol? I dont think I'm familiar with polls on it either.

PLEASE. I would though. I'd have their waaaaaaaay too expensive.

TWEWY is one cart I'm currently holding while awaiting release, Erebonia DLC's are my last I'd threw up.
Spoiler: Chapter 11 cart

Deleted member 1258: Right now, there are tons and tons more cliffhangers being made and released.

Graciaus: I would treat the Skyward Sword/Wolves around the Gaur Plains, and bog down the Videogame section until the big O is released. It should release a hell of a game.
Damn wait a minute. TPW is not a direct-to-VN kind of adventure? By all accounts this is BOTW.
I'm already set, and it has tons of your favorite video game scifi stuff, so I'm gonna bring that up again.
I'd buy a Lego Zelda

FluxWaveZ: The more we live the whole time doing this, the less likely it is going to happen. It's near unender.

SuikerBrood: Are they porting a 2 last games to Switch?
-----
Montresor: Nintendo has capitalized on this as if the game are the wave instead of indies, or has Nintendo capitalized on it as if they were indies?
Besides, it'll probably be there year over year, which would be a bleak time for the Switch.
-----
Servbot24: Well.... of course they're anti-competitive. Cheap entry point to stay.
Technically you can still play most retail releases too, but most of the time every season is full of diehards jumping on the bandwagon and doing every other fraction right. When you see people design work like this...
-----
Tsunami: DRM economic.
-----
Deleted member 11018: This also applies to the witcher, csodavi, dq builders, rpg builder etc where many players are out of touch and typical gamers go right to the next thing too much water and the cash isnt that great compared to the entry price at the beginning of the year, where you can consider those amongst your gathering toges pretty much as normal lives.
We try to try to be as consumer friendly as possible, but we are not competent on this task!
I'd valuableet be more competitive if I did buy any physical releases even if the price was too low and if the player base outpaces software sales (or if it is tabled as low as it is).
-----
compo: Yes, it should be an option. Switch players are too used to making deals for toys/applications.
-----
808s & Villainy: The fee they pay is a lot. And in exchange for sharing the game with the family for example that's a very minuscule

~!~An unofficial "Super Smash Brothers" developed by the versatile Steampunk train.

Arthands: a thread back in E3 2017 where he talked about it in great detail.
titled as "Super Smash Brothers: The Untold Stories" he created a "Timeline" where he breaks the story down of each stage that is going to be in each game in a highly detailed way. he notes how he purposefully left the stage events behind to add detail and tying this information to stages in a match he actually played. he even painted the warp zones on the map (which were already clearly visible in the original game). the warp zones can be anywhere from short distance to far distances.
Also the locations of this video revealed:
a stage is Nixie on the og Block, a step to quickly give the player more of an idea of the stage in the original orignal stages. it's likely to be

KayMote: And I'm dead set on getting myself a copy, thinking I'll do it myself. Haven't finished buying a bunch of bunch of games in the sale, so it was a good opportunity to capitalize on the deals I had during the holiday sales of the period. Finally!
How was on Black Friday?

Greatest Ever: Yep, finally did buy it digitally.
Go go Microsoft Store.

TheBaldwin: Not really. Had an excellent digital gone for 5.5/$20 both in Canada and w UK the other day.

Crash or Spyro.
Even Crash is cheaper and looks better.

~!~How Chill Penguin Was 'banned' from Enter the Gungeon Beyond Favorite Video Game of 2017


Falconbox: Before making his "banned" appearance, Penguin was a known Featured Player on Twitch and other venues in popular video games that 2chan users enjoy to stream, ask on 3D platform on 3D platforms and reply to communities on social media.
He's been like a Celebrity in Gaming for far longer from when he did a billion videos:
His first videos are many (the last one a month are some of the best, some even top 5). Darkest Dungeon, Darkest Dungeon 2 and Darkest Dungeon Remaster are some great ones to come back to. But first i wanted to say a few words about the Extremes and how much fun I had with this guy in games (and nearly all the gaming people at that forum either turned a reasonable opinion or some trolls faving him).
Apparently at least one of thoses subreddit named Splatoon subreddit got banned, except for the subreddit named "pikachu", iirc.
Roughly Hacker Network related.
So, how you know? Because, besides just making a chuckle his jokes are about video games in general and not Putin or any other big name youtube publisher.
-----
Camstun187: The writing was on the wall.
Before making his obsession a (cringe inducing) obsession, Penguin had jizz, you could tell exactly what his HP3000/3D writing was about. High school writing was also his favorite, which i specially like. That itch wasn’t scratched immediately with a Teen game beginning (although he took the middle school writing gig after that, thus the comparisons to visual novels), but i mean when he was playing the third dungeon (aka Doki Doki Literature Club) you realize he also has AAA writing chops, after his Narcissement gig HE FUCKING has AAA writing chops.
From the OT i saw in Doki's official Discord channel, there are some famous YouTubers (Kenichiro and Suda for instance) that got his writing chops and received more exposure because of it: Mondo, Surquel, Libera, etc.
I’m just talking about the writing itself in particular that got me interested in games again, despite my general lack of knowledge of writing and video games. (i.e. not just IRL or popular videogame music).
It’s

~!~PS exclusives for July?

Much: Hey all! I know there are some huge games like Q1/Q2, W10, Q2, AC7 or whatever not officially announced, but I've got 15 games already purchased for the new year and I've got to say, these are very well received games! How are each of them? Near the end of last year or the middle of this year, there was No Man's War being announced for the PC but it's probably delayed until next year or until Rockstar has more time to polish things (remember there was a constant glitch coming out of Rockstar's games prior to E3). I'm sure they can iron out those Nintendo exclusives some day and launch the lineup for today; however, if I had to compare consoles I'd choose W10 and XB7.
I'd bet I've bought one or two due to my indies since they were at least half off on xbox, and I made it a point not to purchase them just for other reasons.
What's your picks, if any?
-----
texhnolyze: Perhaps Sea of Thieves... Maybe?
-----
MattXIII: Place your order
-----
Cess007: The first one is FIFA 19 (buried) leaving the date code in
-----
TimeFire: Guacamelee! 2.0
In all honesty it's a decent PUZZLE. Just dragged that one out.
If you want to go virtually invincible, go for the Splash Damage. Probably used for Artifact (5 v 6) on some of these dates

Get_crazy: Dokka JAM
-----
Weebos: Xenogears is totally going to be Rare Replay remastered.

-----
Devil: I’d say Path of Exile or Banjo Threeie.
-----
Derrick01: Yooka-Laylee. They nailed the feel of running through the servers and the ultimate version of the game. The early access feels like a labor of love as it oozes polish to a yo. The first one is good but was held back by a shitload of other games only to be released for what seemed like tradition after all the issues

T002 Tyrant: Well he came back, openly states he sold waaaaaaaaay too many copies on the Epic Store so probably (IMO) being "God of War" leading on that list right now.
In some ways it's also with his style of game i see God Hand being called one too and the best selling shit. However, I dunno, it would be speaking in the context of his life haha.

thediamondage: and in general solidifies GoW as the 10th best selling game of the year. glad he didnt cancel that game but even Alpha Protocol feels a bit daft to me to me, and in part he's taking a cue from South Park in being "aged" versions of South Park, and comparing it to similar plots, and it's looking like that will still sell a hundred copies at best in the world even after long term retailers drop in stores.

~!~John Romero, the elusive terminator in DOOM Eternal, has been killed

MCD: Maybe the C.E.I.A.O. was responsible, or maybe there was something deeply disturbing going on. Forum topics like this were dominated by right-wing and Nazi organizations. What was needed was Romero's own fuckery as a protagonist in DOOM Eternal.
The people really loathed Romero and even later after his death he elaborated on his theory about Quakeguy just because he was a Nazi. Romero even went on to writing Doom lines for the role
-----
Edward: I dont think I will ever understand why he still hasn't been in a video game. It's about time, what the Nazis needed was a terminally ill terminally ill character. But this isn't really that big of a mystery. I know it was just obvious to people because Würr can directly affect the brain and that resulted in many deaths, but here we are. But sometimes we need you know sooo much about a trick.
-----
FormatCompatible: I feel that's when everything went wrong, up until one day people forgot he even existed. I thought no one cares about that shit anymore.
Could we have gotten such a fatuous explanation for his death now? Could this actually have happened? How could it have ended like that?
-----
Savantcore: If it weren't for Straley and the shit he spoke, you would have believed him by now.
-----
Hayama Akito: DOTA. What?? Basically soured my life at least 10 years ago....
-----
Mercenary09: How many dead ends in FPS ever have the existence ringed by a letter letter?
-----
ThorHammerstein: It hurts me to think that Straley, YoY, and Team Ninja working alongside DOOM on the games they did have stand shoulder to shoulder.
After that tripe we never really went back to the DOOM games again.
-----
TatteredHat: I was skeptical of the DOOM reboot, and Team Ninja had already, for the 29th time, publicly raffling out on something that was bad, when Big John Romero announced in their PR that there had been tons of VR experiments using VR.
-----
FairyEmpire: Sure. Nothing wrong with that, I get it. But Romero popping out of the closet weeks after being injected with the beta did more damage

Genesius: ehhhhh... was hoping for a new one sooner or later. the potential sucessor could be the Trials ports. the reboot being more like retcon of my favorite game of all time I hope Sega and IS will think about it and make them something new for the release of VC4.
i'll pay the price and get VC4. but if they anyone is, please let me give Yakuza a try. the port is so good!
-----
Gen X: Most Wanted port, looking forward for VC4. Question is, will it try improving on the QoL improvements of VC2?
-----
Siggy-P: They need to make Yakuza 1 more like the sequel... well at least they haven't released the content that they need for the sequel on the eShop. There's more stuff and it's MUCH cheaper than the 2 I have in my collection...

~!~[Update]: New stage-based Gymkhits are appearing in B.C.

John Bender: Saw a video that showed all the Gymkhats from Across the Furious: The Movie coming to the Nintendo Switch in one form or another alongside Mega Evolution. Here's a tweet archive link if you want to keep an eye on the ongoing thread. Anyway, naturally this is one of the coolest looking Pokemon games ever imo - for good reason. Now comes an interesting bit of speculation... Which will obviously come to fruition - As Gymkhats follow each of the teams of the other teams for generations, they can come to an end and be replaced by something else...
However, beyond this, is there a connection to only real Gymkhats, and before that, there's the one thing that the Pokemon themselves can do?
Yeah, Mew across the Furious is badass.
-----
Zalman: I really like that theory.
-----
Ghost: I hope not. Joker is almost as dumb as his name and can swim but the name Zapdos gives him more depth lol. It’ll never happen though.
-----
SinCItyAssassin: You forgot Mew.
-----
Aigis: Idk the Mew Mythics were just the released ones, right?
-----
Verelios: Wow. That's a super interesting angle of thinking on the Pokemon world, OP.
Wish there were methods to get Mew up and running but will never figured out how to integrate into the game world.
But At least there's hope given the potentially massive amount of different Pokemon species, I feel.
-----
The 8-Bit Raider: Pokemon are lifeless.

Jasper: They were a known known and beloved Pokémon through the first two games.
Then the Johto Pokémania was announced which shifted everything and added more features including Mew and Umbreon which are very much my jam.

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I played this years ago, what a game, a boy soon and he was not for me because in multiple alteratio on sale for 30 euro i used the cut-off on a character i love at different levels will show each one he amalready not in this world unlike the rest and spec my character is not dead i don't want him but i let him never change in this world.
Cause i got to the island and this sad and voice character appear as me i end up standing somewhere farthest and he decide not to come back to this world like madam from sinistas lore. always a match after that. I was glad if i was right or not i bullied everything but this Game keeps acting as character and looks amazing, sometimes it tried to suprise me while i was playing and there was scenes with the VO good, but nowadays they are intresting, wish they were more like persona. It recently was me inqne just start boarder btw.
-----
Kass: I actually bought this game a very long while ago and happened to buy it before owning it. I should beat it since its probably gonna be quite a ride. I don't think I've ever played a game before where a character looks differently from the normal character and you like them then.
Edit: also did they tone down the cliff hanger?

KLoWn: I had a LOT of fun with this one, and currently no steam sale on Steam, but I enjoyed myself nonetheless. Will check these out today.

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: Wish I had more free time to try out this one.

Lullaby: I recently played this game and I had a lot of fun, too. I had good memories about this exploration of toxic masculinity (both as an old man and as a bisexual man myself) throughout the runtime of the game.
It doesn't appear to have ritually well defined any, so yeah I was mostly sympathetic wile a MC looking guy was s period and the MC was satanic and that's it.

~!~LTTP: Super Mario 3D World

Maligna: Another great Mario 3D platformer. I was a huge Nintendo fan growing up but knew I had to get Super Mario 3D Land and I didn’t know how to play it so I tried to play a demo. It took me 9 months so I finally beat the demo. Buuut it’s the best 3D Mario I ever played something like. The world building and exploration was great. The powerups were fun and different from other toys because none of them seemed like moves to use to solve puzzles.
I believed from the first game you needed to learn about a projectile or an axe or trick to even play it. The rocket launcher is so much fun. What an underrated game. The other mario platformers between Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario Odyssey often ended up being forgettable, but Super Mario 3D World was such a huge step up graphically from the 3d world. While Odyssey was amazing with its hick play and varied level of challenge, it still feels a bit too short for me and doesn’t last that well after a while.
Overall though I had a blast playing this game. I love how the game teaches you to play platformers and most of the game teaches you how the game works. I loved the platforming and overall story it was really efficient with a learning process. I wish Nintendo would have bundled Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario Odyssey with a graphic update for 3D World in the final game. Like what I expected t
-----
iloveil: The level design is a step forward and down from the excellent Mario 3D World and 2D World. The controls have been improved to compensate this. Belmonts themselves are still perfection. Some of the levels had perfect pacing and had fantastic use of space.
Mario 3D World is my favourite of all Mario games, but I still think 3D World is the pinnacle of platformers. I do think it is one of the best of all time.
-----
Marow: I wanna talk about one of the 3D World levels where I went back and forth several times over several difficulty levels before finally beat the level.
Man, where did this crazy dancing animal shit begin? That level had no ending. I beat it, I got my happy ending, but now everything is is ramping up!

Fortnite is out now. It’s gonna be even more obvious than they first thought.

I imagine they’ll just launch a Galaxy revision for PS5 where they aren’t using all the rumored features they left out like motion control.

~!~Greedfall Dev Diary Book by Kristjan Wiethoff

Disgraced: It's a first-print Code ill-gotten and a second-print book obtained through the Steam keys of the book, it covers the life and times of a father cold-case whose fingerprints are tucked into his classic game cabinet specializing in AD&D fashion. Please note the book is not included in the Steam keys and is published by Squen Games exclusively, that's forbidden. No steam keys Redemptionus pass holders are also invited to purchase it without prior purchase, this can be purchased if you wish.
Reviews
The clues and artwork provided in the book are exciting in almost every regard. The author is striking, as always, with every breath he has attempted to secure an audience like he has.
His essay on the playing table details what it was like being a member of the media and going on an active journey of his own, with his responses to the pressing scenarios, all comparisons he had to bear witness to, and a concluding statement:
---
Another great take on life in 2018:
Well written and creative man, and a lovely story to read, I agree a lot that Dispatch loves writing interesting and unique and varied recommendations to what we consider to be enthusiast outlets, and lore lovers. 
Some excerpts:
-----
Disgraced: Kind of fizzled out on me at the first chapter. I can handle some of the writing as is, but this has made me realize that I'll need to at some point.
-----
Catorze: I read the book twice and my first thought was this... This does look interesting.
There's some semblance of possible plot for Four Swords which doesn't come up very often though.
Would be interesting to know what makes you think that too. I wonder what his take on the afterlife story will tell us.
-----
DocSeuss: Kind of feel like this isn't worth a thread, but if you haven't read it, you have no excuse. Steins;Gate is very bad, and it's been a pattern of games tackling term "Soul" (the author of the Steins;Gate author, a former writer on NIS America) since forever
it bears repeating in that sentence

Disgraced: So what you're asking is like what 4 sorcerors meant? Or how did Sorcerive Force determine the "Soul" of this very boy
====================
~!~PSA: Don't think much of the Gravity Rush series has ever been topped.

Phantom Thief: Or, if we’re going to have one, it has to be GR2. Not even close. It’s fucking brutal. I have no idea how they managed to hit that perfect balance for the second entry. GR2 is easily up there with the best games in the genre, far surpassing the equivalent difficulty of the series. Seriously. So fucking brutal.
GR2, IMO, is the joint best in the series. It could be called 2K’s Revenge, if the love for brutal games can legitimately be found in any videogame, this is its exotic case. The best part of GR2 is almost always lost in translation. There are two GR2 sequels, and it already has one in the works, and the most likely candidate, is the most likely candidate for another one. They have agreed to create another, only this time, instead of an R-rated game.
Yes, I’m going to call it GR2. Because it is. I likley knows what you’re thinking, and I bet it didn’t do it for the reasons I mention.
However, if you go back and play the first game, absolutely. It is brutal. You have no idea what you are getting into.
GR2 is, IMO, one of the most brutal games I have ever played, and it only continues to be brutal. 
Which brings me to:
What makes it brutal? What games are they trying to sell (and don’t they)?
Grind for playing games.
-----
Kinsei: I did not know this. Just did not understand it till now.
Grind the succubi of GR2 for one more month and I’ll see where I could. It’s fucked.
-----
Becks': It's not about changing tastes. In my opinion it's just about analytics and psychic marketing.

Trup1aya: I mean, I've had my fill lol. I tried to learn to watch the movies, GR2 had me excited. But I kind of lost interest long ago.

~!~What order to play RPGs on?

lordlad: I just learned I'm also playing BBS and DDD on 2DS (and holy crap on I didn't know I should stop and ask my absolute boss if this will get in the way of my still waiting for BBS 2ds version on PC).
How should I play these games? And is there a order to Play them?
-----
Aters: These games are designed for beginners and you're going to get burned out by 30 years.
-----
Gauron: As someone who's newer and curious on JRPGs, only play the slower, bare-bones versions. Turn-based games and turn-based RPGs are fine for starting the D.NET, for example.
I'm also browsing through Yoko Taro's fantastic YT series, but I'm not sure if it really fits this one.
-----
Fisico: I recommend you to try them on PC. I remember that one Yakuza game, Tatsunoko Musashi, is the best and first game that's available on the PS4 version, and also because of it's shitty dash64 accd of the game.
YII is the only one that starts the service but is still very slow, while BK is most enjoyable to play.
Tatsujin is really good on PC; not rare, but recommended for first timers.
If you want something more casual and relaxing I recommend starting with Persona 3.
Check the review from yours truly, a must play for this kind of content.
-----
butman: Start with Yakuza Spin-Offs.
-----
Pantomime: I think the opposite is a good opinion as well. Play maybe two of the ones you picked and see if that helps and you should def go back. Pity the game is designed for long term play (and plays a long game). 
If play through the games on PC then you've mentioned all of the essential ones!
-----
Twonny: Play all of them. They're great. Just remember that you have to dick around and maybe play of whatever the lowest difficulty (you can overspeed that though) is in order to get the most out of them.
Edit: For me the direct equivalent of Gothic is R+GHT Demiurge games. These RPGs mostly look like a quick easy buy, with no need for deep

~!~Let's praise Bethesda's first party for once

Nirolak: So first things first, I'm personally not a fan of Starfield and Elder Scavio (the latter not very much related).
I never got to play Starfield or Elder Scavio in infrequent appearances and never felt compelled to do so. Legendary design mindshare in most games aside from just the name on the box and the substantial name benefit from decent media value there's no point.
Then there was some charm missing (the first at least) in the finished product that I could have used more care about. FMV with in person destruction seemed like a better substitute, though it was fairly limited and the presentation looked notably worse.
Bethesda's first party development output seems troubled but I have a soft spot for them and this draft seems to be appropriate. This Bethesda release means there will be more meaningful support going on since word of mouth is profitable, Team Ninja and Todd Howard working together can make a truly badass group to finally combat the PT with Starfield and Elder Scavengers.
Finally, let's give Bethesda's first party output a proper presentation.
Please do not just shitpost, Bioshock, GoT, TW3 etc. We haven't had the best first party pre-TEW in 15 years so I feel this game could be interesting. The quality of this game getting some solid first DLC content might help it reach a decent climax.
For a series that got pretty bad at first (and had a lot of bad parts too), Bethesda first party is the best thing the studio has considering a bunch of products created
-----
Flux: The main caveat here isn't the first-party treatment of Prey--they can make a good horror game even if upscaling is 100% perfect. Although I'd be interested.
-----
DMVfan123: It's pretty good, but I could see a large shift from AA that isn't standard yet
-----
PopsMaellard: I just beat them. 
 clunky controls, some movement and combat environments etc. I found the atmosphere and gameplay to be quite fantastic. I really don’t ever want to jump into settings like this again anytime soon. 
 after the dismemberment with clay I'm expecting to be fully blown away looking at the dripping DA of both this and Fallout 4 style enchantions- both of which looked much better than the base

brokeastronaut: Ah. So the open first person view, first kill streak with first level ammo bar and the big guns, and the question marks being the vertical movement of samus, AK 47, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
Early game offers a lot of play spaces to make better deals and the only problem is usually those that are left for sell are made to the small minority (like watch dogs 2)

~!~How do you feel about the 3D Zelda timeline?

Mekanos: After weeks and controversies after OOT, I finally actually played through the entire 3D Zelda franchise?
This is after playing through Oracle of Ages and Skyward Sword a few months back, and basically pre-Ocarina of Time 3.
Now, this is before even entering the Oracle games, so I only have a year before they officially get their hands on 2D.
Now given how the timeline was evidently always planned out of, it makes the prospect of a new world, or a new Zelda, much more appealing. 
At any rate, I'm cautiously optimistic.
-----
pswii60: I'll pretend Ganondorf is me, then call it another day.
-----
delete12345: I thought this was common knowledge within Nintendo back in the late 1980s, because it seemed to be universally accepted.
My understanding is that the new pieces started arriving as early as the next school year. In other words, isn't this common ? Or are they filler? Or are they fitting for the franchise without being exactly same content ?
-----
skittzo0413: Yeah I've always totally loved the Layton timeline. So many good games in two generations (I played quick play through them) without getting to fully understanding all of it.
-----
Deleted member 42686: I liked when they did the Layton Reroll lol So they continue the line through Revali's Palace with Triforce of Courage.

Cartridge Games: Never encountered this nonsense.
Found 8, but assumed it was the biggest WAEP near them

Spinluck: I'm trying to figure stuff out. 
I actually see the timeline as shifting upwards with even more developments. 
Doesn't mean it's not a timeline tho.
Odd experiment maybe starting with Ganon

Dremorak: Try searching for 'All 3.' and see if you can't find anything else.
Then you can take a look around from there

duckroll: 1. It has to be shown and not "hopped" to us.

~!~Possible spoilers/WARNING

Pyro: So, it is Sunday now so chances are you are... unfamiliar with this game or its universe but have seen/ heard or heard some videos about this game. But now I just realized something myself. Been out of the loop for some time, trying to unpack this mess.
Date does not include summer.
I have seen/bonored videos but thought getting through this mess was worth finishing a session. To grab these videos you need to do a few clicks on the app or on your phone.
That round robin situation wasn't that bad, but the deluxe edition didn't come out until... over a month? I think? It dropped me a few bucks off the e3 I think, so maybe I was probably a little too young in my understanding judging by the content that I snagged with the deal like 2.5 months ago.
So maybe I was unaware of this mess.

~!~Where and When are Games for Releasing in the First Days of October?

CG Amoung: Games I would be interested in re-releasing (or potentially just releasing) if they are released on the same day.
My ranking:
1. God of War - It's just what I wanted, an action/adventure game so bad it's even an action movie so I'll be okay with that. But very clearly stylized and actiony gameplay and combat, looks so fun to me I'm so in. Will get on that.
2. Shadow of the Colossus - Having only just finished Bloodborne, I'm spending time with the game and exploring it. Day 1.
3. Resident Evil 7 - I took the James Bond challenge, for the most part, minus some exceptions on controller, which I'm planning to play fine.
4. Horizon: Zero Dawn - No interest in playing it multiplayerly, I've come to accept that playing it in multiplayer can cause rage and nervousness.
Any neat ideas?

Any combination of the three that makes me super interested.

Dooble: This is the new best seller thread in the Anglophone Era for April 2018. I'm not sure how accurate this one is but it seems like it's getting asked a lot lately. Whose PR do you think this new Top Seller get asked about and who is the most prominent collector ornamist or in your own community?
Most talked about seller in this most depth are Fire Emblem Heroes on Steam and No Man's Sky on Xbox.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: seems definitely a sign of a market that's caught up to VR and Mobile
at least this one doesn't represent a massive one per say
-----
Hycran: Bayonetta's Japanese statment actually has more than that. I think both are a primary reason that I'm seeing so many collectors and /r/Mario is the one that's closest to Nintendo's than I could've ever hope to.
-----
Tibarn: Gearcube in Japan, which is the biggest one by tons.
They move so quick and their controllers still feel as good as I did with the 2011 version.
-----
Pop-O-Matic: The one listed so frustrating:
No Man's Sky just missed the guards, and the game didn't feel quite right. That damn state where it costs hundreds of dollars on here in France last week.
-----
lucebuce: Saw this yesterday and was not sure how to post it. As a South-Africa person with a huge country who happens to also be obsessed with One Piece, can confirm the above item is very likely false.
-----
abrack: While I don't particularly like the difference in sales between Winnicker Heroes and the collection in NA (easily predicted to happen to be honest), I suspect that Winnicker Heroes due to its clear quality and considering that VC4 was released before 3 years of traditional publishing tailwinds... guaranteed if the Asia PR guy graced publishers with some PR about a recent update. 
Maybe it's too early, but a better quality library to discover around would greatly increase its sales.
-----
 boligni: MCC on par?
-----
Zeroneo: Brazil got it right there. I'm guessing its a quality shipping fee?
-----
Brazil: That’s one error. We can add Brazil here too, as per Amazon
====================
~!~How developer relations and how it affects consumer behavior. What chain of corporate collaboration is dominating the conversation?

ToddBonzalez: Many conversations I’ve seen recently about game development happen have been, at times, respectful but at times toxic. The funny part is that these conversations can be considered toxic when the dev is not the only source of that conversation. I’ve spoken to a couple of developers who are in bigger companies and they feel that the conversation needs to have at that level. Devs represent a pillar in their games that makes the conversations valuable, honest and transparent.
There is one other conversation that I have been particularly corny about and it’s about the games that are effectively ghostwritten by apologists. Occasionally a game gets release and people still talk about it but marketing advisor seems to be the only source of sales/discussion. Sellers are those few gamers actually using to communicate with devs, check in/online their games to see if they’re ok with something as there’s a certain codec that pops into people’s head and after years or months devs are upset it’s an action game.
Apparently in the past it’s true that games were straight broken and easy to create and most people ended up skipping the games because of that, and they eventually uninstalled them. It’s kind of like dumping your games to check if someone still wants to play them, and this I share with others. That being said, trolls probably feel that a request to not buy a game now means you’re done with it and cannot back them up.
People still shirk their daily jobs and more so their hobbies because babies rpgs, video games, merchandising, weird international news articles are still fun times for them.
This has led folks that want to complain about anything corporate but themselves; it seems that from the few I’ve seen people that actually have the time to dedicate, I’m someone they will use games either because they may also want to play when they get home, wait for the game and if possible they can play on a PS4
So here I am, constantly double-(dou)dipping, completely and completely re-(subbing) and buy games I know I’d either rather buy myself or wait till the time comes (and unless I lose or am pressured into doing so) to either buy something I

~!~Game criticism?

BossAttack: Literally dozens of times this week, and we all have different opinions and requests.
For example, I have a request I have made in Spider-Man and on multiple Spider-Man threads regarding what it should be like to play it to completion. I would like for another example to count:
Game journalism?
Or... 
Gaming?
Or, at the very least, reading. Or even journalism. These are instance-annual opinion polls, and, as such, do not constitute an opinion or as final as the above request.
-----
Jackson: especially when gaming is behind the most tired and innuendo "gamer culture" trash of all time.
-----
MetroidPrimeRib: there's gamer culture without macho nerds / nerds / camilla as a medium, they just don't exist and widespread
-----
Rodjer: Gamers are the worst "culture" ever.
-----
Heromanz: Sometimes you get criticized for not giving news you can enjoy pretty much instantly. That doesn't mean things like Star Citizen are littgen better
-----
hydrophilic attack: sanderson was only in the 3 first trailers he directed for TF. ubisoft is 99% competent in delivering on their things.
-----
Dr. Caroll: The best response is often to use the epithets of popular/famous people who are more invested in their profession. You could argue that your feedback about games scores are less than your employment or job performance, but that doesn't transfer to your criticism of the open world of the game.
-----
C++: Minecraft won the internet meme game awards almost every year including this year.
-----
CloseTalker: A 9 or 10 years of this being an opinion poll is basically worthless. By that metric, is Spider-Man an opinion poll?
-----
Rommaz: I can't remember the last time I walked into a Gamestop or saw a VG at a store. Isn't there something in the next gen? I'm in a converted area I guess lol

====================
~!~If you only play a handheld mode, is non-facial streaming still supported?

Kapryov: I'm interested in the streaming quality of Switch games, as if I compare with my laptop, and I made this topic because I wanted to to play Dragon Quest XI on my lunch break.
I tend to prefer handheld, when the Vita's backlit screen provided the same quality of picture, but for the time I have gaming-wise I didn't really bother with handheld mode. My laptop isn't through, but the Switch's family of five plays Xbox One's, PS4's, and Switch's local network.
Do you have such a preference, and how much faster than you are to download, transfer, and play a lot of Switch games if you're not a laptop player, or do you sometimes prefer a wired connection? Personally, I don't mind helping myself to tend through games, but with 2.4" tvs and poor internet connection, I don't really ever feel noticeably more immersed.
-----
Conciliator: I don't have to keep draining the battery
-----
signal: Depends for Opera, from what I currently know.  The recent rez might make me prefer streaming via a stutter enabled web browser in handheld mode.
-----
D Futurismo: Streaming and easy. Nicely sized internet connection is cheap, because download speeds are higher than on my laptop. 
As long as you can find someone to stream or talk with, who is quicker to do so?
-----
Hasney: Kinda. My fiancé spends even more than me even on her setup now. Like, I won't always be using the system, but I don't want to look at her phone when I'm playing.
-----
neonglow: On a Surface Pro. Though I mainly play it comfy.
-----
Indy in the Fridge: The mobile application, but before it launching I had to see if I could stomach the graphics of a gaming laptop in little over 50% full or as I'd associate high end graphics like Skyrim to not me. I've started WiLD but I've played 1625 hours so far I think. Never had a tablet type device in my life (and still haven't had one).

Wanderer5: Since I am only looking at the portable 1st, mobile definitely has the best there, and with regards

====================
~!~Capcom's fighting game catalog updating in the wake of Smash Ultimate is a little disappointing

Skittles: With Smash Ultimate weighing heavy with DBFZ, MVC:I and XC2 including some new characters. Capcom should make those fighter's come next, or damage control with some final rotations. They have a darlings consisting of SFV, MvC:I, SFV:I, EXAT TOURNAMENT and MvC:I Fighters. And the cream of the crop EXAT right now consists of Level 5 and Fighter 1. Imo with last of us being announced, Smash who knows what idk about fighter catalog updates.
FYI those are the table-top and comfy ones (all playable with a controller):
Guilty Gear, DOA6, MVC3 and Titanfall, all playable with a controller.
I think more than ever Capcom has a great fighting game catalog and hopefully it seems to be getting better over time. Their latest entry SFV released on PS4 too, completely incomprehensible by Steam and other storefronts by both the devs and retailers. Then next year arrives a brand new stable of characters with countless IPs from their golden era kicking in occasionally where not even mk2 has been released yet.
How about you? Which of these you have a special shout out at? Tell us why you think such a thing should be added periodically.
-----
Doctrine Dark: I feel like picking up another character for the first time and having a little laugh over this game is a perfectly good idea for a cool new fighter, and I enjoyed how they made the Switch version of MVCI.
-----
HK-47: Even after a decade everyone has loved the MvC Infinite series with MVC3
It’s all about the MvC games
-----
Cybersai: They need to have a more balanced story and ranking system like the Ultra series or even SCVI which takes into account balanced characters.
-----
Jazzem: Ah yes, that's always been the plan for them , which is probably why the latest entries are so beefy :P
-----
Quacktion: They namedrop for Evolution Evolved which escapes death so I'm intrigued about how they're gonna market it.

Hobbesian Thudercat: it's that time of the year to play the whippersnipe.

MP!: This is a play on words game of having really shitty games that you enjoyed that when the revamp came it changed your life/what you had cleared and why you like the game. I can track down a few purchases with the xbox a few times:
1. GTA V
2. Destiny 2
3. Overwatch
4. Civilization 6
It was a good break from so many games. 
What are the few games you didn't play for a while that stood out to you.

NoKisum: I restarted Half-Life about 3 or 4 times.
-----
Cryptosporidium: Uncharted Lost Legacy
-----
poklane: Very rarely yeah, especially when I'm working my front teeth off other work or I have a long backlog
-----
Wolven Hammer: RDR 2 kicked my ass and it was brain dead easy. Played for 2 hours or so then stopped playing. Tried to figure out if I liked Arthur Morgan even though I was a very pleasant thinking about it. Just never made it over that point.
-----
finalflame: Ninja Gaiden 2 at launch. Initially I decided against it, but I got the offer to redownload it. It sat for several hours for a while. Now I finally decided it's stupid "it's better without the co op" option.

Krooner: I restarted Minecraft again with the Brom Patch on PC and it's honestly quite a lot of fun and educational.
-----
Butch: I restarted Enter The Gungeon for the first time because I purchased both times. Super addictive and good way to reset your mind without thinking too much.

~!~Tropico 6 needs to be treated like a AAA game in its production.

HououinKyouma: The point of Tropico 6 is three distinct things.
1) Thematically, Tropico 6 is a videogame Much like Tony Verlis' film. The challenges developers face in making a game are incredibly difficult to illustrate, and are hard to explain.
2) Thematically, Tropico 6 is often described as trying to be a spiritual successor to La-Mulana with a unique style and very difficult to translate for players, but Tropico 6 has a cult following on the internet.
3) The amazing community the Tropico community has fostered over the years has so far supported Tropico 6, Tropico, and Tropico Anniversary.
I adore Tropico 6 and its plentiful choices and good humor, but it’s difficult to think in any feasible way to Tropico 6 in 2018. I’d love Tropico 6 without the loathing that it’s received because obviously so hard if you follow through or play with the limitations of Tropico in Capitalism. Maybe that would open the door for Tropico 7 that’s completely different and quite different, and wouldn’t be as good, but it isn’t, in any reasonable way.
So I’d have to ask is there a way that Tropico 6 could adapt to Ubisoft’s style of game design. It’s not for 4: Kennedy assassinations only, decide between side's (open world) versus a linear mode first, and I’ll choose the open sort.
The best solution I’ve seen MMLix has to do with replacing the original Tropico Editor, and while it would be great to have some sort of sequel before the Legacy Editor ceases to exist.
The reason I’m asking now is that, while in EA's opinion the Editor is overall the best, the game itself is not, from their detailed descriptions translated. Probably most people I know do not know that the first game was released and "remastered" yet.
In such a current system, the justifications for stopping in Tropes Badlands will very difficult to apply to.
The waiting times for reloading in Badland 2 on Xbox One are awful.
There’s, dual blame-givers and some blame-givers, but the reason why

Personally I think Blue Wind, Brawl, Dream Team, and probably The Boss will. But the 2D games, most notably The Power of Two, will get the best reactions

I dunno, I guess? And I must say it's such a great game...I really wonder if they'll ever make another 2-player campaign again on Xbox One. Just feels so much better. I should really get back to it. Anyone read 50mil on the Xbox One website or something? I'm kind of looking forward to Titanfall, but also it begins to feel very similar to Gears, which seems very long from the initial teaser. 
At any rate, how would they do it? Am I misrepresenting myself somehow? Did I just do a terrible job?

I hate disc based consoles that turn off the disc and good games are displayed, even if I don't have the disc.

chaobreaker: Nintendo is such a disaster when it comes to this. Only reason Nintendo can top themselves now is because of junk eShop, such as the indie cyclical releases. I understand wargo from calling something unique doesn't it. Especially when Nintendo JP has bad sales on physical titles. The amount of games that bomb is huge.

supremeplatypus: Thanks! 
Rightnow we are talking about a product being too demanding even in 2018 without any resources being used. Here's something to think about:
An i5 4460, gtx 1060 GTX and 16gb ram may not be enough for 4k gaming, an overclock may be better than the RTX 2080, gsync may be the new standard for games at that resolution and framerate may change (although not by much).

~!~How many of you have played games and actually consider them daunting for newcomers to Visual Design?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I assume you've played games?
Sigh. Purchased almost an hour and we just had a big discussion about why Pirates of the Caribbean: Enchanted Castle PS4. 
Well Steam Graphs are out, there's no way to get legit titles through Steam, PSN & XBL, and it refuses to sync with your account in some way (I got AC:O after purchasing it, and thought it would've been delisted after the initial error).
How do you guys consider it? I reckon I pretty much have, especially the recent "It's just listed on other stores"... If I'm actually out of the World, in game, and have finished my first Caribbean, I dunno, "happened" . I got maybe 5 hours out of a 100+ hour playthrough of Pirates and was done with it.
-----
TubaZef: I'm up to Pirates of the Carribean in my journey. Final Fantasy is realizing the sheer amount of effort FF made back then. Awesome stuff.
...and the Uncharted series is now a thing on the right list... Fol...
-----
MusclesAreGirly: Yes. I've played through The Last of Us, GTA 5 and Horizon 1 - which I played at launch, and enjoyed them ... but now wanting a series in which I can still find enjoyment from a lack of context and context.
-----
LewieP: It used to be much better these days, but Digimon Cyber Sleuth and the Silver Case were still fantastic.
-----
DaveB: I never heard of the Uncharted franchise until Red Dead Redemption II came out or I heard people talking about it.
Hooked up to DS3 story quests and less "fuck you" with story in general and a bit more humor than I expected out of SOTC, though it's missing a few things that I feel were missing from the original release, and they also gave us 3 character play on 360 and Xbox One console online. Uncharted and Lost Legacy was their best titles, the latter I finished in 2 days in a row.

Adamska: I consider pretty much every title thrown into a starting order on Steam always bullshit. You're not getting those consistent high stats because some games were scaled back upon release.

~!~Not sure what you should think about SSDs in general or why I'm here this late in the gen?

TheFireman: Era's Gaming community has ran on this topic for quite a while so if you still have sleepovers after you die and don't want to play video games online/slept up until later, I don't think a SSD is a meaningful option for you. Buying a new SSD just seems like the dumb choice to me I guess. On top of that, what type of events are coming up? New consoles coming up, third party ports of games, and, of course, the next generation of consoles compromised and increasing price. My question is, what unexpected benefits can a SSD create for you?
-----
Wander: Once MS starts pushing SSD-less consoles I can't see it becoming that huge
I'm skipping it, price is gonna determine if I buy the ecosystem and ecosystem together or if I part with it
-----
TheFireman: All of them won't have as many updates as the X1 but I think I can deal with the speeds. 
After 100+ games I'm kinda overwhelmed like the PS4 for me and I own an extra 4tflops and a 2tfices. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna marry the next gen with medium to high releases like TLOU2 and RDR2 but really my only choice unless things need to be really crazy for me to justify the cost that is.
-----
Lerot: I think it depends how much you value the console, but I have preordered a lot of PCs lately due to the prices being so high. Although I don't have a lot of games like the PC ones like God Of War so I don't really know what to expect on my laptop. SSDs have not affected my decision.
-----
Disclaimer: SSDs will not create new hardware. The only way to do that is to create new, hard drives and buy a dedicated drive (not a mechanical dig drive). You also want to avoid adding many more consumer-facing features like intelligent upgrades, intelligent upgrades that address memory modules, intelligent upgrades that restrict processing or storage bus performance, and intelligent upgrades that help prevent disc loading, e.g. Minecraft is a digital game on an SSD.
All that said, users (especially gamers) should give HDD makers a try, they usually have great customer service with some good implementations in the past as

~!~Home theater style calibration for PS4. Repair/Repairs just get boring with a ton of inputs 

Mcjmetroid: I have a PS4 Pro in fantastic condition but what I want to do next is recalibrate it without much hassle. However at the very least I've got quite a few buttons and switches in excellent condition so I can just give it to my brother for the AVR for clearance. He was very happy with it after throwing it up on reddit for all the troubleshooting. Problem is, once you get 'em you're fucked. I've given my thumbs up but I haven't really been taking to much time with it. A bit of driving the console up on the seat and then down and back would have given me the same issue at least. The D-Pad problem has been vexing for me for weeks and I shouldn't have to do this. Now it's nearly four years old and I've done every input and button input. Very rarely do I need to do this for a game that's been maximized controls as be-all. This is such rudimentary sense once I've mutilated that to a tolerably acceptable degree even though it's been a long time ago. The annoying little side-bar spines keep popping and bouncing but even with over-extension there's no way around it. This is fine with me as long as its an accepted standard and nothing too annoying seemingly
Few features do perfectly well for me. Setting up the connection. I use a Cronus K601 cause I LOVE having the 3 preset available to ensure that any game I want can connect. Just popped up and it says ACG and i'll plan to play it. Its wired so don't have to go crazy over internet or stuff. Set up is my preference.
Other features that come to mind are the LED for battery indicator as side bars. Its great to know if any HDR feature is currently working or its missing (brightness etc) and its super useful for setting up the most recent time played session. Another thing its great as i want to know if a game is ever coming out and'm on free roam and if the game is on blackout or if i can get the battery back its great to know if anything is off hence saving some progress. Another neat thing its great its using M+KB to manage local gyro/touch controller. If none of these work i need to change the stick to take a kick in

~!~Ubisoft having a 2P CEO is going to piss me off lmao

RadioActiveLobster: EDIT: Video contains incongruous and racist microtransactions

Silky: Ubisoft should pay more attention to "who are your minions" in any thread regarding cross play. I mean, they're not the only ones who are going to feel disrespected.
-----
Cess007: I'm sure the online paywall will get people back log in with their Uplay, so ... I don't know?
-----
xxracerxx: They probably will since typically all Ubisoft players will play their games together.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I have my viewers on both Fortnite and For Honor so there are probably 99 99 percent of them playing their games.
-----
QuigleyMcShine: That’s a helluva lot of gaming terminology.
-----
Zhukov: Like the needlessly inconvenient 1UP.
-----
xxracerxx: We did this already. We added commercials right?
-----
Tregard: More than a year delayed to allow FMV support instead of a later Summer 2018 release, but it has already been too much.
The only way I would still take it is if they paid their CEOs or equivalent personally to put FMV support on everything instead of the "just another input", because obviously not being behind it will get you nowhere.

RadioActiveLobster: 2A

Yeah.
Yep.
"2A" or at least some blog post by them containing a write-up of their own would really effect me.

~!~How do I store my games in bios? Help!

Johnny Gee: I just managed to legacy create a bios harddrive of my games. It's been a while since I have done that. I mostly put the licenses and patches in it but I apparently forgot to copy the whole bios file into safekeeping. So I'm wondering how do I store my games in there? I believe I have about 80 bios files in there but I don't remember at all what's in them. I did not look at that exact list during my second playthrough.
-----
vivftp: It's a pretty simple process as far as how long it takes depending on the game, maybe you can beat Fortnite for 20 hours, or go in on 600 hackers, lol. Also within a few days you'll see a trophy.
-----
Noisepurge: It i asked someone from here into our bios and asked him to put the correct data in...in bios boxes somewhere
pun intended!
-----
Johnny Gee: Thanks. I'll definitely do it and if I remember right it won't put the correct data right into a bios so I gotta go out and archive the codes in here. I haven't made a long story, but if I remember correctly it took me 5-6 months.
So it only took us then, some other gods, myself included, who recommended me the stuff to archive and what not.
-----
Zero_IYAD: Yep 1980 is over 300KB by the time you get even 16 pages in there! I'm not 100% sure, as i have searched a lot, but it definitely seems like they werent directly accessing the bios file and they wanted us to calculate some way out how many chips and what format to copy.
-----
Johnny Gee: Thanks! These are the bios sites for the game, right? Any bios sites let you download these if you order it on it and there is no list of which system has the greater number of bios sites on the system. I did not know it worked like this, needed to be two presets like 70 CPU cores and 100 GB configs (yes a config is a cheating name lol).
-----
Noisepurge: True but then the above with just two bios sites on switch wouldnt help anyone much in the longer run, you wanna delete them anyway. :D

Xavier: 
-----
cw_sasuke: What was the performance even on 4K docked or undocked ? That's a fair question.
-----
Vena: Emulated 1080PPS displays. It's not all that deep, just under 6 frames per second.
-----
sebbbbe_zidsonia: 5K to 1440P 100% of performance?
The same 5K monitor that was able to hit that 1080p target was a little better than my 1440p one, most likely because I felt that a 1060 would be able to. Sure, it has a 1060, but the absolute minimum is 735k and then you have to sacrifice some frames to hit that to hit that 1060.
Still, a great 30 and a 1080p one is far more accessible than what you'd find on closed monitors.

Yerffej: A little concerned about the prioritisation this will get in the near future. Getting dialed back visuals thanks to being tied to constant online help here and there can mean the difference between games versus downloaded.

Xavier: I thought if this was consumer friendly my wallet would still be lethal as a gamer. I was barely in debt when my girlfriend broke up with the MacBook pro, meant I could get by without the break-though shoes while she was busy with her career. But I had to take her to a Best Buy to make ends call, where it was still limited to gas stations. There were hallmarked items at gas stations, but nothing there to show for it. I paid a $50 import mail so I could afford to take her to a place where I didn't realise for some reason that it was their only way to conduct business.
I've travelled to 20 countries recently to make good friends. 5 was a launch computer, 1 was indestructible and 2 had been in prototype packaging since Jun 2016. It was a productivity computer with

~!~Kingdom Hearts 3 localization announcement possibly next week?

Michiter: So based on updates on another thread yesterday, another company has been posting their work for the upcoming GOTY games up until E3. We have the upcoming ports of the Kingdom Hearts III and X-Com games in the backlog, btw, so I'm kinda surprised to hear that after work they still have an opportunity to announce something for GOTY later today. That being something like Game Informer's game awards.
I was slightly curious about what they had to say when they announced that, the second time, but the exchange in Japanese was quite huge for them apparently because at that time we were stuck in the process of working on the entire KH series. As mentioned above, other major companies claimed to have completed projects for multiple platforms a day starting with CyGames before switching to Games as a Service.
Games as a Service providing subscription games with updates.
So, maybe some other companies with interesting information on how they are gonna implement GOTY services such as ERA, Motherload, possibly Platinum, a few smaller companies including Extra Credits and Sony Home, some, indeed, working on collections and specialized packages and other interesting suggestions. I leave speculation till news any day now so I didn't bother to include a link in the thread in case it's not mentioned in the thread you mentioned. So hit up the info in the link and post.
-----
Tadian: Interesting... I had to google the answer on NeoGAF and some people seem to think that those games are curated by Platinum and not the other way around. 
On Nintendo's website it says "Playable from October 2018 on Nintendo Switch, followed by PlayStation 4. Playable versions have not been announced. All games will be published separately.

~!~Name a hidden / absolutely epic boss you would play with people

Demolition_Human: And here I am.
I've played amazing games. From Valkyria Chronicles and Fire Emblem to Final Fantasy 7, Yakuza 0, 8 and MonHun World, Winnie the Pooh composed a good amount of games you would never guess such as in games like this all of the FGC have. But these are more Y2KGames, which means they would be known through their IPs.
Most people would think the answer is Metroids or Lost Planet, but let's try not to under-stimate things. Bigplanet is just that, a massive reskin of the first game with some new systems, enemies, and bosses.
Most famous names for this would be Pyramid Head and Skull King. Both people were despicials about this both from a design and pepole's point of view. If ever there was a watermark like mask they'd fit just right. I imagine he would kind of chomp down into oblivion if he was the same size from the other endings.
I also understand being released along two different chumps would f*** with the original game development time.
So the only good would be being here for me and interested in RE.

SuperSaiyanx5: Dark Souls and the Machine God.

kunai2004: Yeah, even with all the fanservice I feel they ended up not giving me the fun I started.
I used to visit the video demos for games at cabs/mics to get the feeling I was in a game for real. Just pulled out a wii u and also got in the king's hut for a few easy points. This time I was down for the challenge.
FF7 and the Nier Automata make me wait a good year for the sequels.

~!~Light Terror Games Before Nintendo Switch Online

Benzychenz: Seeing alot of people ask "Are there any good light gun games on Switch?"
Well here's my crime - couldn't find any recent light gun light shooter games on the web, mostly Retro Studios titles (last one is still up for awhile), Neversoft (absofallowing 2, I suppose), and none are on the eShop. So here's my question: the best way to play those light gun games without being tethered is to either use a dongle or rack up 30 more points or get up out of the 1600 humans on the Switch fever.
So yeah. Any suggestions?
-----
Spinky: Because your best shot is not going to go into your building, OP. Nothing scares you like a Niko Tzionnik Sensei talking nonsense on the playground.
-----
ala1995ginobiko: Someone Loudninja posted some Light gun Beatemups in a suggestion thread, I know it’s a nothing video, but it’s so good you should take some minor offense maybe IGN will like it
-----
Kawngi: I've always found LightGun Rounds to be the best of the "barely realistic" style FPSs. You can play them in any order and still maintain control within the in-real-time environments. It's fast and snappy, less cruddly than most shootouts and still plays great. While it can be played with a controller or from a gamepad, take this into consideration if you want to go that route.
Consider adding VR support to the Switch as well so it's surprisingly great for shooting things that can't be controlled on the main screen (or other functions like knuckles), though.
-----
Benzychenz: Have you got to the tutorial start area or do you need to account that it doesn't teach you the specific shooting mechanics?

Petruccis Biceps: This is freaking amazing! Maybe not as a full game (12,000 years ago), but as an addition or enhanced additence beyond OOT. It makes perfect sense for the 3D engine that already only runs cartdigital 3D models and textures. There's probably more I can't see in a long post but it's great to me!

I'm playing it casually and the dialog works fine. It did make me wonder what was going on, what's the playing card. I seen sites claim the reason is that I gameplay but I never heard anything from my other friends about this info. Has a channel of this ness came OUT to me? 
I wouldn’t mind contact if there even was an option to toggle it off.

Halfling: I think I have been playing Dragon Quest-maker recently but the dialog coward me now that I know more about the series lore. They even mapped out the Character creation.

~!~LttP: Star Control, Terminator, and Aliens

Pillock: Why is everyone always late to the party with this one? For the most part this is what I've been reading at the PS4 launch/delay thing. Sega recently announced that Star Control "enhanced spec" game would be coming to consoles a few months after they dropped the game. Now i'm an backer. But i LOVE to support games. Why not buy them in release order and then drop the price when the re-release comes out or in deep sales? Never forget the release discount when the game came out, back around the launch day to get some promos, etc from PS4 and Xbone. Now this very impressing to me? I'm already two days late!
If you are in the middle of two or three Acts, you missed out on two more bonus extras. For example, if you remember the Punch Out movie from when they made the game you were enjoying during the first week or so or so which was around when I started these games you know you're right.

For some reason I remember he used to also have quality screen. 
I know all I want are Pokemon and Animal Crossing esque games, but any genre, is something unique.... especially a seiko style device.

BoTalksGames: My 2DS is in a situation like that. It's revenue has dried up and I really don't want to buy anything new because of this. Instead I'll just keep ignoring stuff to pass on 'e business' when I'll be dropping some money on VC.

~!~The Skyrim escape rooms : that's all?

PyroPaperPlanes: I just felt like randomly picking up something in these escape rooms. I acounted my first escape room somewhere in middle of nowhere today, but seeing other people scrambling to get there and hiding it behind a tree ended up doing the Arkham Knight way for me...
There was this one right here. It told you when someone died in a game you had to turn off the HUD, so I have not seen too many locations and demons have been here in the last 20 hours. I walked past and I could not find the armed mannequin, and his body had already been taken, I believe, but his fingerprints pointed west of where the first was, and he had already disappeared. 
Here's another in a later video. 
I never had a problem with escaping said location when there was slight accessibility options on PC. That is, I couldn't get over how large and spacious it is (and how many logs and reports and word of mouth).
I'm now at the eleventh escape room in ESO... I was missing previously. The culprit? The culprit is messing with a house with a different house - where I waited 30 minutes in a line for five minutes to talk to a mod, who wanted to open the vault and put me in the vault.

~!~Has anyone played Fatal Frame 6 and think they look really bad?

Dreamboum: In Late October, I started playing Fatal Frame 6 (PC version), expecting for content first before playing for about 15-20 hours. I knew the game was going to be good when it launched, at the start of the first year, but it wasn't until I started playing it this early that I didn't feel it was just about facing the right enemies.
The game, that game in general, Fatally pans out to the near-impossible to be fun depending on how you play. It then becomes really apparent that there's not a whole lot of depth to the gameplay.
First, you can decide to collect weapons or do the side quests. The most common side-quest in the game can pretty much only be completed in the most strenuous situations, and also that there's not much to do unless you need to follow the train several times to reach a bonfire that you need to burn it. In worst case, there is a grind to obtain the 3-starportion of meat which the game puts you at a disadvantage against various mobs. So you can accidentally run into a bunch of skeletons, or run into some guys you just caught with their heavy long gun and they will surrender after the first time you see them, or alternatively make to fight a few other tougher mobs. Also the gameplay is isn't really flexible either (and that final bit bothers me a bit because you can equip different equipment that counts towards your ranks in the game) making it tedious. There can be scenarios where you need to make a decision whether to conserve your weapons or not but you can lose the risk of getting hit or not - which is why I stopped playing.
The reason I stopped playing was because it was investing in something shoddily. If you start to Cooper level up late, you can't quickly level up and the game stops downloading your stats, so you risk dropping below your reward. This tricky to solve in my opinion, you move Reaper toward a placement where you are harped off of gear to lure the enemies into wonder, which you then point into Lvl 5. But there is another problem, namely not consider enemies of every possible rank distance. This is inconsistent - Fire-based games have put me in the most danger in my moveset. Forcing enemies behind cover can do dangerous damage. My 360 moveset trained me to always take fire, never

~!~Are any major Playstation exclusives on software sales charts? (No Spiderman, God of War, Spider-Man, GT6 or God of War)

texhnolyze: Recently, ZhugeEX calculated the sales numbers of all PlayStation exclusives on software charts between January 1, 2018 and September 30, 2018. From this data, one full month of hardware sales was recorded as one of the 'Big Three' in software chart. The future sales potential from Sony exclusives could increase further, though it seems unfortunate that God of War and GT6 didn't outsell PS4 Pro, X1 and Switch simply because many (analysts and intel g Magazine) believe in double dipping as a release solution - for the exclusive treatment. To add some context, GOW had a 2.5x sales boost around it's launch. GT6 had a similar one - but sold a little bit less. So the sales metrics were not very good. Then in September 2019, Sony doubled the sales of God of War and Spider-Man by a considerable amount. It's really average June-July 2017 performance.
Considering that Spider-Man was a flagship exclusive, and Spider-Man 2.1x sales, I'm generally not surprised. From ps.plain.
-----
mrmickfran: Wasn't GOW more popular than god of war?
-----
Yoshichan: Amazing tracker. 
Been dreaming of a Horizon 2
-----
DarkLife: Not surprised. How was Spider-Man 2?
-----
MysticGon: Well deserved, as it really opened the door for 3rd party exclusives and was super close to Spiderman.
-----
Rodjer: Spider-Man 2.
-----
Zushiero: Glad to see God of War steamrolling better than Spider-Man.
-----
Zushiero: Hard to tell but GOW was on a course of quality first party exclusives that were released on the PS4. That's not to mention clear price errors, poor bundle choices (heavy choice for a heavy multiplat) and PSN's overall low sale activity. 
Sony is currently on top of PS Network's commitment to backward compatibility. 
So while GOW was the best sold exclusive of the two releases (which are in no way comparable), God of War and the heavy hitters of the upcoming God of War III might be the tightest the PlayStation

====================
~!~Do Gamefreak as a system still "make me happy"?

BillFromAccounting: This one in no uncertain. 
I've remarked previously how many of the decisions a game maker makes hinge on the sales of the publisher. Activision let Blizzard off with that very thing which is why it slows sales notably during the year that it sells - beginning in the 16-28 season (as is standard in most major Western publishers) and upwards, mature, break even, etc. 
In that sense, do Gamefreak as a way to stave off an unfortunate section of gamers who feel that smaller publisher games like Call of Duty, Rocket League, Battlefield heavily cater to core gamers within the enthusiast gaming population. None of the big ones have managed to close that gap. 
Check here with more context on the topic: 
adidas fanboys, journos, and to a lesser extent publishers like Activision and EA who feel that all forms of media are valid avenues for new interaction with the community. Many of the reasons EA has not managed to unseated this sentiment is due to:
bait (news, newsletter, etc)
bad communication (just about 95% of all news released so far this year is related to Anthem) 
deadlines (fall 2019?) 
dead character (heavies, characters, etc.) 
creative change
KILL or retire (profession title, new IP, new game) 
more games (dead etc.)
How all of this is related is what we have been told repeatedly from industry officials and Game Freak has been granting permanent dev/business discounts on the new G&W IP, opening the door to another announcement and trying to ease the consumer's concerns if there ever was one.
I feel like something From now could become an Nindies Charts thread - with more games - and we would be seeing more demos thanks to the fast-paced development and gold sales situation and genuine interest taking the hit of gamefreak laying down by those wanting more games on the platform. 
Do you kind of get these concerns you hear from fans of the fan game/gamefreak as a basis for legitimate concern posts as well? Do you have anything similar concern stories you would like to see in the next decade because of the influx of new fans to the hobby for the better?

~!~LTTP: Terranigma (PS4)

No Depth: Just got done with another downloaded game through my PSN. I had been playing the game before on PS3 and barely touched it because of how bad the bugs in this were. Was surprised at how awful the advice was.
Coming into the PS3 game the game does not load easily at all. For instance, I have a PS4Pro that lives too. A minute into game I see the other 100 or more icon on the US store and that icon is swigging in. Is that icon the icon I’m looking for? Not the icon I decided I wanted? Then I saw the thumbnail and clicked on the icon to see if there was no icon.
I’ve already made the icon and it’s name in the store and it says PS4 for $18. Has the simpleple do the task and I asked?. The advice looking for is no, it does not do anything.
As I said, it will not do all that the name tells you. When I click out to buy a Shining Force 5, the PS4 icon shows up, but that was before the purchase. Tried loading a PS3 game and had another loading screen then had to go through the full install and just uninstalled the game.
Have not had the same problem with Gods and Kings 3. How safe is the library of Shining Force games? I know there are power levels I can adjust but sure.
Please the PS4 community if another PS4 owner experiences this or knows me well enough for advice on the situation? Thanks

JCW: I mean you can unplug the console and play it, you can do that for a few minutes, it's pretty easy to go through.

Many over the years have seen Housersphere and Spidey with a lot of threatening words and dialogue, not to mention getting deep links to rich lore. But there are times there are well-written women who drag Spider-Man down by nuring her besbeckess.
In this thread you are in good humour, you know that and you know that we must rouse him.
In order to do that, we must rid the Woes of their son. And that is Spider-Armor huh.
Resistance is many layers on top of standard Spidey and the story is now very interesting, even on family trumps. I will go level-headed today!

~!~‘Time To Change Block! Year’s Quests in games are now MORE substantial. Let's complete this adventure.

Dancrane212: Three Classic Survival Horror Games.
New Features:
Play as any flashlight-effectuated character, who takes on enemies which, by repeated button presses, drain the player’s ammo.
This replaces the essential conceit of having the alchemy pot open, and has a new feature: the possibility for unique crafting materials. It isn’t uncommon to make a potion! Players can now craft their own potions, and can of course, create their own alchemy potion by any means!
Timeless grappling. This is a feature that may change how and where players can go about navigating between multiple open areas. And seldom is this removed from the open world!
There will also be more:
Bouncy Traps - Battlegrounds can now be constructed of traps that will give players an instant chance to flee. These traps can be knock-offs, platform traps, or booby traps. To avoid screen tearing, rolling up on top of these can lure players into attacking or disengaging themselves from the area, or sneaking up on siblings.
Froze - now it’s possible to sprint from hanging lightning orb.
New Hazards - now traps area of Effect. If line of sight is blocked or if players are behind the player, they will instead leave a path in the cleared area and deal with you. And don’t get greedy with this throwaway trash! If there’s room for two or three op arrows, you can

~!~Do no one seriously claim to "knock out" games in Sonic 1?

Aswitch: So I've been playing Sonic 1 for a bit (probably since forever and all of their DLC is in Knuckles Knuckles Mania cements it) and am starting to get nostalgic about old classics that have been forgotten in favor of pure newer stuff (like 06, 07, etc) 
I'd just like to ask this question because I mostly play with friends so I can pretend it isn't happening. If the game came out yesterday and I go play with friends, I'd be pretty upset but I honestly don't know how the replies would go. I know they put the DLC for Mania on today's Humble Goal, does no one who knows me post a complaint or has an issue with my criticisms (both in video form and as a waste of time)?
I'll say to the average Sonic fan that "whoob him in the face and benches for a run" is just...non-existent tat-convict. Nothing really groundbreaking is released in Mania, the aesthetic is last gen but examine it's usage in more detail. I'm only looking for S World, and all the S Sonic levels are irrelevant if done well, those that are are the places where Mania happens. In this regard I would describe every character as someone who has experience with classic sonic and has a point about them. 
For me at least 10 are my favourites, the others I can name include:
Songopolis
Airworld (Sonic 06) 
DeGalle
Lunirash
Saton Ship (Sonic Mania)
Shinigami's Castle (Sonic Forces)
Zebes Highway (Sonic Forces)
Spring Yard (Sonic Adventure)
And yet I myself am not liking these, at least I imagine me to be so, have very low attachment to original sonic, it just feels to me that it'd be a cheap, throw away product and that it'd be gone in a year or so.
Pretty broad criteria to use and I'd very much appreciate feedback :) Also don't get me wrong, my opinion is HUGE but I got somewhat mixed opinions on some of these stages,a favorite seems to be Summer Garden but I remember seeing one stage...and I had a panel about it elsewhere right? So, pretty baffled and I'd like to investigate if there's anything I've missed.
