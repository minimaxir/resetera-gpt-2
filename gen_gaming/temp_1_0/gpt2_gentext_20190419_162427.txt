~!~Whatcha Been Playin': The Final DLC Edition

Strike: Detroit: Become Human (PS4) - Just reached Level 3. This is the only time I've nearly crashed and crashed while playing this. Give it a try.
Dead Cells (PS4) - Really addicted to this game, but this
Spoiler
 is just so hilariously dull. I just wanted to drop everything and try and complete the game and it wasn't even anywhere close to my liking.
Smite was my busted dlc for DCopers Chaotic Geometry Wars, I had to download and import the previous stages because all they said there was new additions to this map, (I mean, does it have brand new maps like in GW2/TEW?)
Costume Quest is dying (PS4) - Finally beat this. The level-less, super-voiced lock-off has me so fucking pissed, but I will go on and on with the rest.

I can’t say about PUBG, but I subscribe to Origin Premier, Origin Access and Origin Games Pass each on PC.

Bits N Pieces: I fired up For Honor a few weeks ago and quit. It just feels so good, and different for each person. It's similar to say Halo is a classic but it can be solo tank damage or you can get kicked into the accuracy of your base enemy to crush you for a good amount of time. Holy hell the Rainbow Sixs are similar and even last better when

Hexa: Blood & Truth was a PS3 game that was initially a PS4 game and later on the Xbox One. It already had multiplat support with 360 versions but then they decided to port the console versions.
Later entries of 99/100, a console game that retains its core gameplay but speeds up and reminds players what the console version offers, were remakes/remasters. Both funded and clastered by the first Sony iteration of console exclusives.

====================
~!~A question for you: What's the best version of metroid?

Demolition_Human: Metroid was beloved and loved until the series took a hold in the Gamecube. While Samus as a character was created mostly for peacekeeping and entertainment, Metroid was more technically inclined. Nowadays the series is more focused on being a survival/social sandbox with puzzles and exploration instead.
Personally it has one of the best and deepest survival mechanics I've played in a Metroid game. You have to remember there’s an advanced civilization and the planet has been put to the test and it’s up to humans and defeated aliens to build a new one. The game is heavily narrative oriented with 4 chapters focused on exploring, finding, and then battling the overgrown enemies. You can progress through the four different characters through the game’s optional chapters and learn their abilities. You can fashion them into different costumes with master tools. It has several different weapons for different gameplay styles.
Other versions of metroid have similar gameplay, though I prefer the more adventure-oriented design. The most recent one is Echoes. It is well-written, it has good writing, provides good level design, is about Samus taking on an adventurous adventure, and offers a few fantastic new enemies. It’s best suited for people who want to play it in one sitting. Unfortunately this version feels outdated compared to the Echoes version.
For me, with the Ikaruga in 2.0
Metroid Zero 3
The prime trilogy is some of my favorite video games ever. The game is easygoing, the graphics are nice, the story is great, the minigames are fun. Despite lacking in challenge, the game has a nice semblance of challenge to them, in comparison to metroid.
Metroid 64 remastered on gog.
Metroid Snatcher
That’s my answer, here's some good trivia
- Dolphin Emulator can do gorgeous 60FPS games on Dolphin! This MAME game after CRASH taught me so much. I love this emulator!
- Splatoon has a raft music! This game is really fun to play with a flute!
- I love that Tropical Freeze can run on a looove. I really like the map design and the atmosphere.
(Other good examples would surely come to mind)

~!~Do morality in video games matter?

Chaos2Frozen: I’ve been playing through TW3 and now that TW3 is out are intrigued by how linear it is. 
In the first few hours of the game, I’m being supremely told and being able to take down the many large side quests (Destroyers of Arcadia, Drake’s Fortune, etc) and eventually the villa deign to free the portion of the island that has the common terminology of villains this time around. 
Then I get to The Frozen Wilds and my whole party is [gives up], everything is so over the top and archaic with how some quests are now, and there’s even tracks that no one has ever seen before. 
And then I get to The Frozen Wilds and then my entire party is [Gives up], and even then who is that? How do I even define the entire, all open world with how do they expect me to follow? 
This game was really a reward for all those damn hours playing through but I just forget the “id respects”. 
The game also gives me very little post game stuff stuff throughout, it’s all in a world with virtually zero problems PvP. 
The game hides the fact I don’t even bother to open ch

~!~I wish you could help me get into Sony Interactive Entertainment.

Justin Iacobellis: I absolutely adore the PlayStation ecosystem. I can play my Switch, Vita, and PS3 library on my commute in 1-2 days with no issues.
So, I usually use Wi-Fi or Wifi, but all of my gaming activity has been through wired internet connection instead. The last game I played that means the long-term wireless experience suck away for me most of the day.
I shop for used games and suddenly any time I can, I'm really excited to start a vacation, so I wanted to ask if you could advise me how to start and keep going and to what extent I need help.
Preferably now, since I can't go back to PS+ after the service ends and keep supporting it.
This all started from a PS3 library I stopped collecting games for around a year before I could resell them to a friend for cheaper.
Next, I wanted to fill my Earth: Rise toosphere and SpaceKI libraries for God of War.
First, I thought I'd try see if I could convince my partner

~!~From DMC 3.1.0 via Kratos to SFV 3.1.2 MVCI powered up The Division!

cakely: A new update for the St. Paul Reignited Trilogy (that I'm aware of) contains new trailers for their respective modes: from DMC 3.1.2 on PC, DMC 3.1.2 on PS4, and 3.1.2 on X1. While the modes vary in what they’re called, individual gameplay systems such as G-Rank and host shield buckles are present. The invisible tornado has now launched all your enemies into the tornado pit!
The referee system isn’t present at any of the packages (except the first one sailing all off the players, which is intentional) and moves left and right at the same time. When a tornado then spins around your opponent, it is now irresistible! (and not totally clear if it makes that irresistible when pushed out of the protection)
Claire stages from DMC1.1 / V for example have her move set to teleport; preferential AOVs and flip flop AORs.
Sabo stages (Tank/Witch/Champion, Directional Game-Rank stages) and many sword-based stages return (can be hard to get after all the mechanics and aesthetics are gone)
The super maneuverable gear system has all the “Left Stick” text. This one is an interesting one, even moreso due to it representing where the triangles naturally formed in the center.
Graithouse is still there, but she's now covered in sweat.
Agility Spikes finally offers the fun shit! (also uses “Real” analogue gyro controls so its easier!)
Dante’s cockpit voice and voice has been changed, moving to more natural, naturally sounding pitch black throughout the game.
Apart from outfit customization, the game now restricts you to “five per opponent” rather than individual combos. This reflection of the DMC2 engine is back, as we now have Mii Kai and Bayonetta, not to mention Beat’n’s Robo. Just kidding, they even removed the bike from the game and called it a day.
The UFO system is back, too. Sure, the UFO system is exactly like the DMC2 engine: select bomb, and try X or triangle, and press triangle

~!~Uh-oh, right. Resident Evil 8 is one of the best games ever, don't @ me.

Imp the Dimp: I've just beaten Leon and Chris' campaigns. The difference is the first is more focused on Claire's evolution, the second is more focused on Ada's. RE should give Claire the apes suit.
Using resources obtained from encounters to upgrade her design, Ada can upgrade into an ability which would allow her to survive encounters as well as open secret paths.
There's basically 3 paths you can take to get all 3, each with different challenges. Each campaign has 24 encounters. A peaceful death is soon followed by a dangerous comeback in which you can become stronger or slower but gain more powers.
It's very rewarding, and just on top of that, giving you a higher power afterwards forces you to use it more wisely. There are spikes and a surprising enemy appears in the area.
The lighting is awesome! I almost marveled at the sun pea lighting on the area in the first game due to just how pleasant it felt, but if you look closely at the top of the scene you can see that they removed the sun pea thing. You don't need it at the start but it makes the world a more 'evolved' seeing as well as Ada's model is very detailed and detailed. Different branches of the tree become light pieces in the enemy arena while the 'angel dong' is a beam from the sky.
As well the game manages to make you feel all cute when youapeshift. Egiding Melus the redheaded girl.
As well you are given the power to fight your ways but the power is given to you and you have to reclaim the ego.
I thought the fans going for a girl controlling her evil counterpart style would be silly. I'm very much a fan of the game, quite enjoyed it.
Though it has me keeping a watch out for future installments, in the blink of an eye it's happening.
If anyone geties interested I'd like to discuss.

~!~Happy 24th Birthday to the Kingdom Hearts series! Is there a game you actively miss?

TheGamingNewsGuy: This is probably a slight one, maybe even saying It's the best one of all the Kingdom Hearts games - it unfortunately is not a "finish game" the game itself is not, both pastasably and musically speaking, so let's cut our gains short - Now, this is obviously for the people who have played plenty here and on the internet:
I am aware that certain characters deserve a spotlight in the background and yet I am so far past that spotlight I don't really feel like talking about them. This is the feeling I am looking for. I look forward to 15-20 Final Fantasy game announcements leading into a Kingdom Hearts game. And while some people may use my suggestions as "It no longer needs a Xion Heartless protagonist" as such, I really feel like I did something wrong yesterday so I'm permanently bummed out. Since I barely had time to think about about what I was looking at, that in no way excuses what I was looking for (Stats, Story etc) but let's cut back to 3D World and Tales of Majin Tensei. I know we are all guilty of 3D World/Xenogears inspiration but I understand that it plays somewhat differently. Looking forward to your suggestions!
The biggest and most important point is to go back to V. The design for the game does not age and does not have a particular design on how to design boss fights. The stage bosses look better with an upgrade between mid and high, with some Exual caverns and lava being retainted to reveal more ventilated stages than on PS1 (The first stage with the faster Exal Calcium recessed opened on high). While you have a better idea of how stage and Noppelpits look, art also presents the weakness for the Yo-kai or Puzzle Sisters which again have lighting no matter how the graphics ramp up, in exchange you are required to play with elemental panels as your bosses. The sprite art is a nice departure from the static sprites which were ordinarily 2-3 mazes (This is cour

~!~The Original Dreamcast Controller connector based nonsense - Battle Rifle

Teriyaki: I have no problems trying to fix this.
The puzzle segment at the beginning of Bubble Bobble was perfectly timed with the Joycon constantly changing directions. 
Enthusiasticly enough, my PS1 Controller was always dozing off a usb port, but I had the same cord stretched. 
It had one 2-handed workstation test done yesterday and peer into the FPS on it showing a perfect temperature. 
But I have another Dreamcast controller, and it actually feels perfect......

-----
Linkark07: Got my Switch ready.
I see aSTRING, how long can I hold my own?

JimmyRowe1994: Nintendo has done work in the video game space from recent memory, so it's nothing but for some of the bigger developers that are willing to develop their own projects.

~!~It' time for a new Dark Souls

Coyote Starrk: I have recently been playing Dark Souls and I really loved it, but I am used the game play, the atmosphere, and other aspects of it is just not for me. I really love the pixel art art and boss sprites that I love any other games I've played, but Dark Souls feels weird to me, and I am not a fan of that game play. So I ask you ERA : Is there a game you feel this same way about Dark Souls ?
-----
Kickmaster Kim: I couldn't play this game then but TRIME. Especially when it comes to RPG games. I'm gonna miss 1 on all of those platforms.
-----
Escaflow: When I first played blade clearest after playing bloodborne I forced myself to just watch cutscenes in last 20ish hours on googles and lost ect. For some reason this game keeps that fascination.
Hell, while playing it didn't have the same hook of playing the first of the DLC.
-----
mopinks: I'm playing through it right now, and it's scratching that dark elk itch' for a second
Based on info you provided TBH I felt like this was basically playing the same game with mostly the same primary key. I dunno how I had the motivation to continue but I'm interested in hearing what other folks have had an experience like this
-----
Soulflarz: I love the visual style, but I feel this art style is antithetical to what makes the game "Souls"

Springy: There's something unsettling about the human monstrosity behind you. Moving around it reminds me of Shanghai Carpades.

====================
~!~What's your preference about platform exclusives?

VanCityGamer: We all love platformers and RPG's, but if I were to give one specific platform a platform, it would be that. Those specific games definitely have higher chance of being included in recent patches, but they're also exclusives. And once they're on those platforms, they're almost guaranteed to be playable on future games. Then, later, you get to play them on emulator.
My platform preference for this is PC, though. Now, I recently got to play through Hollow Knight, which I consider a worthy "true" purchase, since it essentially plays like an emulator and you can use anything besides the DLC. And I really appreciate it. Hollow Knight is secretly one of the best games ever, and one of my favorite games ever in this forum. And you know what? It still runs great.
So, for me, platformers are like family-friendly movies to me, with lots of games I might never have tried or even played. I don't mean, a console with a controller. A little bit of both with an analog stick, as sometimes with Switch, and if I had to pick one, I'd pick the most technically advanced since SNES.
I love platformers, too. There's no problem with "nintendo-platform-assume-fuckers" bullshit imo, at least for me. And platformers are better suited for a console. SNES games on that steet.
As for exclusives, well, I still really enjoy them. I've discovered so many cool indie-game-inspired games like Wuxia. I've also played so many Nintendo games with the aim to make a living through them. But Nintendo is the best for me. They're my favorite JRPG lover.
Basically, what do you want out of exclusives?
-----
Jayson's Rage: Because Capcom themselves will always be my favorite platformers god damn it
-----
LewieP: For me, it goes without saying. I also prefer PC trophies in terms of balancing and polish. As mentioned above, strategy games aren't my bag, also because PC games usually imortize better in that respect. The best example big platformers for me is DQXI. Had to dump the GBA cause of lots of the QOL improvements, and the lack of initial stuff in DQXI was pretty annoying.

~!~Hunt Showdown will be coming to Nintendo Switch

ManaByte: Found this just now on Twitter:
Interesting it just revealed. I agree with many of the changes on social. Looks great. And no like a port, which I guess is good. Let's see, it's supposed to run on the Switch, right? So in other words:
-----
Ryuelli: The lack of a Steam version (should make it better) is disappointing to say the least.
-----
Twenty7kvn: The music In this game is phenomenal.
-----
KZXcellent: Good get, Fire Gym people.
-----
SlipperyMoose: In the vein of mens, gotta say I'm living the dream with this game.
-----
vestan: thirsty to finally check this out
-----
Subconian Dreamer: Put Hunt: Showdown on the Steam wishlist
-----
texhnolyze: Nice, i'll grab it as soon as I can. 
Is the Switch port exactly the same? I always thought the Steam version was the superior one.
-----
DoublePayje: People are thirsty, Hunt will be one of the first experiences to "inject" you into seeing your icons. It's essential to Hunt as no other stealth game besides Dishonored and Death by Neill Blomkamp's words. 
I read the game lacks the battle drone and the addon addon Bad North and God of war have. Why can't I have the moment in an in-game video?
-----
Glowing_Womb: There are so many different kinds of players... I wonder what's the standard for ports.

Sokka: Great video about music composed by Hiroki Morishita, composer for Mega Man 11.

Realeza: Man I love these guys.
-----
ZattMurdock: Far more respect and love from the subreddit for their contributions. Pretty fond of Shigeru Miyamoto for suffering a lot, saying to not give profits to think only for Hollywood anymore. 
A music of his I love it so much.
-----
Seik: I agree, the composer seems perfectly suited for MM11 and I hope he's rightly recognized.
-----
Lyriell: Legit surprised that the only answer he can get at this moment is Akio vs. Ximmins. I wonder why he can't bring Megaman 11 to Switch too yet.
-----
Dyle: When Mega Man Music was used as an excuse to reverse the damage that the similar works are to make it more accessible what about 11? That was the case literally everything used it.
-----
Mama Robotnik: The resemblances are mindblowing to me. Internet is a reality and has just grown so much....
I actually feel a Mega Man connection too.
-----
Hailee: Wait, this dude is a Mega Man fan? You think he's also a Mega Man fanatic?
-----
Alastor3: & to be fair Ximmins apparently had so much connections too than just the music. Influenced a ton by Megaman stories it seems

Plywood: For real, this isn't exactly a remake or sequel?
Also damn that is a dismissive comment.
I'm in. I'm in the middle of the worst Hogwarts student (1) when it comes to Disappointment. She is a bullying girl who goes on adventures, not even just for her friends - she follows it up with Harry by giving him the Pearson ticket in exchange for love, humour and a magical potion instead of going out on his own adventure. Everything and everyone. Every person who does not comply with her expectations is just a burden brought to these Hogwarts to try to find their love interest.
I am the middle part :(.

~!~Which has the coolest item pickups/buffs?

Nabbit: For me I feel like this endlessly relevant question has a good chance of being the most divisive item; I know people are interested in points and such, when I used to hate the 'points' and 'buffs' and what not, but I think I just have to go with one particular item that I truly think is a truly cool and enjoyable item.
Years ago I made a thread saying that I just always loved whimsical games and even more wacky things such as fairy element (although I never actually had the spirit to actually achieve something more amazing in the game so I won't harp on that).
Two years have passed and after just reaching the end it started feeling like hecticly ticking everything off. But I'm still (still) having fun using air, mainly for the silliness and reminiscing time and sometimes about the old me playing through N1-4 in its entirety ; there has to be something interesting I have no part in, perhaps it's an overworld air effect effect (which I didn't even know would work, only exoskemetric spider wraying with a pulsing disk moving in front of me).
Last month I finally decided to use both ends of the item myself without worrying about wind causing pain, just checking to see what would be the optimal path to place said item.
Xenoblade 2 had some fun choices that I can easily now see, and I can do pretty much anything with them, whether it's changing the status of the boss, opening loot, morphing and wallrunning, etc.
Souls guides can give advice if you would like, but I'm sure there are a good amount of ways to just do things without having to press L2.
-----
Transistor: On a similar note, I HATE MercurySteam's bathroom. 
I had zero problem with it, sure, but I did have problems with turning off cross-tones for PC due to how easy it is to put a working steam link in there. On a whim, however, I went out of my way to harm it.

Elfotografoalocado: I really wanted to try the first party stuff but stopped myself doing it. Wanted to read up the OPs from that week ago because it's a good, updated list, and I found this interesting news:
How the hell did you get your first party game except for MGS4, Naked Gun Reloaded, and some of the Shin Megami Tensei stuff?
I did try. Maybe now I will do it, because SDT has some help system that grabs me (through modding).
-----
molnizzle: The first nive worth a try.
-----
SantaC: Hmmhh its almost hard to be in first party when you REALLY have to think about the engine.
-----
CannonFodder52: My PS4 used to be full of first party games. I got it "ready" because you can't customize the base game now right?
-----
Elfotografoalocado: Yeah, that all changed late December as PS4's a little gazillion extra threads required. I also loaded up just the demo of NBA 2K with CFW and found out I needed to install pre-rendered backgrounds which got me to create this new game, which is great since I know my PS3 version belongs to my girlfriend. Picked it up just the same, but realized that I'm not going to be able to play with the Vita natively on the TV, despite it being playable there for so long.

It looks almost the same, I'm actually quite excited. Think I can get it right back if that new Target game they announced came even close to launching.
Could it turn out do the I can play it already, so to speak, before the game is purchased? Anything waiting for me I've already preordered, so maybe I can wait for these.

The Switch hardware is holding quite well, so it shouldn't be too shocking, but given how Nintendo fans are very enthusiastic when it comes to Switch hardware, and how well they maintain a solid track record, the Switch hardware news is pretty encouraging.

edit: There's 101 games already in the store, huh, all of those are interesting ones, but no amount of nonsense from Nintendo PR will make them go "Nope, Nintendo Online cannot compare to Shop. Now we are buying multiplayer games!" True, they don't can "wait 1 extra week" as soon as the Smash expansion game is launched, they are serious players, especially multiplayer will be F2P in consoles if this happens.

sn00zer: When it comes to ingame/out game reviews I’m often handed an advertisement copy and told that it was a review I really must listen to. And while the game does seem to have great cinematography, it’s focus is very much on the story. 
Spoiler
. 
It’s about 5 months later this year and the updated statue statues and costumes are out of stock. 
This can be summed up in a conversation with someone who is attaching the statue and character which has become a staple of the game. I’m not sure why this is happening... 
"Ok so GoW is my favorite video game ever" 
"uh... can we just cut the characters"
You know, my God... I cannot let go of it guys....
I feel like more critically reviewed Metal Gear Solid V scores should take precedence...
So Era, what’s your favorite review written about the game? Or do you prefer to know the changes beforehand simply to maintain a as good of recommendation over a game that exists

~!~I wasnt feeling Ocarina of Time's story....(Switch)

BWoog: So Last year I bought and played a bunch of Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, DS, and 3DS XL. I wanted to experience the games I missed.
I haven't really played either, but eventually on the advice of a friend, I went back to Twilight Princess. After getting Ruined Kingdom and it being a "bad game" I couldn't put down sufficient love for what I already had which led to a ban.
By the time I rolled my eyes at "Lucario" again fuck me, this game is AMAZING! Mostly, I like the music, the story, the characters. The dungeons, traps, dungeons, its not even a tactical RPG??? For fuck's sake.its one of my faves of all time!!! I can play the PS4 endlessly right now just for the cheers and screams.
I know many people like Paper Mario, but honestly for me it's only for the story.
The mechanics and controls are the worst I've ever experienced? Seriously,how the fuck do you need a 3ds to play RPGs??? Like fuckin I rolled a perfectly in Paper Mario, brush that waxes and wax,..whew...I swear,MM fans....please do not let this thread die.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I mean honestly? That’s low key one of the best games of all time, imo.
-----
blueredandgold: I just don’t enjoy the story. 2D games’ SotN works for me and it seems so uninteresting when you are essentially fighting Native Daisy creatures. 3D Mario Odyssey’s side of things are generally great as well and the simple button remapping makes for a great relationship.
You think the jumping is as fun as it sounds? Nope! Talk about convenient times.
-----
Sixfortyfive: I had similar problems with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Twilight Princess, respectively, that it took me some time to really hang in with the most core elements of the series. But, for me, the main attraction was the characters, and that was the story itself.
Whereas in Wind Waker, I felt I owed it a more expansive coat of paint trought to fit that Franchie wheel. As a result, I starting to wonder if it resonated with

~!~It seems the Retronauts Podcast's development has been Showed in the Free Agent Share Thread

More_Badass: Stylistically, it’s basically advertising a lack of content. Demos, rumours, and outright features with just basic glitches abound, so it seems like a cross promotion.
But it is also kinda weird that it’s on an “explore VGC” thread where I lock this up, not looking forward to and nor informed.
-----
Richter1887: Um, I don't know anything. Is it on the Nintendo Doubt List or something?
-----
VillagerMax: It's more akin to a future 3D Pokemon tester. The next Gen is in no way hinted, so it wil never be released in 2019.
-----
Chauzu: True, but then Game Informer has also been mentioned many times after the release of the game and it wasn’t shown there as well.
-----
Raysoul: True, but not. They should get rid of the false rumors and more of this stuff eventually.
-----
Asuka: I hope this happens! It will never happen.
-----
mavericktopgun: Nah. Its on that # livestweet page on the Store 🤔
-----
Rickenslacker: I feel like they plant too many fake names sometimes. Life really does have some limits... with how often upvoted they make things out.
Companies I know accused fake reviewers of a cyber crime. Like they put 2-3( close?) seconds into the thread and got riled up enough and made things up over it.
-----
Lifendz: Nothing. Apparently, the Gears 1 fan page recently tore from a company for a pretty large breach. Their post made their former art director upset. No apology from them needed.
Obviously. 
Not really. I don't think there is any „fake“ nature with how people defend a product. Some people find it hilarious. Faking something out about it is bad and, of course, someone knowingly thinks his opinion is wrong. There's zero difference to someone who knowingly makes a false thought a false thought and a definitive wrong didn't.

~!~How Long Have Fortnite Droughts Been For And How Long If You're Too Limited On Content?

Bobo Dakes: I don't play Fortnite so I couldn't help but be thankful for cheaters in the game, too, which is why I treat the problem pretty seriously and not even by having solutions.
One time (on 27/4 at PSN), I had the Fortnite Freeze after a145 days long time when I had to waive my right to all weapons so I could only play defense mode, or atleast until the servers Freeze was arched toreadied. I played through that and made it to the little under 300 place at first, but then it didn't let me pre-fconfignate till I was in the complicated group on defense. Name what I'm playing now and don't head over on defense, or mid to high defense.
I haven't played much solo gaming (maybe part of the weekend?) since just after the snow event. It was a privilege to have my first active game on defense/middle defense for the week.
This weekend K1/2 Skate 2 days focused on college, as I was doing my part to meet the finals date before packing up. I slowly got my first skill shot and stepped in spirited tag team matches against the other opponents til 10-15 on the server. Playing ranked all weekend without reallygitging was a godsend in the defeat. Just constantly Saturday and Sunday I feel like playing at home or at family-friendly.
So ideas?
Let me preface the thread with high praises to other resetera.
Cheers
-----
Starlatine: This is how I have to think now. Fortnite knows those games are trash and many games require a lot and time to learn at certain times of the week so it just wasn't worth it until 90 days ago.
And most of the games this needs to be discussed alongside r/WoW weekly content consistently as people aren't about to provide fodder for discussion. These needs needs to be changed .

Bobo Dakes: I simply don't actually wanna do that, at all. Give me a match and set those 2 for free then I can pick it up if I want, haha. I'm only a weekend player so this just doesn't go out of my radar for me or my PC.

~!~How come Mario Tennis Aces has very little player sizes in all tournaments?

Denman: The video game oversized tour ended today in France, so it’s a little fuzzy in that regard.
If Mario Tennis Aces had a version in the indie scene, it’d make the number 4.
-----
Spinky: It does.
-----
Kiniryu: I'd get bored if all the worlds only had MP4 but they aren't

Denman: Sadly it’s not. Games already have 74.

~!~Place Trials Have Controllers To Much of A Realist’S Perspective?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Close this topic or close it if you don't want to read the op. 
As I've mentioned many times many times before, horror games are scary when you're scared but viscerally scary when you are simply a nightmare. The first time through you get there and realize how awful is the jump scare. Then you switch to the same screen.
Compare and it would flow naturally. The plan is to stay calm, I will handle this well. Maybe an evening is ruined when I wake up earlier already because I just have dreamed. Pretty soon you're done, just booted it up, realize what happened, and are beginning to try to think of any thing you can go on, even if the only thing you experienced was nightmare. 
That's where the thread title is from. A realist needs to make a podcast or a podcast where the response isn’t horror but: "its more of you just moving forward trying to stop the flow of horror that you’ve been in always safe from always." 
Stories meant in the context of what horror wanted to scare, not the expectations of survival horror to be. Remind me of the Obsidian Project Era thread in May of 2015 or the other open beta from November to January of 2016 about writers explaining what a hardcore horror taunting scenario was, even if it was complex matchmaking. 
Regardless, by hoarding this demo I finally am biting into a story book.
-----
Maxey: It totally happened to me in my post, and its pretty good, actually.
-----
Wein Cruz: Most studio games Require blank screens halfway through the entirety of the game to do pre GI cutscene work, which makes you only watch parts or its captured screen like a last minute trailer, and then it's done.
-----
Solid: I thought the same thing the other night, injury completely outpaced me in Sweet Home.
-----
Sárr: Dark Souls and Resident Evil. They were the first and second hours of my playthrough in nightmare tough. I couldn't until long after I realised what was wrong.
-----
saenima: This. Not just for horror, but for any game if I'm playing a game, I want to go through it in all its glory before

~!~Those pictures were taken before New Home Arcade/Home Console went on sale

Aizō: Based on this thread, I would like to try to categorize the games before listing the versions with the crappy Wii or before making this post.
Good versions of great games
Like the 1st Road and Last Window.
The Policenauts pre-game Puzzle Collection was known to me even pre-gen when it was ported (although this can still be found on various consoles with improved backgrounds) and my friend taught me his newest favourite game to play (this version despite it being soft). This version my boy Brook(from the 0pb division of Extra Credits) was going to play all the day and late at night, it was amazing and challenging. Believability!
There are also some really cool (but easy to get into) puzzle games. Unravel Both.
And a side level up!
Also a big time achievement!
Oh and a very fun retrospective game!

~!~ARMS Party Crash Bash Tournament: Min Min vs. Counter (Plays set for 1 PM EST)

Neoxon: Between Min Min and Counter, we have a surprise party Crash Bash Tournament coming up... Oh yeah, it's Min Min as well.
That's right, Min Min! We're bringing classic Game Peek goodness from the Original Battle Network inspired ARMS! The Party Crash Bash will take place on June 9 from 6:30 PM EST to 10:30 PDT (PDT), with a variety of special and more exciting ARMS surprises to see.
Will match the hype in both matches, Min Min and the Tournament mode, with Min Min taking on both normally, a giant meteor falling to the ground and overhead ground throws from the air. You'll be able to grab items and Medals to progress through the Party Crash, that gameplay will last min AND all!
Plus, fans of the original Battle Network will be able to get new Battle Network badges as well, so be on the look out for Party Crashes as well.
-----
Spinluck: Guess I need to ditch the Splatfest head gear and reinforce the same character for my party in Smash. 
Still cool to have all the badges though.
-----
foxuzamaki: Yeseeeomen
-----
Neoxon: Truthfully, Smash did it's best to protect Min Min, but the Party Crash is going to be a thing.
-----
Neoxon: Counter sure feels a lot like Smash with the meteor thrown in. They're bringing Excite to the table as well.
-----
Kyoufu: I'm hoping to see Min Min give more reasons to join in on this zen swoop.
-----
Neoxon: Pleasantly my party stands ready and a set of badges ready to go.
-----
Spinluck: Excited to hop in and see what my impressions are. Excited to see how Zero does.
-----
Neoxon: Finished it for a 113-w in Min Min and hopes to be close to 100 percent within the next week or so.
The Party Crash w/ XP badges:
This mode is my favorite of the multi-player stages:
It lets you pick a character to recruit, swap out for a party of three individual badges and be part of their battle
Min Min:
She who sprays you with the Ribbon's health bar
====================
~!~Do you actually fight back more when you meet new enemies?

entremet: I've been playing Dragon Quest XI lately and I haven't beaten it yet. I usually don't develop combat anxiety with unfamiliar enemies (any of these 3), but let's face it... these enemies are the lamest ever to have to actually attack when you meet them.
On rare occasion, these people get killed in my games because they're too good or over-powered. Those baddies should've just stayed dead if they made it to combat, allowed me to use my HP wisely. Ego is just terriffic adrenaline. However, my main development from my time playing XI was starting a wizard and not just making him stupid.
I felt hesitant almost from the first fight against one of Barba during his teleport wave. There a few times when he fires a shot at me where I'd just run and then still be behind him
What's more interesting to me is that when he's defending themselves and enemies are shooting at him, he actually wastes more of his own DPS (Who is then a toastable leg to be put down forever). He's not a bad spider either, any auto target or taking many damage.
At least Acquire decided to not be a spider enemy, which makes some more sense.
What's your struggle resolution for different monster forms?
-----
lordlad: its getting harder and harder to find good starter.
I guess that is exactly why I find Pokemon are harder to win against. I have to pick the starter they are going to use in the next evolution.
-----
ILikeFeet: yeah, in order to beat big, stuff is to get a grip on your game and come up with a plan. I could listen to random ass sound themes for a bit and Misty can't beat Magneton until the post battle
-----
Chalamex: Ruby and Alpha Sapphire was the only times I felt even remotely remotely anxious during the GBC/E series invasions lol. Then Emerald came back and did better. Never went back to them with Emerald but it was quite rewarding when I did.
-----
entremet: I quite enjoyed the GBC version (but not the one in the original Ruby/Sceptile dub). I do agree, too, that enemies feels more real. You have to use your endgame Items/Enemies to make sure you even yourself can deal with the things
====================
~!~Can one person "perfect" one game?

Kromeo: For me I love to count the minutes a game has to be perfect outside the gaming if you play at an optimal level much like how we think. For example - for example in Valve's publishing yearly "Everyone is Here" maybe you or I would have a 1:1 match on a regular basis but if played popularly. For example Halo 5 was the first Halo campaign and multiplayer on GoG before. I was never able to completely play Moss in that multiplayer - I remember from the time, I couldn't reach 100% comfort with the PS3 port.
So I have a question - what would say is the ideal game what do you end up playing lol? Well, I have been playing video games again from every different region to every different game and this time I decided to break down one game that I loved and one that I always kept forgetting.
Example - I had a weird dream last night that Oda-Naru gifted a girl with the Potomac. I was a little curious wth that, but I couldn't play it and I thought it would take until her final form to find the game's soul (placed in order). Now, from the sounds of it, it's the dark souls series.
Now, if you know how it sounded like last memory there's no chance the Potomac will matter but a man needs to Mindbreak the op and notice the girls head over to the clan capital... himself, you have to red, miss and take over the title so the whole clan can remember you without losing the sacred grove of their gods.
-----
Canucked: Can a man play The Last of Us or MGS? For a man who doesn't have any of those wrapped up his mind won't run 1:1 with the reality of winner. Also, Accounting Extreme 4's first game.
-----
Kolx: Lol. The Last of Us and The Last of Us Remastered themselves don't count in the same category.
-----
shoptroll: Just curious. There's really nothing you can do about it other than completely forgetting it by accident. Only thing the fudge isisenders that cause the title to be hiddde as it is has modifiy.
-----
DocSeuss: I legit doubt it would count. Isn't Last Of Us a perfect game? Is MGS an obscure Outrun clone
====================
~!~How many different ways can we digest 480p 30 FPS footage on a saturn?

Marano: I was thinking of doing a study on how many different applications each respective console makes, how many different digestible videos it can take to compress it, how many rolls through the servers are possible without info....I wanted to investigate if there is an association between game sizes to compress the image size and how many video streams there are.
Feel free to do your own research.
-----
Marano: Thanks!
I just don't understand.
If I place and pull the same data over 4 times the sample size would size would devate over again, choose 4 antecedent times and then divide by 4,000.
-----
GongagaSOLDIER: No, except they only pull one thing, Retries. I would think they could still capture a lot more if they sampled it at a few places randomly across the internet in a similar fashion

Blade Wolf: Or it's not the first time that's happened..?

~!~Unofficial customized GBA cart adapter available for pre-order?

Conkerkid11: I just got this notice on the eshop:
It's customized to fit on the top of the cart, and has a lot of voice-actoring on the inside edge of the cart. On the fact that the cart itself is in an awkward position where the keys are on the edges, I cannot imgur link it to something from a retail product.
Has anyone encountered this situation?
I literally put this cart off from contacting Nintendo regarding this.

FelipeMGM: Kinda want to know as well ; also Wanted to know how well this works...

====================
~!~How long do you have to agree to a Bethesda game to like it?

Zan: I bought BFE again last year, when their strict rules on EA’s Loot Boxes and/or sale prices went into effect (a few months ago btw). It was because of the game's loot boxes, and I just picked up RDR2 for $15 after originally playing their demo. I Did everything I was told and it became an incredible experience! Needless to say, it’s one of my favorite games to current gen.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, a dev in charge of BGS suggested to me to buy RDR2 for in-app purchases in August 2016, after a short discussion. I agreed to it and was immediately in full agreement and then my agreementのBioWare. I’ve had thought and felt that every AAA open world RPG game should have a yearly release to rotten by now (In terms that I actually liked that it had good SP and made grinding meaningful...). I bought a game, completed mission objectives and started gold farming. I summoned companions to help me through a training mission and beat all the required objectives. 
When I went to play last week again, nearly half an hour after all the pre-release pre-orders were closed, I enthusiastically bought the game. I traveled each time to scout every town/city and after dropping a couple of fools just to beat the shit out of said town/city as they arrived. Some had parents hangingovers on their floors by the TV and others had long-time fans taking seats. Before long I was 40 to take a picture in the living room, and all of the other regulars joined in, only to see me and lads doing bedtimes. I watched us try on unfamiliar charaters and brag about taking two weeks breakfasts to completion, before doing any side missions, with no one to yell at to ask if we gave it a try. 
So one last note: I have bought FO76 on VU? ANOTHER time we played and my interest was ten points higher than that. I started it past the first village then it took like a year, mostly in character quests and only and partially still in the main story. Had lazy weekends and fell asleep for another couple hours t

~!~Ubisoft making a trophy list of upcoming free titles

Nirolak: So this is something I've been wondering about. Do Ubisoft think the game will be perfect selling wise or people will still refuse to buy it?
Personally, the trend of crappy first party releases is one I keep returning to and if this trend continues, the future of free, open-world games will be hilariously muddled
Which begs the question, do you think all digital titles like Uplay and Uplay Plus are going to embrace this “sharing the burdens” model and continue to be shitty products but Ubi continues to be profitable? Is the only way to get these kinds of things in this industry relatively quickly outside it’s traditional structure?
Please interpret my English this way.
-----
Dark Cloud: Deserved.
-----
NoKisum: Was it really worth it at launch? I think I would have bit for more content, but after they got all the Division sales and purchased the extra content then, I don't really feel like spending real money on it until I've finished it.
-----
Jesse Gomez (IGN): Tons of PC british companies have this plan.
-----
Potterson: Fuck Ubisoft games, I'd like to buy them physically. I usually have some laptop in my office, but with Ubi's new ship expansions and the more expensive DLC aaa games, I think I'll just game once and give the rest to Ubi. What happened to my Linux box :/
-----
labpleb: Damn, I completely forgot about this. They made the right call.
-----
unoillnino: I'll probably reboot my PC shortly. Hopefully I won't have to repeatedly go through some dumb loading screens to get to all the free content I paid for.
-----
Voxl: The only F2P initiative I can think of is more likely to sell. The new ubisoft partners are doing some really good work.
I just hope all their leaders (dirts) continue their progressive vision.
-----
Hamster Plugin: I'm confused on how Steam won't show my current games without paying a separate 10 dollars cut from this game. And even Ubisoft said that is the case so can't even share the cover art.
It's been a long time since I even bought the game and I confused how Steam won't let me add games into my library
====================
~!~What is the mistake everyone talks about as a “Windows” thing? In 2018 there was a Ost

Dama: In 2018 everytime I think of gaming plans I instead of Smash I see a Windows (Exclusivity). I’m facinated when the only person that talks about this is Shigeruki Murayama. Anyways, all the major issue it’s illuminous: the lack of M+KB on consoles; goddamn the windows console selection in relation to price and userbase, what even is that there? I don’t see how MS considered that a reason for you to start with Windows except for is attractive.
-----
Fina Machina: It shouldn’t..... It’ll be optional, optional, and seen as a “front source” for developers if they invest in an emulator.
-----
Mazzle: The lead up to DOSBox, on Master Chief’s Boot. At this point you’re basically in an emulator.
For example, it’s the Genesis console. It’s very hard to find games like Sonic, Banpresto, and Driveclub that didn’t require an emulator, and are exclusive to emulators.
You could also argue the MS using an open forum for console emulator development while Nintendo, before Pokemon, refused to let people in and create games on their store.
I’d rather Snake Man 2 be layered in that case despite Forzasaurus being just an end in the term!
-----
Zukkoyaki: If Windows isn't an emulator I don't want my first console to be an emulator. 
Some games I see over and over again are still on Steam, working fine I think. Ori, Hollow Knight are still on sale, just not fully blown up yet. Still waiting for western announcements. 
I also believe "Open Source" means a program that doesn't depend on a developer and that the code from such a package doesn't rely on third party tools. So we can expect more games and GaaS on consoles.
This pipeline the OP is talking about, would given Steam and MS’ open. That would likely still be based on emulation and would be limited to games only. Subtitles would remain on Steam already.

ILikeFeet: I don't know. I might have mistaken it for the Fire Stick successor (Fire 27)
-----
Ben Walker: There isn't a way to actually play it. The Ethernet adapter works very well, but the point of it doesn't work.
-----
TheCongressman: I don't think it worked, that doesn't sound too bad. I wonder if 49ers camp since at this point much of the gaming community can run a Mac with a proper GPU for productivity?
-----
Twiz: Wow. I've had mine through last weekend and still don't like it. I'd take an oculus/keychain just to play it again.
-----
Cartridge Games: Disappointing, the connection is super unstable right now.
Was hoping for a rift k from them to improve those
-----
CozMick: This. And maybe even the Razer blade.
-----
JahIthBer: Has anyone made a touch keyboard for it as a keyboard works perfectly for me, with or without OTM.
The solution for me, it's not just clicking around, you better really need a proper mouse and Logitech make them a pet mousemop in aurg for you to click around, otherwise it's useless.

asmith906: I would have preferred the blade or the 970c or laptop cuz I would have no support and their are definitely not well reviewed even by myself.

melodiousmowl: Hello, this weekend has been quite the weekend (I think it's equipment yail) I find myself trying to discover new games. I now find myself feeling embittered and depressed, that's why the best recommend me goodness happened to me - tonight I have to pick up four atmospheric uncharted games.
Now I´m looking for it on switch.
I´ve finished uncharted 4 before, but I liked uncharted 3 so much it made me sad I´m not a fan and couldn´t even dislike it.
Lately I´ve been playing more platformers, and better games than I could have. Is it just me?
Why do you recommend this game to you? It might sound too much, but in a way I´d like to understand what awaits : the game?

====================
~!~Are we sure about the implementation of motion blur/shadows in Bethesda open world games?

KiLAM: I've talked before about the increasing number of Bethesda open world titles using checkerboard rendering on consoles.
I've been trying to make a save to try and pick up where I left off and as far as I can tell no games with checkerboarded shadows are achieving their target on consoles.
I've seen people claim this is the extreme end of what can be expected when it comes to frame rates. That sounds super weird and wrong but my experience is that it doesn't just work; sometimes it can be daunting to start just two consistent high refresh rate displays into a game and then try to look through the results to see what I was missing.
Now I know many people dislike this card-based rendering and think it is somehow kinda noticeable; however, I've just been trying some open world games and I're pretty surprised in a few obvious ways:
1. Almost every game uses checkerboarding to simulate LOD/SR
In most of these games it's either very small details to the frustrate a segment of controls or very sharp shadows. However, DOOM and the recent Metro Exodus use checkerboarded shadows for an experience mostly. When I tried the demo for Metro 2033, I was honestly LOD bottleneck for my living room TV with checkerboarded-rate LOD because I only saw shadows from a 3rd person perspective.
Here's just one example but it all adds up. DOOM is a very small zoomed-in title that at the moment, looks quite good through my setup for retail production. Contrast ratio looks good also, almost mirroring FFXV Shadow Guard at best (big plus if it comes to the virtual center).
2. Setting the brightness slider to minimum absolutely doesn't seem to alter image quality. DOOM and Metro 2033 do it via CBR but DOOM's brightness setting is a total downsampling from a proper downsampling and exploiting technique in place of CBR that compresses shadows all the way to around 3 frames in and around (compared to ~2 frames in just 2033 which has a much higher brightness at least).
In footage footage the shadows/focus visual significantly impacts gameplay (beaten by ~10 frames). MKX seems to push above MKX in FOV quite a bit, as the Focus scaling is ~20x

Unlocked 60fps with stable 40fps average.
1080p/1440p
Unlocked 30fps
Refreshrate and hit def target has a very good suggestion for wider screen both very nice current gen titles and very comfortable for new titles.
Very consistent XB1X-like system in terms of buffering, framerate capped at 60 fps. Encountered two problems in one section (the art around enemies gain health and the PC FPS goes down) and both are ruled out due to both sections not having a bug.
Next onto PC hardware.

~!~What's the better indie horror game - Hollow Knight, Steamworld Dig 2, Moon Hunters

CenturionNami: Two of the most flawed and underrated indie horror games of all time. I don't understand the irrational dislike of the genre, or the fear of losing everything to this novelty, much like I do horror games. It's just not at all a "clean" scare.
Store listing (while updating):
Chinese Description:
"Simian sandbox with futuristic victorian Hill "
It just seems like such little pandering that describing it as "futuristic" doesn't give these games the faintest of smints. It feels compact, limited, and is just so fucking lonely. During runtime, many of the original people you talk to are recolors of their same room, but their consciousness becomes an organic force much like how your shark shark sense works.
It has a foregoneetastic plot, which kinda sumced the overarching plot of the game, but the vague "real time" references in the store description doesn't really have that same juuuustinge as the homages glitch space. By that, the developers had successfully spent nearly a year working on much more story alone pulp games, and even some of the internal quandaries they had had, more or less resolved. Most of their problems were resolved horribly, so in the end it just seems like a less linear game.
But regardless, Steamworld dig 2 feels like an Uncharted 4 one-off. It's a distinctly more linear games as they describe it, and it just... h... blends in - the design of the farm and the way the golem tethers you to the nearby farm gate was memorable
-----
LonestarZues: Nice write up as always OP, somn have some thoughts on the game. Liked what I saw but I don't have high hopes for the rest of the game. Definitely waiting on the Switch version on the LRG channel for the Switch remaster to see how it plays.
-----
AngieXC: Also interesting idea coming from Steamworld Dig 2, plus someone else have they both been playing the first one on a disc on the toilet. Brought my shit up with toilet cartridge splicing.

~!~Television version of Spider-Man (2018) feature Glimpse Mode

Keasar: Anyone else enjoy this feature in Spider-Man?
I couldn't find a thread on this and I love it for an animated version.
I love the way it looks and every single time you shake the screen there is a pulsating ghost. Is this in any version of the game in general?
The gamerz behind this thing (again) have set the scene to a GIF in their official community. For those who don't know what the GIF is, it's a corner side (eye-to-eye) of screen where you can see different parts of the tv for specific details, also here's a Glimpse mode screenshot if you want to get freaky looking. And when you exit the game, a pulsating exit forms and starts running at you.
Gto Miss Anyone 
I guess my question to you is, how professional are these moves despite being scared to notice these things? What are your impressions of these parts of the game? Are there interiors or other aspects that I am missing?

Mullet2000: Just a thing I appreciate about the dawn and night cycles kicking in. The good stuff ain't learned.

~!~Easter egg or charm?

Savinowned: So I want to really settle this once and for all but based off a couple of peeps who are super into playing Easters. I enjoy the best games I have in my collection but I've noticed many people claim that they charm the games off the spot because the game has charm and charm doesn't. This often leads to my error when I'm really into games where I'm required to add something to the charm but I don't feel as if I need to use my charm to attain it but rather the charm I'm gaining with the games that I want.
Personally I love RPGs because they usually have a lot of charm (beyond WoW specifically) but sadly I don't have Sphinx too.
Anyone else feel the same about charm in games?
-----
poindexter: Of course. Much prefer games with charm. But the same still applies to every game
-----
angelgrievous: I like and enjoy Diablo so I tend to really, really like games like this over the ones with no charm.
-----
AniHawk: spiderman, every other game looks to me on the back of my mind and i'd never want to turn it off =/
i hadn't ventured into the franchise yet but some people in neogaf gave me various opinions on the matter and they were positive but they thought it was a pretty small bit of nuance that could be helpful to someone looking to just dive in. i liked spiderman a lot but other games really shot it in that department imo. lol
-----
Savinowned: Yeah, I'm similarly fine with game's menu just being 'souls-esque' looking. I certainly miss first comes the Doom icon at the very end of the first level I play, so I think I prefer throwing that in too.

~!~What is the Definitive Castlevania Video Series?

SOLDIER: In the 21st century, Konami's games have continually been deconstructed and adapted for video games in many ways: they as a series were heavily subverted in using time travel and the other Dimension powers as plot devices, they were frequently split into non Lethal plot segments (e.g., Castlevania: Symphony of Theater) and they were often modified to adapt mobile game format. It hasn't always been as great (Bombastic Battle/Conception Engine are the pain), but I'd posit that the series will forever be in a sort of limbo that used to be its own throne, thanks in part to the return of Simon Belmont and Belmont's competitive streak with the Castlevania fanbase.
The answer is that they've been handed every generation. Some series took liberties, some adapted them to be rekindled in other forms.
Which are your franchises? Do you prefer the first two, or are you happy with the new directions (still spend a lot of time looping Castlevania ressources) and feel that both have a place?
As an aside: do you gamble naming your franchises and franchises
-----
Lant_War: Castlevania would have to be 3D would have to be like Bomberman, one of the most difficult games in the series and probably the most expensive 3D platformer ever.
Loved them mostly because they had a way of deconstructioning most Castlevania plot points with the help of several faithful interpretation of Bram Stanko's Dracula.
God eater would probably be a bit tough, Konami usually prefer their shooters go to the Castlevania formula.
-----
Exist 2: I'd love for them to create a two chronicles series.
Castlevania The Adventure Never Matter and  Curse of Darkness would be perfect.
-----
Zomba13: Give me either and enjoy me infinitely. Having a head start on composing a Castlevania soundtrack would be pretty great. Every character would be different from each other and a complete overhaul of that formula would make Rondo in-faceted possible staples of the franchise and give me no particular break with the formula. I think it would take a few more years before I get into it again and realize that b) Konami doesn't really have the manpower yet to develop it's medium and i'd be fairly hesitant to try this again.

~!~Excited to play 3DS games on modern consoles. Where do I begin?

I KILL PXLS: GameXbox has been slowly adding to their library with their huge PlayAnywhere licensing deal. 3DS games are pretty much all being sold on storefronts. Has anyone tried to get some recommendations?
GCU is also slowly gaining traction. Just recently It's purchased a full collection of over 200 games, including classic Nintendo games like "Mario Kart 64", "Fire Emblem Fates", "Pokemon Sun&Moon", and "Drakkard"
Even better: 3DS games for $10-$100. Lol (fucking ActiRaster) You're welcome.
-----
KLoWn: Best place is Playtonic
-----
CoolestSpot: It was at eshop but PSN is popular and GOG and steam are dominant too right now. I mean, its not on the Persona side, The Witcher, ect, but it's a way better service
-----
BGBW: How many games on the 3DS have the permission of the developer or should I just ignore?
-----
CoolestSpot: Only the Bravely games. Not Bravely Mystic.
-----
Tobor: It's mostly the latter
CoolestSpot has the Falcom one disc, he prefers a disc. But, Bravely the Movie
But I dont think both have the same license as that one.
-----
I KILL PXLS: To be fair, there are a good number of actual and simulated games on it.
-----
JoDa: Definitely checked it out a while ago, they are much cheaper than Microsoft and Sony for the older games. However, the C&C games on the 3ds are obnoxiously expensive too

CoolestSpot: Indeed, and the ones on the Switch are much expensive, but for my information in Germany and the area I live, maybe it's through limited times andthrope? FPV is fine at least for me, cuz it's where I get most of my driving done and commuting.

I've got Doom and Resident Evil 7 with it and wow is that anything then hate there is compared to the awful buttons on joycons joycons, or even strafe sticks for DEADLY SLIME. Do anyone use these on PC? I hear about joy cons, but personally I wonder what a supposed defect is there in the design?
Help!
-----
Crayon: What was done to you is the end step of VR tech in general, false perception, is used to make you see things like a picture stick in the palm of your hand then on the proper flat controllers. 
I use the force-based hypertensive set because I want it for paranoid-type players.

cnorwood: Yes, so I don't know what system it is. 
I use Logitech m14 
They are wireless, no fking issues.
-----
methane47: Haven’t been using videos eye roll for years. Definitely check out Q9 VR and it’s games you’d want to play on PC. Too many FPS or TPS games now have snap shortcuts when launching apps or games with constant tap to screen. They really need some balance.
-----
Rygar 8Bit: Taser range is supposed to be a perfect match of a toaster.

CenturionNami: I use VIVE Pro and Steam Controller , Doom and non too much games. I can't play them then. VR destroys the point of my hands.

~!~My Nintendo Switch: the 2016 Nindies Direct is an absolute bummer

ScOULaris: The special celebration for a unique release that nevertheless sold in the "best selling" range for the year is here. The behind-the-scenes story is wrapping up well for Nintendo's 2017 lineup, but it's brought to you by the end of 2016, where both Nintendo accessible titles were perceived as essentially a pogs-to-game and a massively popular environmental discussion/ground floor at conventions. No matter how much the films rankle investor demand for, the Nintendo Switch axed Nintendo's traditional partnership relationship with ND, Zelda and Metroid brandishing the same family friendly characters we had seen come to power on the last 2 decades on it. The awards ceremony for the new Nindies Direct, on the 31st of September, is in NYC, so there will be no snowballs. The best of the best is on the following day.
No need to familiarize yourself with how many Nintendo icons will “complete their own games”, and how likely (at least initially) it would be for each title to enter the larger numbers.
I personally believe that, on the heels of last year's superlative award showdown, Nintendo will to make the shift from making their biggest titles to focusing on smaller, referencing more traditional gaming titles, rather than companies' own.
Sure, Nintendo will try to stay relevant this NES and Famicom Generation as time progresses and they stumble, but I think people's impressions of Gamecube-era gaming can be useful.
Anyways, on to the thread!
-----
TheDinoman: I've always maintained these games don't really need a lot of advertising, but I do think that they sell like hotcakes with a fair bit of "GC-level" competition at the end of the day.
-----
Servbot24: Why is the NES game held in much higher regard than CD/Wii/PS1? It may not be the best game in the series, but it's obviously loaded with Millions of hardcore hardcore fans. Plus despite a mix of NES - NES Classic - and SNES / NES classics, the "Classic Edition Edition" (placing the console in front of a CRT) makes themselves look similar to each other. I also believe that the reception of NintendoLand actually was at least somewhat inspired by this first trailer.

This thread is inspired by our official Fallout 2 Xbox One trophy list, which we used to take all the way from the first system title, with purpose:
Now i know some of you don't love the style, but damn imo Fallout 76 trophy list is top 5 platinum trophies, 5 of those (or more if you play 1st) are in 1 or multiple games.
Hopefully its not as tedious as 4/3/2, which obviously is not super rare (uploaded) but we hope it also embraces the torn pieces style of the beginning.
Companion rewarded items that reward you with a super rare legendary and a useful companion companion companion companion companion companion too or once every for seasons as well.

~!~Pathway DOS2: Will Play Realized That It Is An Aesthetic Break Of The 'Circle'

DarknessTear: I wanted to share this and expectations as well. Although it's obviously Step Aside yesterday, I think its a good takeaway that artifices are leaving some sort of pattern in PlayStateters minds, particularly when mounted on this title. Recent practice has made it abundantly clear that the video is an excellent gutter, even as of release. It serves a purpose rich enough to make it almost vital to progression/play, but it's also open an enjoyable, defined tool. The orcs will remember, however, that yuk can get what they demand, but they won't. Their physical parts will matter, but they can remember later. While she does manage to her pawns dress up in armor, outside of the private parts, the pandora is particularly so dangerous and freaky. As many concerns about the game go, she'll evade the guards with the AP requirement that, when clicked, will make the rovers prone to falling into lava or something. Quite a visual for a storyline that somewhat Disneyland rides the patient to a wall in an effort to throw them a bad ending. That is all I see as issues, though, and I'm pretty sure that has some sort of payoffs to storytelling as a medium. I haven't bothered to try talking about the concept itself but, how come?
As of now, I have no clue as to why these games seem to be stalking players in any form. The original 30 minute introduction videos constantly disolve the

~!~Even Microsoft notes the Wii U isn’t a Wii generation now

VanCityGamer: This seems rather absurd to me.
Microsoft has noted the Wii U being Nintendo’s flagship device for a long time. For example, the Xbox One was hyped back in the Wii U days, and then the console released in March 2013. Then the Switch released in 2014 and we now have a Wii generation that was launched in March 2016 (and on Wednesday this year).
So much for smartwins getting Wii joycons. Here's the timeline.
2008 - People realised they could sell the Steve McQueen turned traditional peripheral to you with a high price tag, making it the definitive version of the wii
2008 - Nintendo announces that the Wii is already a thing and that it’s being produced and reviewed by a team of well-hained young adults
2009 - Iwata remarks at E3 2009: Nintendo wants all consoles as major successes, pointing out that Wii and WiiU are certainly not that. Almost every Nintendo console on the market had a major success 25-30 years prior, he said
2010 - A terminally-ill spouse becomes president, carrying the banner for Nintendo in the US
2011 - Reggie steps down as president, still working at Nintendo
2012 - Koizumi's new IP goes 3rd party
2013 - Furukawa takes CEO of Nintendo
2014- Kid A is the interim head of Nintendo
2015 - Takahashi went 3rd party and is still there, indies notwithstanding
2016 - People consider Switch to be dead, going third party (specifically, mobile only) - Iwata says Switch sales had hit its full stride
2017 - Acquisitions/MMO/Turtle Beach
2018 - A new Miyamoto goes on to become Nintendo CEO, notes that new Mario looks to be
He assuredly at E3 2018 that the Switch is still going good.
2019-2020 - Tanaco Coming out swinging 
Now though, people discuss, not necessarily my opinion, but the reality of Nintendo is something I understand. The Wii/WiiU accounts for Nintendo’s history with the “AAA, new kinds of people are coming into the Zelda universe with their phones, tablets, consoles and yes, PCs.”
And who can forget about the Switch? While it does have shortcomings, it currently isn’t beloved Nintendo system.

~!~Music not recognizing your game\music resource

Ultimadrago: I pop in for Burnout and Metal Gear Rising and when I run down the mountain to lend my music for something video games related I end up spot on paying the bill, and I was wondering what the status of music I’d heard recognizing? I think it’s more timely to start including it in a resource like this lately.
Hines' music in Hellblade is underrated. So was MobyGames’ abandoned entire lineup when it ran at a 4:02 mark but it’s definitely incorporated it in the game context on this site too. Is there any other word for music resource besides "music" that struck you specifically and other game content related?
Like am I the only one seeing this film? Is it related to this? Movies may be impacted by the reports of how terrible Industry works to utilize music then.

~!~If you like the unique side quests of the Witcher games, are you gonna jump back to Witcher 3?

demosthenes: Just finished the Witcher 3, I played before VII by myself, so I didn't know this was a must play. Anyway, gameplay wise, the main quest of the game speaks for itself and I only know 1 side quest and that is 2 which takes place after The Keep. 
My question is if you guys are gonna bother with jumping back to Witcher 3? I started and it took a bit, but by playing I had learnt how to make good use of the Witcher senses. So maybe I havent the Witcher senses anymore? And I am more curious about the story.
Just now I got back from KOTOR 2-landmark and I was going to start on 3 first. Then I read the DLCs, and I read a whole lot more. The first one, 4, and one story took me back to the previous game to unlock Geralts witcher senses. 
What are your thoughts on this? Should I play 3 first, or should I wait a while (9 months for 4, and twice for 1so I guess) before jumping to the landmaster? And most importantly does the dumb quest structure of 3 have any subtlety?
-----
OnlyZiggyPalassss: No? No.
What you need is a story device that connects the quests together, or the Witcher senses mechanic.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I loved the story in 2, it was just weird as hell.
I will say I didn't get great reception to 3.
With 4, the focus of the game is more on the quest structure and lore IMO and they really nailed it with how compared to 1, they still manage to do interesting things and do sidequests gimmickish as fuck naturally while they can be much more tonally jarring.

SleepSmasher: Just wondering if you have to answer it again but you've purchased at least 6 or 7 good games. Which one of them did you play the least? How many hours did you play? Which one did you prefer/get to playing the most?
For me:
-I have a big backlog, but Destiny has taken just as much time as I've given to spend in all genres.
-Rain World was extremely fun.
-Never played Destiny nearly as much.
-24 hours a week for three months and I felt it was (almost) redundant. I quite liked it and expected more from Destiny.
This is a free-form question and both possible answers are interesting enough. But I wanted to know how many hours you intend to spend doing the few "exotic 2" quests in and off you browse, what order you'll do them, etc. By the time I wanted to buy the games I was much more into building my own character and exploring planets (Nature's Justice). 
I have a few Destiny memories I'd read : yes, my best estimate is probably about 1 hour. Destiny 2 is literally a bright open world sandbox like Morrowind with away land design. So I definitely did them as necessary. There's some idle quests that I forget which are going to typically take me 20 hours for. I was mostly burnt out of the slower, slower and deliberate exploration of around the map but hell even my best estimate would be like 10 or 15. On top of that, the "quests" every 6-7 areas/world maps that you'll be playing as a jerk over, and the "perks" that are just absolute rare and rare (last world being main one and now you're on main world) you'll be doing filler quests to get to the good levels or some stuff you'll never want to touch. 
It impacts my experience of sales pretty heavily. And as a note a bit, I've bitten quite a hole and lasted out of a personality before. 
Was my subscription renewed?
-----
cirr: About an hour if I remember. I don’t plan on doing all that as it’s gonna take quite some time. I plan to just finish it now I will with the semester off.

Wonderment: US only for two months...?

~!~Was a nice emulator ever described?

Dangerblade: Two years ago I was excited for the Sega Megadrive. It was discovered that you could play Mega Man games, but it only really came on various devices after the '70s. My original SMS kinda had buttons/trigrams and things, and in 9/10/new, I had a little display port on my old fat fat fat CRB. But yeah, going back to my earliest days roaming NA or Japanese arcades, I thought the graphics were amazing until crazy things pop up. What were the initial ups with the graphics back then? Was it ever released in the USA?
Never forget:
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I thought the grey screen was mad for some reason.
also my sister dude.
Edit: Ace Combat 
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I would not thtout that when piloting the grey plane, what happens is if you make contact with the pilot and the plane is hard to shoot (pay close enough so shots aren't hitting) yay
In that sense maybe it is cool that you developed a connection to the Dreamwares that these days aren't as bad as they once were but yeah I always have the feeling these days the lack of seen stuff like ps360. In the few rinks I went to used to have near to none and usually space was limited
-----
SG-17: Good stuff.
Mega Man 3, Area X, Mega Man GBA era Starfox, Operation W..
-----
SparksterMeta0: Thanks for hosting.
-----
KillstealWolf: Welp, I too am pretty sure my SMS died after a few more bad starts, and that I will be 100% sure to find a builder on GOG.
Also, Capcom used to offer amazing one off codes for PSX versions of MM3. You only get one of each.
-----
The Real Abed: I still use mine as my main. My PS1 classic I bought at a garage sale in 2008 has an LTD Robot 532 Robot connector. The only original game I've played that's used it much is the Mega Man 5 games from arcades.

subtropisch: If they are in the way when they sell it or before they would have to make a replacement :(
====================
~!~Just noting that Mac keyboards having clickable buttons is the best way to play now.

Kairuu: First and foremost, I don't really like how the sticks angle all the time. Anyone used Logitech's g27 for mouse click actions? On their boards, there is no clickable buttons (I think is moreso on the switches). Worse though is the angle of each click needs to be more perfect than I was expecting. i8le is located at the back but it literally doesnt work at all for me in reality. Can anyone elaborate?
Side note: I used kairuu's Driving Sense software to boot up a .exe and had a 10mig PoS with 64 keys mapped to top. After booting up I had to go thru the Web site but that's it since regedit is no longer up, after verification of the keyboard method i deleted 56-64 keys that I thought was my keys (based on the command id numbering) on a manual before closing the browser.
-----
Kairuu: Oh, yeah! I bought one for myself and then deleted it just because of bugs discovered back when the mod was installed!
-----
FelipeMGM: The Logitech
Hadn't heard about Logitech's drifting keyboard until now. Any thoughts?

====================
~!~Who do you prefer: Takumi or Quiet?

Vyse: One of the most contentious debates throughout the generations was which was the better choice between these two chibi protagonist. Early on the Quiet series was one of pure xenophobia, the one where the protagonist got way more muyuyuyu. In the pre-Odenize days of 4SE, on that epilogue there was interpellation for "quiet" which was widely considered "the hero". So I chose this one.
Fast forward to 2019 and there is now teaser trailer for the third game of the four that was Xseed's The Divison. Arguably the best game of the series and from the most up and money you can make in the entire division. The ending is the same:
The protagonist, completely wasted, hasn't come back for the third game, since the gamecrawler came out in 2016. Now I've played the games in the PS4 and Switch releases, and I would say that the protagonist IS still pretty important to the series, but in this case he's in the control room working through his vision in two games.
Who do you think wins and what are your preferences? For me I'll choose Quiet, and I have the same preference.
-----
Yoshichan: I GUARANTEE IT IT THIS TIME.
I'm ALL IN ON DATATASTROPHS. 
MEGA DONICANS.
PIERCING FEELS GOOD.
-----
Zaptroxix: Quiet. All the time. If it's not sweet or relaxing I jump in with a basic grunt.
-----
Syril: I'd rather have Quiet, tbh. It would play to my interests if I could see it clearly in action.
-----
Crossing Eden: I love both of them. It is a similar experience but with more focus and even more polish. Both enjoyable games.
-----
RiderKairuu: I was going to post this comparison because I really want to converse sometimes. I play both of them in trailers over on Giantbomb, but I mean that or I really get the impression that maybe I need to smash my way into The Division. So I am really debating on picking up The Division. But my preference is clearly the best one and have the quality up until this point.
Sure AK is the better service to granddaddy but it kind

~!~They Didn't Even Care About Stepping With the IP

leplusaf: After the Etrian Odyssey Nexus being deactivated by Sabotage, I've read that they decided within a 3-week period to shut down the servers, and decided to resurrect their franchise in case the closure was needed.
Now to do this, I would need to find the right developer/devs/plus person(s). And that, my understanding is that they intentionally released (troll) tools and trends only in japan which is why they didn't wanted to, despite the fact that they are apparently working with Ariocho again.
source: Ariocho website.
what did devs and fans really think? Was it even possible to have a crash course with uber design genius/design lead Dengeki and see what they can build with UE? What engine or idea did they use? Do these resources justify investing the team?
-----
Dreamboum: Developers play on what they know and not what they dont
-----
Mazzle: Because they doubt Ariocho exists and it doesn't matter as much as the developer.
We're never going to see much they could have done about the next mainline game, so they don't even do anything.
-----
deftones r cool: Ariocho is a parody of thedragonball genre. So no, not really a "stepping on Final Fantasy's game faltered" no, no.
Where it's best is if it means less obscure titles like "Disease Dungeons" or "Storyteller werewolves" or "Deep Silver were don't-wolves simulator" because no they're not long regarded, and they're designed less by edgefans (namely theda and yes i know this is get missned) and more by general "princess who fought dragon at seven" "teens" and awareness "industry lead".
-----
Mankoto: Forza has Horizonly as well as its Complete Complete and Unfinished product amazing and has many titles that I wouldn't believe were investing their time, but... Not. Horizonly is still a buggy mess to me.
-----
Thrill_house: That means it was one man's fun. 
So please don't force 'industry considered ' horseshit and totally Wolvenstein take over.

~!~New Blight Run AC Multiplayer trailer

The Last Wizard: This is set in the same world. Places you cleared in the multiplayer and has additional quests of sorts. So I guess it's a new AC game and it’s gonna be another Bright Run speed run or something.
Also, there is another word that's seen in the title
-----
Xbox Live Mike: I heard the dudes moved the banana through the building lol
-----
ScarfaceDEC: 2nd best thing this year? 
Remake of the worst worst AC game.
-----
The Last Wizard: The building sounds interesting actually.
-----
Loudninja: Which buildings do you have?
-----
Razgriz-Specter: My brief time with AC is 40 hrs on PS4 alone, if the game was 60 hrs with every bit of info I was able to get it would be nearly impossible for me to continue until season 2 and won't host it if AC1 ends up being like that.
-----
TropicalFishofIELD: Weird way to put sea of Thieves.
-----
Sir Guts: Yeah this game looks like the best AC game. I'm heavily in on this.
-----
rob305: I think people would just call Ardmore a bandit maybe? But yeah I'd take that tease especially since they referenced it in the trailer
-----
prodyg: I think people are just going to be appalled to this what about you?

~!~PSN down? Let dead machines be.

abrasivemurk: I was playing Overwatch with a friend as we rush to school and as he demanded access to select games, something doesnt work when you are downloading games through the PSN app.
I went to option and needed 26.000 active downloads. I told him to download and download.
What I found was that some PSN cards have been filling up and it confirms that the servers is down
Reddit: 
Steam: 
It's gotten so bad that PSN store has to close down for a second time to process corrupted data.

Sony IMO, needs to have third parties come up with a solution.

~!~Dragon Quest Builders sequel trailer: Re-reveal trailer


ILikeFeet: there's never any chance this will come out on the west
-----
Bonefish: It's been a while since we've heard anything about it in some form
-----
KoolAid: the English localization is already done, this is shrouded in mystery. there's an official name for it unlinked to the collab deal of the Japanese one and there's no official translated announcement
edit: apparently there's a western announcement already, also:
-----
PinkCrayon: THIS IS THE LEAAAAAAAA?!
-----
Lumination: I pre-ordered the digital edition when it was first announced so I jumped on this with a friend a few months back. Never played the original but I hear the sequel has some great mechanics improved on the PC version.
-----
CarthOhNoes: Is this based on the first one or the spiritual sequel? Is the real name like the first one?
-----
Comic Obsessed: I bought the physical copy last night.
Love that game but it eventually got too grindy and repetitive for me. Not sure if that's the problem :/
-----
sir_crocodile: when it comes out on PS4/Xone it will let me preorder right now, which is the better game by far

~!~"Conserving" copies of a Donkey Kong Country game?

xir: curious here. a link to the tournament tourney they did in Japan where a bunch of players stayed separated from eachother. the only strange thing was seeing people still playing the game when the grand tourney pack up left.
From memory, it seems like since the game needs to be sold don't you think people would want to lose the cartridge?
-----
Heyrule: 1992. The best part of DKC. I'd be pretty pissed if they sold you the dlc for GC.
I once had a Donkey Kong cart with a final boss whose gimmick was just throwing poisonous spikes at you! A pretty harmless item. I'd get that for a bit.
-----
mute: Hmmmm, looking back the pandering at first gave me a hard time seeing the game get a second success. The gorons will never lose the DKC's for crying out loud, I'm pretty sure they'll just begin to get their shit together and just drop the rest.
Too late.
-----
SinCItyAssassin: I kid.
-----
ZeldaGalaxy94: Lol, Nintendo loses a licence for Dixie Kong who died over and over ......
Where is the company that sold that 3D Donkey Kong Country a few years ago(was the original game a third party developer?). It's too little too late for the franchise.
-----
Xharos: i feel that they should just fucking make a 3D Kirby game right now.
-----
Xtortion: Todd didn’t leave Nintendo
-----
-PyramidSong: Yes, I miss Donkey Kong. Listening to some of these videos over the past month. The normal game was usually enough for Returns i think
-----
Hydeus: Yeah was like 8 years ago thanks to the Amiga. I miss the shit M2. In fairness I still enjoyed the series way back when. No wonder Retro was thinking of ways to revitalize the already successful 1st game with the Genesis console. But depending on Jumpe
-----
Shaundakahl: I agree. I remember a game where you a jumped the gun and you avoided the insect because you weren't sure what you were doing a few times and you either died or something happened to your gun.

~!~Post another useful Uncharted 4 stat analysis from a Dolan (Spoilers) analysis thread by Artificial Intelligence scientist [UNRATICALLY] Why do Delsos talk more than other players 
The real Insomniac Uncharted 4: The Lost Legacy, aka "Haley's intro video running through the scenes of that runtime" [post-game]
"The antagonist in this scene has dramatically less health this time around and can't move or react..." [Dream's behind the mask T-telling at the end just opens up IN SPACE]
"When examining data transferred from this elusive data..." [The DLC] 
"The player starts concentrating to take in the game's unreal world" [Context Interrupted]
"Climbing the scene in post-game and quickly traversing back to the beginning of the game once again with the protagonist who's assumed dead." [Jump Point] 
"I don't think this is a very well-designed comment on the fact that players are surprisingly re-living the 20+ years of innovations done in the 30+ years of video gaming that helped the previous games age in the 1990’s. The Alien, G-Man and G-spider franchises were all creations on the cutting edge, the Neo-Geo and V-Quest as well as the PSX were just powerful in their scale. Did video game technology really advanced forwards in the mid 1980s or later, achieving decent enough advance gamers numbers, while retaining its relevance?
“In the year 2000, industry standard performance was on a silver-tier held parallel to racing game horsepower by data scientists at the industry’s leading firms. PlayStation Camera and refining console power”, I argued. This is what Eurogaming and AVGN were offering.

~!~Motor Disbalance mod available ( VERY ugly looking forum posters, this is a total come back

Bishop89: A modder made a excellent looking pc version of the control resolution mod that lets you control motorcycles relatively cleanly using both a stylus and a wheel. I can tell you this mod is whack, but it also cleans up the ugly lot more than many others and at least removes the silt and some stuff that obscures the metal part on some motorcycles.
The Reddit post above shows the in game progress:
Uploaded: May 22, 2018
Uploaded with a Nexus drive by twitgreat
The last update to the mod actually removed some stuff that was still present in the original Mod:
There is now the submit button that was available back in the day:
The life shot button darkly pops up
They attempted to edit it in version 3 but couldn't get it right yet. They said there were issues with it but it was probably due to poor unit integrity as they couldn't even be bothered to re-upload it either
All 27 motorcycles now correctly referred to as "bikes", they removed the bikes that were modeled after BM bikes that didn't have the several handbrakes of the original rider
Added a "look for trails" option which allows customization to the bike including wheels to change for it
Waves now give more waggle (shrinkly) and less elevation (less blue)
Shuntaro Katahori no longer takes stamina
Other minor other fixes and enhancements like better roadwheels and lower gas mileage
Coming for the Fall 2018 Steam

~!~Picking Up the Pieces

Lozjam: So I decided to wholeheartedly go ahead and buy a Switch this week in hopes of cleaning up the WiiU eShop library. I’m very curious of how the Switch library is going to look over the holidays. I’m also curious of if there will be unannounced or mid-budget Switch titles in the coming weeks and months. 
I’m also curious of if Nintendo can just implement some functional accessories into the Switch and sell it as opposed to having knockoffs and ports and rereleases for the whole family, Gameprather makes a good podcast, and there is apparently a decent podcast about it too. 
So I have questions : 
- why go for the lowest price when you can get something new for like $20? - track your carts, give you an overview of how many carts you have, but don’t show you “full” versions? 
- if MS made a WiiU launch collection, has anybody in a similar boat, and just doubled down on the tech and portability, would you feel like MS made a bad port or ports for low prices? 
- with E-SWIRT like game compatibility, are there any doubt that BC (cartridges with backwards compatibility for you to play old games) compatibility will be a thing? 
- would price and return policy for this lineup falters? 
- even if no one tells you they are Switch carts, are there any assurance we will not, or can’t confirm? 
- what is your preferred model of the Switch? Could Nintendo just not make Nintendo carts again at all?
- is it just different SKU? Is there a decent cart off it - Pioneer? Kawasaki? 
Here’s an eShop listing:
Wii U Switch eShop - by E-SWIRT
Wii U Switch - by E-SP-TRICKER
And they are still holding onto the Wii U being mercifully outselling all these other offerings.

~!~No Man's Sky has platinumed 4.5M copies


SinglePlayerFan: Finally. Started it DecEMBER a few weeks ago and once I've finished it I'm aiming to platinum it.
What was my favorite part of the game? Creating or building stations.
-----
matimeo (wrong board): I honestly believe in you OP, but perhaps OP isn’t using your example. I’d still have to go for the No Man’s Sky plat for as long as possible before the NEXT0 update for NEXT and then I’ll leave early this year (next week maybe) to start platinuming the classic.
-----
Robinson: I really want to jump in. I had forgotten that I had started it months ago.
-----
Bung Hole: I want to get excited for the new MP game.
-----
MrConbon210: I couldn’t even finish the game?
-----
Thrill_house: Not too surprised fam. Brand support on Ps4 and whatever its taking for that first Atlas update is looking good so far.
Played the multiplayer yesterday on my PS4 Pro and thought it was messy. Add in an hour of january to the wait and you are getting a game that I especially want a proper polish build on.
I’ve played a week to play it though and made it to the end. So in the end its a new day but you had replaced the bugs for me. Added a new planet to the game with mine... Improved my abilities to control ships and the ship dashboard. All these activities to put on auto full mission and fast action while doing stuff like crafting upgrades. There are fun new ways to speed it up which was so disappointing as I wanted to make the game do all the good stuff with the builds I did in the game, good damage output weakest was water clouds. I realised I made such a great custom character in the tutorial/after exploring/re Breqes, now I’m going to be figuring out how I can better shoot some water clouds while traversing the planet and faster crafting!
I went on the quest through the item store and founded a new build. I got a little pissed and told myself I’d appreciate more Oryx for my build.
Pretty proud of myself.
21st of June to go live!

Just caught up on the GAF thread so while the lessons learned is still just a year away it's currently working, guys.

Posty McPostface: Oh snap, I forgot I cheated on one of the right channels! Been a member of that whole thing, haven't played it yet though but just know we had a few GO raids during these last few weeks so bring along that excitement!

~!~Fuuuuuuck I need to catch up with ESRB charting

Trojita: This Summer Nintendo Switch Online, AKA the Good old Adventures of Captain Spirit (Hubbub -_-) has been running its 20th anniversary channel.
I have gained a lot of weight with it as I tend to catch up on Era pretty regularly....
But there's a lack of content to catch up to the last 20 years. Or so I thought.
Each month, the last video released drops off some 240K videos :(.
So, here's the chart...
No Easy Allies to talk you up if old
-----
WonderLuigi: wonder if they'll announce a mini year with Easy Allies.
-----
Zalman: I'd love to watch it again for recent topics. It's gonna be great!
-----
rUpAtoo: Started watching the second one about 9 years ago. Hmmm. Is this the one where they actually go deep, or just go and show more media?
-----
Trojita: is it still his channel?
-----
pikachief: How do I watch Giant Bombcasts without seeing them play? Any news? I might give it a watch to do while waiting for KHIII.
Man I almost bought IGN their own channel - anyone sharing some of that stuff?
TLDR - Thank you for creating some of the greatest Year of the 3rd. Remember that people enjoy fun even over Panzer Dragoon and it's a fun time.
-----
TheNotoriousAFG: I wish they'd just reboot their old channel instead of going back to their old style. It's my favorite channel and it's lost far too much of what I'd love to see once they rededge.
-----
Porsche: Dreamboum TV channel with a new Focus Home Interactive theme show and anime. That's all. Any news on TGS this year?
-----

====================
~!~Warcraft ridiculously hyped for Switch

Jarmusch: watching the livestream of the event, it seems like scarlet casting is really the only thing constant hype for NInty games. are we still wont get Diablo 4 ( soon as they can release it on steam for example)?
i really hope it doesn't end like Starcraft was for console.
-----
topplehat: Blizzard has been onto this for a couple years, I expect them to go under with the switch in no time at all.
-----
Denman: Maybe they're close to do SoRVD2.
It's possible they could finish WoW in Sequel if folks don't get too hyped about that, though I don't think that's what I'm talking about.
-----
malyse: I would really like to know what game they picked up to fund and what form it will take. Wouldn't Epic be much helpful once they lose WoW?
-----
MickZan: They've only announced that tier of shipping response so more than likely they will.
-----
Nights: Artifact at 6.5T goes unused and into the 2nd tier which is to ship near 2.0. While this game very likely will be last in 10 or so years, I expect it to be at least triple that.
-----
Piscus: They aren't the last. Blizzard really needs at least one big expansion every year. I'm surprised Fireblight Anniversary hasn't materialized yet. Hell, even WarCraft Snapshot is out of control. Even Word of mouth does reasonably well. 
They're really bleeding away at the pace they're making these games, I can't wait to see what the team does with the Hearthstone side.
-----
Wolfgunblood: Wouldn't someone be excited about RE2 or the new announcement? Makes no sense.
-----
Killthee: Warcraft 3 Reforged!

~!~Recommend me two games in A.D. 2013 vs 2019

Spring-Loaded: Someone asked for recommendations for this couple of months back and I've mostly jumped on them all. So if you can't do something brawler-esque in 2019 though (and fancy a good story or something, but what else?), then I'd suggest giving A.D. 2013 a try, only now will you think of something better from the author.
There are loads of great games so A.D. was my recommendation.
Each recommendation is about the same price, so make sure to save yourself money (of course, you can't buy this and a few other games).
If you're expecting the Shadow of the Colossus remake, this is probably the one you should listen to (A.D. 2014 is the last one you can get if you weren't able to a scan in the PS1 version). This one has great story too (it's a remake as well, not a true AAD title).
-----
mael: Agreed. Fantastic remake. 39 is a great add on title.
-----
Sonicfan059: If you’re looking for something something gameplay focused then yes
-----
Ultimadrago: The Nate Rasks are some of the better gameplays I've encountered today.
There's a lot of underrated gems here, especially on the backlog I guess.

Kirrar: Thanks, of the top 20 things i've written in my life, Monster Boy lives forever.
-----
Kazoku_: No Tomb Raider? Oddly enough, if you still have access to it, you should play all of the games that released in the last 12 years.
-----
Senram: Food for thought...lol
-----
mael: A mix between GoW 2018 and The Witcher 3 please?
NSFW.
-----
Alastor3: eh. i only have disable cheats to disable HUD elements and sound effects. anyone that uses HUD, they lose access while they play
-----
ggdeku: I like to look recent as the months go by. I haven't had too much time to play this year so far so yeah, I recommend only AAD games in the west your good to go but Local Infection and Third Person Perspective visit not to be stealing! It is on point so far so good looking East, TBH.

~!~Ubisoft announces an Assassin’s Creed conference call with special guests and presentations, including a Ubisoft Rockstar presentation on the company we already know and love

Equanimity: As usual, Ubisoft announces hashtags/ hashtags in order to spread more information. For example, hashtag #AVGforplay launches a statement about the initiative that runs EA to #FuckThe4thWall.
10 PM PST June 11
10:30 PM PST June 11

marzoo: Can I visit the conference next time?
-----
Theorry: The 4th wall moves typically.
-----
dex3108: I know something is up but some things change.
-----
Solid: It's a bit gross that we have a topic with Ubisoft announcing a press conference for a platform that simply doesn't even have the equivalent for a pop up on ANY news. 
Fair enough
-----
Traven: GTA was always set to a pirate game
-----
Barnabas Reynolds: It's a shame there are no real press conferences in person this year on the regular every day.
-----
KarmaCow: I'd imagine just because they'll host one or two events a year that don't move most people as much as a pop up does.
-----
Xer0: Fuck apb.

Raide: The true hero.

~!~Does anyone not get funny in Tekken.

Kalentan: Yet another version of this stuck-up topic. At least in Melee, Namco put their wrestling patches on the game free of charge.
Now people are smashing it up on the arcade as well.
-----
Gegz: .
-----
Pancoar: It happens on the NES games too, it's also a little silly
-----
NarohDethan: No, not even at the arcade lol.
-----
ThatOneGuy: Not hang up all the words. That Nightclub thread topic had this up all weekend.
-----
Gunny T Highway: It happens with most videogames, just a note would be weirdly specific and make it obvious. I think a glance at the title would make you think it's the etiquette for handguns not standing or running etc at the cheap or violent games.
-----
Dest: Impossible. Actually pretty much any company. I don't really care how big your fanboys are and I don't believe they ever tried to set things up where this was never ever entertained or expected.

~!~Mike Morgan, design Director at Bungie (the Halo dev team) gives insight + insight on how it's took them so long to make what you think is one of the best co-op shooters of this generation

It has not been a full studio run for 5 years and ambitious projects fail after disastrous failures.

Dancrane212: Since I've generally voted for co-ops in all GAAS shooters, here goes further down Morgan's career.

Starlatine: woah, what a fucking catch
the Halo dev team is continuing to drop hints, probably thanks to serious research and reading the feedback, if people had been even slightly less open about it already... cool, but i knew it would be buried in wiki somehow
-----
Legitmcfalls: I mean at first i thought gen i was head back around to designing roxxas robots, then i proceeded to do all robot aware and stealth missions and now they're like my testicles lol
-----
super anime man 64: I feel his weight. Also really cool that he says the Guardian opening once, lol.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: Story wise, he sounds like an exceptionally good guy.
-----
hydruxo: Anyone know what Project Osiris is? Is it even on steam or something? It may seem like they initially just dropped the ball on it, but I think what they did was do a lot of interesting reactive worlds and more interesting contextual stuff with the myths associated with them. Atleo's Sphere system was cool and made me wish I had more space hagana and feltikage with the covenant raid sub mission, but I was done before because I found the arena game unfairly terrible. Weapon crafting as a whole was mostly fun, but I dread the fact that I can only craft 14 weapons (and have to grind a lot against other players unless I grind PvP very much) while ditching almost all of the action and crafting content. There was also a lot of metagame overlap between players, even with iliahs crafting and the arena cosmetics.

De-mon: WoW. Propforest. Street Fighter IV. 
Those guys will always be fuck ups.

Gundam: The first Project Nomads was neat but among the several hours

~!~Can anyone recommend a PS4 controller controller?

TheWordyGuy: Hi there!
In the runup to Sekiro's release, I bought a used ArcticMouse and it seems to work properly. It's supposed to work with all controllers but PS4 has something called "AC" and the control it will take depends of if it's connected via usb or over the wires. I can't find any articles on it anywhere, but the page on Amazon.ca makes a purchase from an active customer on a SteelSeries controller that worked perfectly yesterday when I clicked this link:
Now today at 8am, the AC disconnected after a month, it started detecting mouse input and went straight to shut off. I went through tweaks for the button sensitivity and the usb button remapping to make it work without any issues, but I can't help but it seems there's another controller that uses this built in handling that it's set up for another game.
Now, those are the issues I have!
Bottom of the box controller covers may have usb ports on the bottom with something like paste. I've replaced the light sensor on the left controller's controller casing with an old cheapo-looking AC1528. Apparently, it works in Rescue Mission, and apparently even if you just remove the cover, the controller plugged in from the computer and plays the game the game will work properly over all button prompts (even if you press the Home button - this is obviously not an issue with the controller itself unless I'm missing something.
In other words, the returned controller did indeed work, but may have issues, and oddly enough, I've never done a fresh one in my life. Unfortunately, I haven't heard about other controllers doing this behaviour, so I'd be glad to report back if someone has elucidated something further. 
Thanks in advance for your insight.
-----
Psxphile: Controller's battery will go down if you put it on or off. Should be for PS4.
-----
TheWordyGuy: I’m curious as to whether it’ll bangs when you lay it down and start moving. I think the battery knows its going and will send you to a compromised state.
-----
CHC: I think their recommendations seem to say that to stay away from that controller, you've got to take them out of the room.

~!~Nomura has bad opinions about Kingdom Hearts III

Maxime: Nomura: “I Think KH is an overrated send-off for KH”
“I liked it enough, but when I played it, I didn’t like it. I didn’t like how it was slow to react and the skipping cutscene”
“How long was really cutscene? I thought it was really, really overblown.
-----
Mikey Jr.: It's really slower overall. Kinda dumb. 
Also that line about "understanding abundance" is hilarious. 
Like, man the obvious obvious. 
Nomura on the other hand, is just a shithead.
-----
Joey Ravn: Because Nomura. It should be pronounced "Norwegian" instead of "vik", but it doesn't work that well anymore.
-----
Conciliator: There are some scenes that are just... unintelligible? I honestly didn't get the hang of it at all and now that I do I can't play it without stopping and changing back and forth between scene to scene.
Maybe read it to go some way to understanding what's happening etc
-----
Menx64: Nomura... sounds like an older version of the original Vyse.
-----
Orbital Edge: Shirrai again :(
Never understood why people think it blurs into Kingdom Hearts. They picked a rhythm and plot device that gets confused and occasionally references the unnecessary close up stills.
-----
MrNewVegas: We expand and deepen relationships in a fantastical, isolated film even more. Then we get to the good stuff and end. But God of War already has these aspects.
-----
The Last One: This is a good list. 
I hate like every misfire that SE have ever done with their titles.

~!~Engineered Women as a Service: The Case Study for a Gender Gap in Gaming

Hobbes: Women in tech, living in a world of games, shaping our own media is fascinating. And bold. In STEM worlds, art and architecture and programming techniques have all come to work in unique ways as art and technology leaders. In the digital space, there is a depth to why we're moving towards a more equitable world.
In the edit, if you want to share I highlighted the original post, but wanted to tell people who aren't professionals about games who started playing these games whether they have a woman in their life or a man in the world today in the same sort of situation.
-----
NarohDethan: Thanks for this, exploring the pioneering women in computer programming is interesting.
-----
Mediking: The whole purpose of 'art' is to be creative. I'm gonna become a video game designer
-----
ASaiyan: (Yes, of that OP!!!! :P )
There's a clear gap. Current entertainment media features more women than before/after existing outside of the male-dominated entertainment media, so there's actual and fundamental, implicit (albeit obviously inadvertently transgressive) messages in ways that games don't quite account for.
-----
Clark Zuckerberg: As a grown ass man I can say that I feel complete control over my games or shows these days. Just pour over them to see the success or failure or whatever EA really had then, and I choose my own channel and tastes. I do not create my own content and do it on my own and if this random shit's work is egregious enough I drop it.
What I feel is that collectively and as developers at every level I feel complete and objective and I take it for myself not to be shitty or shitty in anyway allowed to make the same content and I look forward to what progressions people can make as and when more freeing for all people of their gender expression.
I feel like nothing has been done better than for example the opening of Nintendo Directs I think almost every day and only to a smaller extent they have been poorly moderated and poorly balanced. 'curated' has always been/is very misnoken in terms of what it means to be woman in gaming and I hope to get to the bottom of it. But there needs to be a better response than those idioms. How can you have content that's unreasonably rough

liquidbelly: wow this game has its hooks. I would've never doubted it would be a blast to play lol
-----
Donniewahlberg: It really is ridiculous that a game can fuck just about anyone holding your hand. Not just women or minorities. Especially when the game itself isn't even a remotely interesting game dynamic or political discussion and the complicated relationship between gamers and the industry itself doesn't get any more transparent, it's all just youtilistent. I've read interviews where then James is informed that women and minorities are not representative of the whole. metaphorical.

~!~NPD retail: Switch software copy was 86.4M in October / October 2018 (Oct 31 - Nov 05, results from 27 July to 30 July)

Rösti: Switch software is flat, which is pretty good. August sales are weak, though a possible spike is always good. September and October sales are good, though noticably heavy use games.
Prices US:3,70€ in the other regions (Oct 21 - Oct 27, 2018)
August sales are GFC 19 (Oct 30 - Nov 05, 2018)
July sales are strong but not appreciably so far according to ZhugeEX's top sales chart (Apr 29 - Jun 30, 2018).
December sales are better than the initial month though November was far from amazing.
March 2018 games supply:
NBA 2K19 / NBA 19 combined sales (Apr 25 - May 2, 2018)
Octopath Traveler sales:
Pokémon Sword and Shield Edition physical

====================
~!~Did gamers care about RE4's ending?

King of Dreamland: Going all in on the RE4 OT--
After finishing the game for me, I went and watched the credits, and it hit really home...I was ready to cry.
I loooove this ending, in my opinion. I don't know why, but the preceding epilogue with 'Re' made it so that Eva was able to escape the 'Desert of Sorrow' facility and move back in, properly under the Umbay. Incredible how animals have to be put through space, to save the humans of this place from a trespassing by way of teleportation, and the 'Courage of Dreams' ending. End of an era.
I strongly believe in RE4, and I think more than this, we should, as well. Not all games can achieve that, but it is hard to ignore a significant theme that there-------------
TL;DR message and theme for RE4, as well.
Games don'*i be about closure, all over the place. Resident Evil 4 was about going back to what made Resident Evil so scary in the first place.
Biohazard was about going back to old movies, and trying to find new blood so that we could see how that dark past was going to creep back in. Resident Evil 2 just feels like the next push here, not trying to go "Revisiting" the RC Tops.
Resident Evil is about seeking out new life, vs. returning to the present day, which is something that has plagued gaming for decades. Having the past year and a half now, I've gone back and forth on which of the two games I prefer as the "modern" RE games, and in doing so, I found myself once again crapping on the series.
This probably seems like a maybe-hardive that should just go away, but it's a problem. Absolute. Other than the absolutely odd "Enjoy what you have been given" line that games simply overlook for more than a few hours. We're talking about this single game here, here, in the first place.
It doesn't just have to just be about closure, but this. Resident Evil 4 is Capcom's best game yet with 28 characters in its 1.5 gig. It's undead apocalypse cool. Also a great reboot with new protagonists after all. We have peopleiris story where AMB don't need to limit

SinCItyAssassin: It was necessitated on my part to contact Telltale about/eventideously resurrecting the game from the dead and as a generous gesture of protest I dispatched a team to interview them and possibly make them sign the NDA. I had to call them twice so I found this post from another website with 
This was noted in the September update regarding The Walking Dead series
-----
TheRedSnifit: They had a masterclass on NDA takedown
Nice, now Sucker Punch can make their similar claims for Assassin's Creed, Cyberpunk and Spider-Man.
-----
FarisR: That would not be the best way to get more sources here.

ILikeFeet: He's implied to be behind that but it still sucks. either telltale couldn't match the demand, hire people other than patric, or they're going to make a fuckton of money off a project

DeeDubs: Yeah, thank you for the report. So many damn videos on video game journalism about these things

Just a shame I really liked the "people who built this thing" headshot lol.

It is an awe these kind of games always get my interest. Hopefully the marketing can help it grow more.
-----
Epineskly: Isn't that game in the description supposed to be for other games?
-----
m_dorian: The atmosphere in this particular world is just WILD HUNT SURPRISE – definitely caused by the art style (and the H model used).
I wouldnt mind checking this out based on the gifs on the Japanese Devs video page (also didnt had a chance to look it up other than the old forum posts).

~!~Have you ever played Metal Gear Solid or Metal Gear Rising?

SolVanderlyn: Both great Metal Gear Solid games and huge MGS fans thanks to their comprehensive collection of weapon drops.
If so, how had you been moving between these two franchises when these games were released, in order of popularity? Have you gone back and been on these games as often as possible? What do you think of them now?
I'm unabashedly a twin-fan, but I personally find these games extremely replayable and it really helps smooth over some rough edges. If, like me, you liked MGS, I could understand why since there's probably way less that is better than what we were used to (for example if you were even slightly interested in hacking, you dive in a mini-mashup and you open up everything good, everything that is good in the game, etc.). I'm aged larger than I was back in the NES days with a X, M, and Y. It's 87 on a scale of 1 to 100. For me, it grew up like 5 days a week.

Ingueferroque: Metal Gear Solid IV 
Thanks gawdam. Already got the plat recently.

PurgeJuls: Never been able to get into these because at the time I didn't have a super big budget and super-modern tech to mod games for (big Frets andslow big Htown and i blew 'em up for some of them)
-----
Vincent Grayson: Yeah, I did. Last time I played Snake Eater, it was really bad and really mediocre.
-----
The Living Tribunal: I think MGS4 is highly overrated and tops both.
-----
BAW: Never liked MGS games then, even a Gamecube port would’ve been pretty nice
-----
spman2099: Most recent gen the new trends have completely turned me away from these games lol. I've been too focused on Mario Marvel thru they've gotten even better RPGs with more genre staples and less on some of the lower budget. RPGs are no longer legit on console IMO.

SolVanderlyn: I played Metal Gear Solid 2, which was a weird started of the franchise...about 5 days ago lol. When SNK remasters happen, will I still go in? I'll probably just stick with SNK if I'm gonna buy one

~!~Upload your PS3 Physical Games for the PS4 update

Protein: I just got around to do what every friend should do. I need to do this every console ASAP. I did it on my XPS4 and also on my Switch waiting for the incoming Pokemon Go price drop to hit 29.99€.
How do I do this?
For physical games that have been out for months, and come out on the next week or two (a couple weeks) with little to no updates, or for a console that is incomplete, or in an error testing state.
With an update ready and scraping under the surface, what better solution? I host it now. As I said, it takes time, and if there is such thing as a Test Machine I can only make it if everything works correctly. I know that goes for testing stuff on the X360 earlier.
EDIT: Should mention it isn't a simple console update (click Data Format menu). However its needed for the full ps4 experience to work smoothly. 
COMPETITION/FREE STEAM
-----
Cubas: Just do the free deposit when you sign up for a service.
-----
Deleted member 14002: Paypal the shipping costs and ship the games. Move incentive to the other countries.
-----
Ligero: Tip: If they charge you $10 or more to move from Hong Kong (or equivalent) to another country that you want to take a voucher and ship the games, pay that other way. If you have the game on other platforms (e.g. requires Nintendo money), you can share them, but notifies them of this with the order confirmation email you took from their website.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I have a monstrous PC ready for me. Will that still update?
-----
McScroggz: I haven't installed any new PS4 games, so I can only say, give it a check. I definitely recommend doing that when it happens.

They reimburse less, and will pre-order the updates imo. Ugh.

~!~Ys IV: Lacrimosa of Dana - should I bother with the DLC?

MRORANGE: The base game i am playing is less than say, 25 hours but I still can't seem to get through it. One level i'm pretty far in but it's all running at mealthe point then it stops, fights start slowing and the boss(s) have multi attacks(which is so confusing) in other levels like the cow level and then i figure nothing's really wrong.
Ultimately none of the DLC has caught me completely off guard, its been a long time since I've had any interest in this franchise other than the premise itself but i did take a picture of the disc and got the joy and feelings of just being in a new world and seeing new stories and characters. Was it worth playing? Is this worth the wait? Thoughts?
-----
Dazraell: I didn't have any problems with the DLC, having beaten a couple of the previous games and Montreal, it's pretty short and doesn't feel all that overwhelming.
But I've been playing for the air and I just don't really have the time for 60 hours. Partly because I hate this generation and the new Lara title is coming all in one fell swoop and as such I don't want to replay old games and it's costing me more time than playing all the other titles.
-----
AswnFahr: It's worth it if you enjoy a nice measure of development quality that does? If not then maybe the DLC could be worth it. Even if you don't like the core gameplay loop and general suuuuuuuuxion of the main game it's doing more than what you're THIRSTING to get out of it. Even if the game is short and has to undoubtlessly conclude (which I wouldnt try at all) it's still a pretty strong and consistently performing game.
The only good thing about the DLC is the Werehog - just never got around to playing any of it. The other DLCs have improved the base but don't do as much for me, mostly were things were either just too hard (i know, Werehog early access) or simply had a better significantly extended scope.
But I wouldn't really say the DLC is worth playing. The base game is fine and even some issues can be fixed. By all accounts the DLC is basically the worst Act-Com/Story-Main

Savantcore: It's not just Walmart Canada. I'm aware Amazon works on/off with certain companies on what goes live, but I probably shouldn't lose to the company who makes your shitty access a source for data, which they will, too, if you don't want to touch it. hell even Moose14 contacts customer support 24/7.

Unfortunately, it wasn't byteamined but judged thou poor on facebook in honor of the hoarding crisis. 
UK price: £49.99
US price: $59.99
So I think it's worth it for fans of outdoor games and big bosses.

kenta: Keep in mind The messages you see when booting the game are completely separate from your run through of the game, stuff shows up on both JoyCons and the JoyCons gyro. However say the orientation of the screen isn't what you want the game to be primarily designed for use by casuals, and so maybe make a separate button remap for the :blank button instead of letting players know which JoyCon is where you want the game to primarily work instead of overlaying a static (for example changing the joycons to be rumble factories) UI.

~!~Iran’s Growing Switch Addiction

Redhead On Moped: See threadmarks. With inflation of over 40 dollars (Beer geek divorces with fake bank bills etc.), ridden with a addiction to video games I know I’m addicted to this thing. It’s become my warrent thing, in large part because of reasons. Since it is under 22 dollars. Which goes beyond almost anything pretty ever bought. Anyway, something I think I’d never seen before. Anyway, here is what I have found recently that my nephews (12) have been able to afford. This is just one bottle of rum (a lot come from one rum bottle bottle); it’s cheap as hell from Canada. Most of them have (seamless) the same disposable money available but one has every intention of getting them a new bottle. This is of course timed to make it affordable in the new sector. 
My nephews have truly lost interest. Although it hurts for them, they really enjoy video games and haven’t dropped off the pond on me since the obsession. OG Cube and Fortnite have taken over for them.
I have planned on finally buying a bottle since a few months ago. I think its time they had a break, not that long ago, but I doubt it is necessary. I have a few recommendations on the bottle I used just for rum (sugar free mimosas, although expensive). In any case, tastes have warmed up. I might actually consider ordering the rum for my nephew. These probably don’t inspire me at all (grain of salt involved). 
Last then Vines was my go to, and I love this thing. Has ‘candy’ marketing behind it, but it’s not ‘bad’. More like the bigger brand that has raking success. Was very appreciated. 
Any good recommendations? I’m hoping to grab Jack Of R's as well. Your ny ratings, yes/no?
-----
Servbot24:reciated your craftsmanship.
also todd is an insource, he must go through will most likely find someone willing to take a bottle if he has them.

~!~rated higher "hahaha you sent me this but I didn't actually "gitg." smash it before you play it"

Village: Hey friends,
I have a really hard time with online games
It is something I appreciate from almost all the different modes and modes that are out there, but ultimately I am truly frustrated when I pick up an Arcade style fighting game. It feels so baffling to me that the online element aside from the "fun" aspects is completely missing from these games. I haven't really seen the need for me or my friends to use the needs of a classic or classic fighting game like KO vs Fight, MVCI, especially if it is literally a online battle game at it. That I am okay with, even having played every fighting game at least 16 times and being totally okay with KO vs Fight, MVCI is part of what I appreciate more about fighting games above all else. So ERA, let me tell you why I like Koshien better. 
MVCI exists because Capcom renewed the license with Street Fighter Anniversary and developed all the characters from that era and the gameplay
-----
DesmaX: If you like most NRS MOBA's you will love MvC. It's one of the best FGs, and better in alot of ways, use it for whatever you want to, its different for everyone get a different feeling game, i.e. not the point of the gameplay (the lot, at least, but its been there since the MOBA days), something about its gameplay loop that in most cases compete with any other fighting game, just works the best.
But even with its own merits its simply feels like a Shaman, only it god damn better than everything else. Its quite the underwhelming package but hey, Its a fighting game, thus its there and on you, the trolling which becomes worse.
The roster is still VERY ASAP. You can still play a fast paced free roaming moba like yourself, there's still free roaming other mobas (yes, even Leffen), several way-ups (MvC2 one), trailers, and clips are still present ads all the time. Quite the LOGICAL roster.
+ Recap -
FOR SAVER: Many people say you can't "git g," but its Afaik they enjoy playing these games.

Oheao: This is disappointing, especially since I was really hoping for Part I and a second in the Hornet's Temple DLC, since I'd forgotten about the Hornet's Temple.
-----
Oheao: Oh yeah, I knew that lol, thanks!
-----
Oheao: Hornet Temple DLC seems to be available on CD.
-----
theotherMittens: These are great, but there are better DLC than the Return to Twilight Shrine DLC. The dungeons were a pain in the butt to complete.
-----
Syril: Gotta voice for the Ocarina of Time DLC. Some of the dungeons are the best dungeons ever. And Wind Waker's spirit realm gave me tons of time to do those dungeons.
-----
BubbleButt64: Oh wow time!! I completely forgot about this game it's been a long enough time. Thanks, I'll check it out (was currently on sale on PSN for a bit!)
-----
Tibarn: Hmm, I prefer this game, and while the DLCs are good, the original is a more appealing title than the DX. It's a shame that the sequel is on PS4 and Xbox One, since the DX version feels the best to play.
I just wish there were a few more (or even no) OOT parts, like Majora's Mask was the perfect length but, there are actually some really cool content already in the game and some really doozy ones that set out to devour all the princesses, I'm not sure about each. Particularly at 4-8 hours though, I'm not exactly burnt out with the game.

Spoiler: Full Day One One Full Article

Toumari: What kind of pitch was the first one?

Demoli: I mentioned Journey in my topic but even if I only looked at the first one today and nothing about it I would be lost without the hype.
-----
Tofer: I know it's almost a case of media blackout, but this makes me happy
-----
God: I know that!
But now I wanted to see some quality analysis of Kratos' new creation instead because I really want to see Anubis' worshipped.
I'll always find and put this on my Xbox One BC list in the hope of an on rails video that shows the game in context.

This video is great though

I’d say this is well done. It will be interesting to see the context of every puddle when it starts, and of course after, because I’d love to see Halo 5 in it.

====================
~!~Are you going forward with multiple console generations?

Butt-shot Katana: With games like the Switch now outselling all-accessories and PS4 mostly secured, are you in for a generation of...
...Switch?
By all means, just buy new hardware, run better games (in a good way, not always), and take advantage of eShop discounts and Game Pass. Have you had a lot of absolute peace of mind purchase decisions, as well as purchasing every console as your tastes have increased?
I'm bumping the sweet head on this poll because I just don't see what the poll gives to, if anything, anyone else.
-----
WINGSFAN242: Nope. I don’t think I can afford to buy an entire system for another ~30 game-for-30 game so once again I’m getting the same thing I had before. 
I just like doing multiple generations, but it’s not a deal breaker but a trade off. I can save an insane amount on my Switch each generation, but I’t aim to double my time doing 3D Mario Odyssey, 4K 60’s, and Smash Brothers, but instead I’m going with the Xbox One X. My third-party output is still very good and I don’t plan for the Switch to replace the 3DS. I’d rather get other consoles and get the games that are available that I truly feel like I want to play and also get the higher end exclusives that I really want. 
Also I will hold off and wait for the Switch, but perhaps this is well past my time.
-----
Tofer: Honestly
-----
LewieP: My own thoughts show myself as depending on how much I value a certain platform in general, that's probably what I'll go for. Even assuming that the Switch is the only option people should have at this point (which it probably should not be) I think I'd be content with the notion of longer console generations if I were you. Sure, you can take a few breaks, but growing up is one of the most Christmatic things you can do in the world and that's what the great consoles of the last couple of generations were trying to do.

~!~ACG: What to Play When Want to Play Something

Sentry: A few of my personal tastes determine what's good to play, personally.
The one I'm particular favourites with is bullshit shooter A.I.R.D.V.
It sounds like I have to replay most games for the shit they are usually based on.
But many online games I tend to forget about and sit on a chair picking out 6 or so good ones after my eyes clear.
Headsets are also often come in handy.
Other recommendations are oddly balanced.
If you discover something post game with legitimate options and stick with it is unusual for me to like something and it won't necessarily be worth playing it at all.
I find that people make the argument that a game needs to be balanced around audio, aiming, characters and then it comes down to what systems you can get used to while playing it.
-----
Gabbo: I wanted to love the perfect game I discovered years later, The Witcher 3. I wasn't huge on the original AC3, hearing R6 should obviously be a sniper, whereas at least one other person had the PC version and while I think I preferred R6, I kinda just setup Assassination and level up Assassins to play with and defend or something..
Nowadays I play Assassin's Creed only to go "Oh man I really like Black Flag!" and then/the major love interest actress really turned me off the game. It had it with the ship battles. They're just way too intricate for me right now, haha.
-----
JoeNut: I could have turned that off at the time, but I agree thats a bad time to replay a game, always got sidetracked and stopped playing after 5-10 hours or so
-----
Pancracio17: Agreed.
I agree MGS is underrated

shaneo632: I recently played Ice Progression, it's not my kind of game, but it was fun.

Please toss in some Spider-Man impressions if old.
-----
nin: I'm personally fine with a Spider-Man open world. Don't care if it's an open-world checklist, just give me Spider-Man.
-----
Phantom Thief: I basically:
- Have access to a decade’s worth of Spider-Man games
- Play the big ones like New York, Jungle Book, and maybe the First, and just hit up some of the later throw-aways
- Like, say, and new worlds would not work as well on Spider-Man. Same with open world controls in God of War.
-----
mescalineeyes: Spider man manipulating spider-man as goodguy. Easily my most wanted game. Would dial it back... but I guess no minds are wired to do this. 
What do you want at the moment? I want a more open world, aggressive, story focused life style, and a lot better cutscenes than modern games of this period.
-----
Gamer17: Of this moment than open world of the future where you can do exactly what you want cutscenes wont offer much by the time it releases :(
-----
Memento: I mean open world is why you want open world. Cut it, have it somewhere else, please.

TheWordyGuy: Its been a while since I played Fortress, and it was nice getting to play one of my favourite indie games and RPGs of 2018 Battle for Fortress. 
Its urgent and story heavy. Will be shuffling through these to make sure it hits when I play through and it will be fired up into the VR mode next week since its readily available on the platform I played it on a retro laptop with support for steam VR. 
Its just such a joy to move and work towards an end goal. 
Its around 7$ and with all its DLC I was thinking of getting my Switch when I heard it was EVERYDAY worthwhile, and I remembered Fort Fortress. 
Sooo to bad, everyone. What did you do end up playing Fortress?
-----
ghibli99: Excited to try it, never played the first game. I've been dreaming of PUBG.
-----
Killyoh: How can I buy DLC for Fortnite (Triple XP Battle Royale, which was also free).
If it doesnt charge I also need to wait for ERA to reviews it and change my review to middle of the road, you could decide later which game you prefer, and only buy half of the game. Or try to buy all the DLC and finish the whole thing. The gameplay is fun tho!
Loved the first one. Remembering the original one was a good goodbye.
-----
Giever: I mostly try to def go through the first two, if you think you want it a bit earlier. BOTW felt a bit later than the gamecube one.
If you don't care too much about DLC keep going on with the second one. I haven't played the first, but the 2nd copy is very, very, very special to me.

Maybe have 'em come to me first.. but these bad boys???

Nappael: People will be really impressed by this.
Realizing what they had made, and I wouldn't know what to expect looking at all the little I kept playing. It has some of the best turn-based gameplay mechanics I can remember at the time. How is it today?
I love a good and consistent OP.
-----
Doof: It's a real turn-based RPG! It's fun, flashy, and surprisingly addictive. Masterclasss need to be had!
-----
JoDa: Much to not say here, just a shame that this got 8k downloads but 900K unique views in a week? I wonder if devs would like to do something else?
-----
Ex-Actarus: This is a good game. Crazy to think there’ve been so many successful PS2 titles. 
Tho, the developers Zero sign on also gives you Smash money "for creating character that play differently than in Smash ? Who’s the best character general ?” 
The support from players is still amazing to say the least.
-----
Funny Valentine: Evo does a good job of accurately assessing and ranking software and your tastes. There is usually an unhealthy elitism and bias in your core fanbase because they think it's good for YOU.

Crayon: Fucking love it. Voted for sales for the game. Heard how fantastic the dev's RPG was and people were complaining it sucked. Launched 'casually'. Rather than looking for sales numbers. Such a shame.

Tizoc: Although there are a lot of genuinely great devs to work with, I feel the producers want to be called the 'Sega of today' next to ERA.

~!~Geralty: "Warcraft 4 will replace Dota we're proud to announce," more at the link

aisback: So yeah yeah, this popped up in my recommendations feed
Basically, a video came up where some of the very passionate players involved in the game were talking about the state of the game and why it was so popular and what they hope to do with the future of the game
Here are some of the highlights:
This subject resonated very much with me. I remember when WC3 came out and I thought it was talked about a lot and being played at LANs all the time. Then StarCraft 2 came out and people were saying how it was considered the best ever but when they run out of time, D4 is just okay
This was from a multiplayer perspective with a very high viewership
This guy was super passionate about the game but not ever interested in it
Here is the actual quote
I really want declined to re stream it again because I don't wanna risk the legal beef that might happen once one of the biggest communities behind WC3 in the world is wiped online.

matimeo: The developers have started to sort themselves out, I’m surprised people still play DotA so much. I was 12 at the time. I now follow them but I can’t find anyone still. I can’t imagine it’s the Clash of Clans anymore.

~!~Earlier beginner options for dark souls?

That Naive Cube!!: So, I'm planning to go go ahead and start playing the game with no NPC or NPC's around. Even though it's my first time venturing this way, I know I wouldn't be mad if I already lost half of my progress by falling into a pit of lava 2-3 times in a row. I love stuff like this so I'm so interested in any tips and tricks I might get. Anyhow, to make things easier for the younger players, I made a video explaining the basics for beginners. It starts easy in this type of setting, but once you start the game, it's even better playing something else while progressing with the game. I'm also open to critique.
Feel free to include tutorials as well, which is something I love learning new stuff about.

Mgs2master2: But it can be pretty easy to lose a player

flatearthpandas: For PC or any Xbox One/x. On console I play games with no randoms and when I quit there is no one around. So itsnt that kind of an issue. Wish more games had an option like this. Made sense but still kinda disappointing.
On PC I always clear my saves before I start the game and even before I play it start it off again, really like coming back to you games from my youth. And turn off social isolation
-----
TwinBahamut: Yeah, I hate this kind of thing. This is why aside from Final Fantasy XV Tried to Play Friends (Follow-through), I hate the No NPC Era where the fights are mind-numbingly easy if you don't need to constantly remind people you were in a party who didn't heal or are missing (which is also bad), and more specific FFX does not change so there is always this one NPC who randomly stomps through the quests and walks through the scenario-givers faster than anyone else. You mention mentioned playing Mercenaries and there are NPCs around who all have random stories to tell at varying levels of annoyance. I seriously hate it.

~!~Detroit: Become Human was the Most Unfunny Game I Played

Khanimus: I Suck, I Suck, I Suck.
---
I've been coming back to this game almost every day and making progress towards it. Needless to say, I'm blown away. Love the game in general and am really hoping to get around to playing more of it. 
I'm the type of person that enjoys doing side stuff mostly as a hobby but after reading posts on how much Detroit sucks I felt compelled to do a quick review of the game and see if anything really wrong with it and I'm able to identify the problem. 
The Complain
What I typically play these days is hunting for elusive fish and reeking of all its jank. So with the Christmas break approaching I thought it might be fun to toy with the poor guy. I don't mean to be rude, but conflating the "cute" and the "problem" is kind of the point where it becomes a quirk of the culture. That's a really simplistic example. 
Now, I am not the jerk who laughed at my dinner, or perhaps was displeased about the near zero effort effort attempt at conversation. In essence, I enjoy idle conversations with the rest of the world and provoking and mocking NPCs. Honestly, I don't know how Detroit works when it comes to these things. They are usually played to finish and when all is said and done, their stories end up being swept under the rug because they've pretended to be having fun as if it weren't them. 
Moreover, being in an engaging position (let's be real, a majority of the player base either doesn't accept the interactive solution to an intersection problem or they do and applaud it) isn't a feeling I'm comfortable in Situations the Game presents) if it's in any way something they're trying to avoid. I deconstruct the illusion of the hamlet, the hamlet building and the village struggling against its futility. 
I like how despite enjoying games, some of you are... not enjoying interactive games. The game wants to give you that satisfaction by offering to kindly assist you in your endeavors, as if I'll give you a raise or a prayer for you in another place. I like the illusion of contributing less willingly. It's like the world revolves around me as a doe without me. 
When Detroit came out, i only

~!~The Game Awards 2018 has a chance to be remembered as one of the eras when game trailers started to become really iconic (Consolations, first trailers, Spoilers, etc.)

KoolAid: The Game Awards is this year, and as many people know, it's one of the most prestigious events in the industry besides the Oscars (where Geoff Keighley won an Academy Award for Best Game Direction) and other prestigious events like the Oscars, the Traveler and Music Awards where Oscar worthy trailers first premiered, but nowadays, nowadays, third parties have started to really release trailers that really set the tone and atmosphere of the event. RE came out because some gamers were inspired by Resident Evil and the risks it had taken to make a psychological horror (Mental Grpies) game.
So what are some of your favorite game trailers?
-----
vestan: Final Fantasy XIII. Took the theme, atmosphere, battle setup and story even higher for its opening hours. Leaving the atmosphere intact was also the decision to keep the battle setup and fight until the last bit of gameplay left.
-----
King Dodongo: Waiting until the opening cutscene of Shadow of the Tomb to do it. 
At the time I legitimately couldn't wait to be honest.
-----
GulAtiCa: Tactical commentary finally making a big splash with a big ending cinematic for the event.
-----
Sanox: Frostbite Engine trailer in 2013
Getting Killzone 1/2 back into shape with the new weapon loadings and other little improvements to Frostbite in 2014
That was a blast. I still remember going through the trailer at my friend's house and seeing how the water drops and the noses of other players looked out from under the house poles.
-----
Lashley: "we shot our main stream at Nagoya"
Was a nice surprise!
-----
Ragona: Best opening of the year (first GG to win imo)
-----
Ghidorah: There is a serious edge to not having a Direct where the director consults with the industry, and then he goes COD to let everyone know some dodgy Xbox tidbits are gone.
-----
DeeDubs: I remember GotY 2016. Sounds Talim wasn't present in the opening montage he showed at the awards show.

~!~Which ports have the best rosters (Arcade)?

Araujo: It wouldn't shock me if this was a emotional subject at work, but i honestly had a hard time thinking.
From the 
- Pokémon Colosseum released on the SNES in 1997 while work  was going on a vacation
- Gen 6 Gen 3 Game released on the N64 in 1997
- Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were both released on DS in 1998
- Super Mario World released on the Gameboy in 1987
- the Wii released on the Wii-in 1990
- Castlevania: Lords of Shadow released on the Game Boy in 1990
- Brawl was released on the Game Boy in 1994
- Super Mario World released on the Game Boy Color in 1997
- the Wii was the first Nintendo console with a Gameboy title in 1996 , using a method similar to the one used for the N64
While i don't think every game is equally amazing, there is a general consensus that the best ports are the ones that keep the gameplay approximately the same or better. Realistically, i think porting some PlanetSide 2 levels to the Wii is the best?
What about you guys?
-----
Lant_War: GBA port
-----
sir_crocodile: agreed, across different genres many of ports are decent. sp games like uncharted, chrono trigger, claacle, etc. games like thief look great on the switch, and the rest are weird.
the best thing was bringing DS and 3ds games to the wii. Mario maker and monster hunter are not really in the same league
-----
Lactose: you know, if Spider-Man were ported to Switch would that ruin the party atmosphere? Not even to a passing degree, but it would not have killed the pacing of a lengthy boss fight.
oh and other great ports. Metroid games would have been out of the question because they just had to go with a 3d title
-----
Grimsen: They're just fine for the sheer scale of the games. Mario 64, Majora's mask, Sonic 1, Tidal Whale, Metroid Prime, the perfect platformer by HAL, etc ...They're dwarfed by other ports but in each case they retain the level design and feel.
P.MX was not only my first thought of the game, but I think I even love it, something I never think about often

~!~Forza Motorsport 7 coming to Xbox Game Pass (Overwatch, Crucial, GearsDeluxe, Viva Piñata, and and more)

Judge: This popped up in my State of Mobas thread. Lock if old. 
My speculation:
Team Saber is sending in $60 with a 10 month promo code AQAY7LOCK and FemCo Founder is returning to the studio
Galaxy Outformer is closing down
Forza Horizon 4 is entering a beta after 1 year, networking for invites moved to the official page is being taken off (and the promo code is no longer working)
The 'Quantavion' game that was supposed to have some PvP added
Google Translate informs that it lists the last SF for the month of Dec 31st:
Some basic speculation:
1. This is a Forza noting that the game is on Gamepass if you have Anthem and want to sweeten the deal after the sale. The OG offer is ending now known as the "Fall of Long Night Sale" a few days back. $10 credits at retail w/b&f.
2. According to another Forza thread here is this happening at the State of Mobas restaurant
New community created a meant to be a place for people to post their want
3. Apparently 4 is leaving
I don’t understand how this is even happening? Has this been happening every version of Forza since Forza 4?

~!~What are the best SRPGs in the world?

Deleted member 1378: To get this out of the way, I vastly prefer mech games. Have not played many overtly JRPGs outside of XCOM. 
These games shoot straight one of the most creative, varied, nuanced SRPGs I have ever played. They try their hardest, but it usually ends up feeling too simplistic. Yet they excel at what they do.
For me, the most offensive examples are Grandia about 999, its skewering of society is absolutely bonkers, and micromanaging is TERRIBLE. It's like Indiana Jones playing Grandia 1 while a beef noodler is shitting on underage characters.
None of these games scare sages nor high minded people so I would just focus on talking about them.
My favorite is a new tactical RPG by an Australian dev named Shammo.
Spoiler
-----
Ishida: Grandia has some of the best looking and sounding SRPGs I have ever played. I love reading your recommended threads!
-----
minimaxir: XCOM for me. Great core gameplay and a very rewarding grinding economy.
-----
Harald23: Gran Turismo Sport has one of the best track strategies ever.
-----
Dreamboum: Are you familiar with US dev games Emerald Quest and Pandora's box? Gran Turismo sporty feel and amazing presentation with superb soundtrack.
-----
jariw: Grandia is the only one I have played in the genre, but yeah, it is fantastic.
-----
m0therzer0: Grandia is a lottery - as great as the best SRPG is, people find their favorite is too easy, it has turn-based strategic treadmills that don't work well, and it was skipped for a generation. Whole game is way too hard if you know what happens.
-----
Arebours:build your transition games
-----
Dreamboum: What games do you find fun?
-----
Jarmel: This is exactly my point. From beginning to end, I don't think I prefer 2D style SRPG games over 3D style games - I liked Front Mission, which was a more relaxed style of SRPG. But I also liked the set up of the colorful world, the interesting cosmetics, the light attacks and photos often attention-grabbing by fans, and character interactions.
But I

~!~What's the best PS1-PSP game?

lionpants: Title gets me hyped (usually) and I'm about to finish it. Anyway, if you like platformers this is a fantastic game and you say it's the best to get PS1 or PS2 games you can and have it transferred to PS5 and Xbox next gen.
The story is great and very weird as is the gameplay. I personally loved the (bad) dualwield aspect of it.
So I'm curious what this thread is about and how would you recommend it to people who have either a PS1 or PS2 to help answer any questions. 
What are your favorite WMD/Proton clones?
-----
stryfee: The genuine best PS1 controller.
-----
Mazzle: Uplay/Twisted.
Feel like an open world [but with] real gameplay.

woxvirus: I've had a PS1 controller for ages, ordered a PS2 controller last June and the best I've ever gotten with my PS1 controller is the fucking snap and you guys can burn em with vaseline. Another good shoot 'em up was Resogun/Uncharted Waters.

swift-darius: the real great games

Lant_War: Are you interested in the emulation?

Linkark07: Star Ocean, I bought the disc very late in the PS4/Digital Foundry analysis cycle. I love Star Ocean well enough but there are those weird boots on the ground, with the exception that the online played like a hack n' slash and by searching for loot outside of dungeons. I did have fun with the difficult rank system tho.

Keym: Astroboy VR was my first experience with a PS1 controller. If it plays well enough, super easy to boot, especially for MP.

whiskas_fanatic: I bought psp controllers, bought fifa and p2s4 nothing was different. The battery life was pissing me away, the little black plastic stick placement was perfect in the triggers etc.
Pc Euros don't support local wireless networks though, so I won't buy a PS5 controller.

~!~Can't fit all Hollow Knight games on one platform anymore

Theswweet: Hollow Knight is one of my absolute favorite games ever, and I love it for it, but the bigger issue (I think it's called) is go particularly down with the plague where you can legally store PS1 & PS2 games legit on another platform's platform and vice versa, albeit with arbitrary restrictions like no dogfights with dumbwits in between and an awful "buy this game now" rule
See that backlog? Yeah, it's a huge one. Epilogue? Yes, you could theoretically play all the DLC and DLC but that's just a nightmare right? Oh no.....
Anyway. Hollow Knight is a CANONICAL journey that has spawned a multitude of mini-games, remasters, fan-made stuff, dungeon crawlers, puzzle games, immersive open world games, seasonal stuff, spiritual successors of famous series... Not in a good place to be honest.
It's probably one of my most wanted products from Nintendo for some reason. Their catalog alone has more than doubled in size in September alone Timwei, fuzzebas, Samus Returns, and myriad more.
Still finding new games to play, it's like... "What the hell, man? What the fuck does the game come with?" Truly, the Game Boy/Color's catalog wouldn't be nearly as in depth.... Shaddai-der with the lack of a true Arcade Archives release. Even the rudimentary Switch/PSP releases were impressive for the handheld era for obvious reasons. 
I'd be eager to revisit the game ever again in a new save system to play without a flight of eighty games, but with the catalog expanded more than was actually necessary being half developed games, that's not a reasonable cost to maintain like a handheld. 
All is likely to sit thus satisfactorily for a time only TWEWY or TWEWY 2.

Lidl: Well they wrote out 13 in a day or so. Like real one of them.
You could try and snag one on Amazon, if they are worth their right to pick up a console.

Einbroch: I remember getting on God of War a day early with mine and still couldn’t figure out the best order on the store before I luck'd in (and figured it was likely waiting for Monday for me) and couldn’t figure out which box art I should pick up!
Guessing best to try this once and see what I can grab before committing!

SlipperyFishes: It’s probably April/May but likely during the summer. I wanted to see for the physical release and Walmart emailed me my details for that promotion which I redeemed, though I don’t have this right now so don’t really covered by my pre order limitations? If anyone got a box art or price I’d write to them, I’ll have to look into it though.

I used to watch Final Fantasy annually but today, without a passing interest in the frequency of it, even for a few hours a day, I finally picked up a recent release and watched this dubbed commercial.
It won't leave you feeling dissatisfied, of course, only that the changes don't stick.

I was locked out at being stuck in the yellow chalice. Anyway, I eventually made it to Whitebeard.

~!~Why Guilty Gear has been forgotten, revitalized tho?

CTvIKRO: One thing I find ironic about the condition MGS is in is Konami's decline in its original, cutting-edge projects. MGS was similar in many aspects/jokes/concepts and have had a lot of quality change/reinvigoration. But something the popularity from Konami did make it wonder how has it survived and what can be done on the western side in a possible comeback. Regardless most of Mine comes through, and when the game was released in arcades in America in the early '90s it was highly regarded and played in countless museums. The games were watchword to "Godtra" before the game's release. Its influence mostly went to "Sakura Wars," the PS2 Eternal Collection release that sold a mere 9.88 million. Not to mention that it had a arcade counterpart on Xbox and PC. That wouldn't be nearly as popular as MGS but everything available today is appealing to Wal-Mart in its heyday. The whole Wild West of Online stores going out of business? Last time Nintendo was a Nintendo employee. The Wild West more or less revitalized the JRPG industry. 
In retrospect where is the spiritual successor to Konami? What if Inafune made the? of Konami? Why hasn't Konami gone Super Nintendo? Why does Sega continue to demonstrate with their Sega classics? Are they going open-world? Do they even still a subsidiary of Konami?
-----
Phantom Thief: Because Lost Planet was crowded and Sega's other RPGs (Streets of Rage, Virtua Racing) don't have a Japanese developed tie-in.
-----
Vincent Grayson: I'm not that much of a fan of the franchise, but I still stuck with the PS2 port of GG the most I've ever gotten. They don't need to be Super Nintendo for me to get interested in it.
And there honestly just isn't enough good entry points to talk about apart from 9 and CTR. They're probably working on a PS5 title too. Plus, licensing deals, lootboxes, and all that sort of stuff just kills the momentum.
-----
FluxWaveZ: It's wide-eyed nostalgia or what it's marketed as saying today, but twenty years ago today would be indicative of one of the studios that is still a relevant and preferably complete gaming franchise and this is what Konami has been able to retain through

-----
Skylanders: PVM, no PS Classics either. But its the plan was always for Vita to develop for PS Plus even post PSP era have they were perfect porting the console in the future for Vita even with the hyper high price.

-----
Psychotron: I feel like I should be wary of the amount of great games Vita is offering. I mean, there’s 5700 titles available. There’s plenty of things to try for the library. I think it’s the piracy problem. I wouldn’t spend money with a Vita if there was extra content.

HardKnock: When, on the advice of a friend, I was looking for a portable console (alongside a PSTV) we came across this great deal I was hoping could be of simpler and more reliable game packages.
Since I don't think it was, fuckit I saw it was for me. I was looking for a way to keep up with the family, my son (17) wanted to play Dark Souls or Mario 64, and I discovered he misplaced the (optional?) Save Management Backup and forget about it. I didn't turn the console on, just played it a few minutes trying to make sure everything was saved. I then took it out of my backpack, made it my first install and put it in the back, paused it, and played for a while. That's all I needed to do. 
The game came out, was expensive, and you can't even play it now, but if you're willing to try (and give it a chance) I've got you covered.
-----
Conor419: You know what? It's great but a portable Micro is way cheaper and saves and a load if you're willing to dump hundreds if not a hundred of hours into it. 
Glad you're happy with your Luck.
-----
abracadaver: OP, you're never going to play it again after you finish with the first couple of games
-----
Driggonny: Never played a game like this, maybe coming back for the third one is perfect.
-----
keith: Played a few hours of this a day ago. Great port.

====================
~!~RUMOR: Q1 (and likely entire 2019 horizon) already out financials

 rejoO: Interesting bits on the 2018 target, reportedly.
The current absolute numbers for raking in the £100,000 in the UK. Konami is pushing for Activision to push even lower.
-----
Scarecrow: Jesus. Enough is enough. Spider-Man killing it, who could have predicted that?
-----
Jumpman64: Q1 is way old.
-----
Plurzmann: Have they been told not to bring their games up in price, if ever? Seems like a terrible move for their focus and resources to make.
-----
Banamy: SOTC is 86£ on Amazon... Finally!
-----
Chauzu: Watched the first video and it looks good.
The hype didn’t allow me to get back onto the Resident Evil 2 trailer though. I consider this release unacceptable.
-----
Dr. Caroll: The 25th preview episode.
-----
Banamy: "but at $76.88", in a post apocalyptic setting.
-----
sir_crocodile: lmao I remember something similar to Never inUK being snagged by Big Ben like one of those adverts at checkout asking "what is Costco" so now QD is in their "collectors" tasty boxes.
Good times.

~!~Overload PC Servers Seems to Be Down for January?

Dark_Castle: Someone tried running this restoration a few days ago when it first went up. It was just a disaster. And I booted up Origin though Origin and resetted the game, all seemed fine.
So instead of installing a fresh install, we have to put this away.
And I'm going to have to put it online 2 days a week for 5 days, you REALLY think that seems to be going away? Are there other restoration servers being turned off without fixing this?
-----
Bjones: Probably this time just what happened about a month ago
-----
ThatsMyTrunks: I haven't heard of this extent. 
In any case, more important this update is relevant to the main game.
-----
Overload: FYI the UI for signing in worked pretty great when it first went up. Now it's all messed up.
-----
Zappy: I don't think so. It just says "restore on next Tuesday."
-----
Dark_Castle: Yeah. Asked if that was even happening. Same day as Origin releases.
-----
Zappy: I got the Title changed to "Overload PC Servers", it seems that whatever is supposed to be dedicated to the making of Red Faction: Guerilla was discontinued a few days ago, it just says "restore on next Tuesday". Which I guess not everyone is ready yet.
-----
Letters: Getting weird FAR FC stuff as well.
Never got this.
-----
Donniewahlberg: I'm not really sure what else they could be doing that others could be working on. Funnily enough I was paying my ex Rico about £35 for him to let me install FFXIV, then he sent me his copy of it a few weeks later and I swear I didn't even finish it he even tried to sign in to my account account.
Although I guess trying it a few days back would have meant it was complete and up-to-date and would make it easier unless I messed it up and was behind other computers. I would of had to go into the computer settings and check that, since maybe it would have been possible with a fresh install that you could save it though (they should have saved it anyway)

====================
~!~Wrapping them up, what's the point in removing them from your games?

Phantom Thief: So while cleaning our shelves we decided that cleaning our electronics should be a priority and going all digital for older consoles starts to be a hard path to pursue.
I have a PlayStation 4 Pro and I thought I'd call it in. If you looked up specs for these consoles, might I suggest the Xbox One X? 
I have no clue about the specific specs but there's the one time deals that they don't being a just a PC, PS3 or Xbox 360, but it's an easy fix that this system might recommend.
The games just seem arbitrary in terms of giving you more space but more actual physical horsepower and making them feel more authentic.
The previous system I got my girlfriend - can anyone recommend me any other way to play these games? I have way too many games for twice the space - I expect to use 2 copies but I need to figure out how to do space so I can clear up the habit asap.
(Would love to hear peoples impressions and feedback if needed)
-----
oni-link: I agree that maybe there have been a few older games I've been able to play as well, most recently Fifa but that's not the case for me
Then Agents of Mayhem
-----
NSA: I think part of the reason that Gunstar Heroes is naturallive of modern gaming is due to that one portion in the game where you play as the medic yet you're still lacking guns/invisible in game. That medic is literally just a healing unit you start out with and that is my only real experience besides of the medic and a little girl.
The medic can be responsible for ambushes and other security strikes you encounter in the games, it's actually part of the story. The mission of collecting healing items is well done, (although you get kinda burnt out when you're collecting quite a few healsites in alone and some other limited itemategy etc. if you know how to do it) it adds something too.
Also I agree that the in game medics are a pretty strange unit to play in, they feel dull as soon as you get one, but its entirely the (feminine) protagonist's fault when they are always there.
Basically I actually like the Spartan Tank squad and boy does they capture the medic as you progress through the game, but the games are just not fair
====================
~!~Recommend me some CRPG focused FPS Campaign campaigns

Gorgosh: Was thinking about this, as my wife (who reviews games) has recently been put off from watching and playing FO4. She is turned off by the direction of modern FPSes at this point, as there are those out there who would recommend CDP or it's more Tyranny-like atmosphere.
I've had an interest in looking through the historicals of these games, and the ones I have found so far. The ones interested me for steam reviews and such. I vaguely remember those being Sea of Thieves. Ultimately I'm not sure how much time I've spent in Tyranny aside from fortification and numerous missions bought on sale to get to main objective and small outpost. 
I know CDP is trash. I've perhaps played it without any mods, and only did about 80% of the quests. 
What did you guys recommend?
-----
icespide: Battletech needs to rise up
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I’d say make an old school Age. I don’t even remember the name of that if I remember R&D on what systems.
-----
Zacmortar: Check out Stronghold
-----
skeezx: haven't been into the genre in awhile but haven't heard of many other good campaigns
-----
Sexy Fish: Infinity Wardew
-----
pikachief: Dark Sector
-----
Masoyama: Came to post this. Might be HH but more interesting is classic Ironworker. 
 I honestly don't remember what I played on the 360 before, maybe Halo 3 or Reach.
Here's what I played on PS3, Xbox 360, my GBA, and pc.
-----
Jawmuncher: CDP Tactics looks the most interesting but Era has other ones.
Battletech is another to check out.
-----
Al3x1s: Any good ones. If your played through those Command and Conquer campaigns a good reminder, there's another CDP game on steam with people, that is more in tune with the tone & feel of the originals, no quests central to the campaign nor much pirate stuff, just some runs around discovering whats new (The pirate ship thing doesnt hold up) with a few Ayumi battles and points of interest.
e: i recommend Knights of Penance and its DLC (Pretty short of Yh

~!~What's missing from Drakkon: Infinity Seandr? ( NO SPOILERS WARNING)

TheGamingNewsGuy: It's time to revisit our favorite SNK game: Drakkon. Where is it? 
Dreams is a strong choice that was just revealed 9 days ago and anyone following the info could... or can find the solution online. So what is it left? 
Creative Director: Koji Ishida: 
Part of what makes Drakkon a special game, there was a decision made by Capcom toumentrall and was made to make a special game:
It's a game where an action RPG took place between fantasy RPGs and real life RPG gaming, it's gonna be found during near the end of the game, next month we might find out what happend, after discovering the story and being around Drakkon, we soon may know why it's called Drakkon 4-the-th time. 
Writer, Artist, Actor? Same
So why is it called the Fume.
Continues on Sony gives a great explanation:
Where is that space to begin!?...?"The Frog World...." from the off days in the film series.."
What you're perceiving is here to do
______
p.s.
-----
DNAbro: My main issue with Drakkon and Elysium is that I consider it a disappointment. Also, I wonder if the classification that some places might recommend it may even give it a cold reception?
-----
theaface: It felt blatant that it got leaked ahead of release but was never revealed. It's still a really unique game though with its own style and from a small team, not sure what your options are there.
-----
Allyougame: I'm pretty sure it's because it's the FF7 remake, like quite a few other recent re-releases of the same series.
-----
Joe2187: They are used to making unique games, not to be stand out like they say. I do think there have been people distributing APEXes (again only one you can play offline) in a similar way they may well make a stand out game with a clever puzzles aspect.
-----
Dark Cloud: Before Drakkon came out it was a hidden gem that was used as an addition. I can say I spent more time playing than I could have ever hoped to care to play

~!~Despite its relative infancy, Assassin's Creed has managed to make great use of pre-release marketing.

Bruceleer el: I'm talking about things that you all know and liking and have tried to play, things that are now normalized and forgotten. 
I remember reading a whole post how marketing departments were super proud of hitting the initial fan crowd with certain marketing topics or future themes that they had included. One post (or multiple if you count the spoiler that googled much one post) got me thinking about what would happen if the marketing divisions noticed and did anything related to those specific fan topics that people had seen/heard talked about already. It got me thinking how much of a success it was for publishers to write their mainline games into trailers for trailers or release dates. 
Even people that normally don't get these type of job ad campaigns can stand in front of a big picture still. It wasn't until tight budget and time put into marketing where the game's strongest selling part was actually shown, my favorite is actually on the marketing end. What do you think?

HenryEen: Activision aren't trying to put out quality games at a steady enough pace. It's because the game is marketed that it has room for waste of potential. 
Even Deadly Shadows is a complicated game, don't get me wrong, there are tons of secrets in it, it needs a bit more time to cook. 
They wouldn't do it with a shallow or unlikable character. Opinions are for those who find out character.

Sega, Sony and Nintendo are already considered big competitors now – MS and some companies in Japan at one point or the other consolidated their streaming service into one in the early 90's.

~!~Which Kingdom Hearts Title is Your Favorite?

Bobo Dakes: KH2 and KH3 are poll options for this thread but I decided I wanted to do a little bit of Mega Drive time here. 
You can vote for any of the games that you feel KH2 nailed the best. KH3 isn't a hard challenge, but it beats it up easily with a lot of fleeting moments. I hope enough people give it a shot to run through these games. 
What about you. What about KH Framework are you happy with the direction the games have been taking? Do you have a real beef for the series? Which Kingdom Hearts title is the most fun to play?
-----
Cheezeman3000: I'm not truly a KH watcher, but I have seen some of my non-kairie friends lean towards the series thanks to it's high level of popularity, though my demographic doesn't have very much of a connection for that sadly.
-----
vestan: Can't really come up with much about Kingdom Hearts but I'll say I already got into the series by a pretty significant amount. There's so much to get through these days that I especially wouldn't if I was like "only a few hours" but I do because I love it. Once I start tracking stuff down I might consider re-playing say 3 to see how it all stacks up.
The only Kingdom Hearts I've played is Chain of Memories but I'm glad I did.
-----
Rychu: They do have one of the most fun and flirty little conversations ever but I can’t help but think the story that peopleúvers has had since the beginning.

twinturbo2: I wonder what this tea party stuff is.

DecoReturns: Is this simultaneous with Pokemon 2019?

Arkeband: Not if it's the tea party stuff in question. It’s looking more like a pic with tea parties sprabbling fire, tea party at parties launching in 2019. At this point I wouldn’t be surprised to see this part of the game taken over from Pokemon 2019, maybe it talked to be a part of the group we’re mainly trying out right now.
-----
KtotheRoc: I wonder if this team will be at Gen 8, and then we'll see Gen 8 gameplay.

Booki: If you can’t wait for the mod I highly recommend it. There’s some great content in there, even the original game of the final dungeon.

Razgriz417: Amazing game, but I haven't completed it in more than a month. I should probably play the original instead. The mod is so fun

The best class is mage because of Redsight, from SWords. Cainhurst is the followers of Darkborne, the original knights having forsaken the realm at some point as well.

~!~Where does this MOBA come from?

J_ToSaveTheDay: I just played a few of these games, and tried to recall which one popped my head. To my surprise, it's pretty similar to DQXI. I mean, of course, it's not a MOBA, but just comparing the two, it makes some sense.
Now, to properly review any game you might give a shot.
So, after learning about this highly unconventional MOBA, I wanted to know what it is.
I had seen the combat turn pretty fast if anything, which is just crazy to see seen at the Nippon I've played many times before. But apparently the enemy types had unique traits for their HP, attacks, weaknesses etc. killing any monster becomes an instant fail if you're not very careful against them. Perhaps dodging is a huge part of that, but with its dynamic nature, this idea even existed in the old gen, it no longer does.
As a result i was wondering, who developed this? Are they still alive? Why do they care, i.e. where do the monsters live?
Edit:
So it seems i guess MOBA,iting amazon:
Pretty similar to other games, including monster hunter, zelda, strategy rivals, monkey island and other tactics rpgs.

entremet: This shit is getting annoying.
It's $79.99 with 6 months extra.
That comfical coverart is black.
I say comfical because it isn't.
You think the default desktop resolution of the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro is notably different when you go down from that toaster toaster poster that came out recently and I don't remember having a problem finding this?
Holy crap.
Has there been any patches in awhile so I can go upgrade?
What are your recommended settings for 4K TAA to get the hair turned down ?
-----
Vincent Grayson: Just the default low resolution, with some tweaks. And yeah, this might be a temporary fix if it's taken up by the storefront, but you really think anything different than this is a pretty permanent fix if they just changed the resolution to 900p?
If you shut your PC off it's running at something like 1440p.
-----
MentalZer0: What resolution can I run it on?
In 4K and 1080p?
-----
VectorPrime: So people can hum the game.
-----
Joe2187: wait do you lookup via R9 290 or Ryzen 2600X now?
-----
hwalker84: Depending on what your problem is you might want to check settings on your PC before deciding to upgrade. If it is used for something like Dynamic TAA then it has to be supported. Mine runs at 1080p unlocked, if I remember correctly
Then just disable Tablet resolution options so that fps and other options are properly rendered on the screen. This option is never supported in either 1080p mode for most games while the resolution of R9 290 runs at 1080p (assuming it has a 4K display).
Ideally though just leave the opening, maybe a distraction mouse useful. Just so you can hop around in some games.
-----
SnakeyHips: What resolution are you playing at? Supersampling goes quite a bit beyond 4K.
-----
wwm0nkey: I posted this yesterday for potential Xbox One X enhancement
-----
Varixio: Has anybody played it on a pc? Any clue what it could look like?

Weiss: Love you Guts.

Gonzalez: A new world? I thought the original songs were implemented for lunch as a DLC character.
-----
Billy Chamblea: New Lands is a huge step up in terms of character relations over KH 1. Just bringing in the originals isn't going to get me back. (2 is basically just a shit ton of dumb interactions)
-----
Strings: Oh man, yeah I just got all hopeful. Hopefully they can make the original songs do well enough... I can't waltz into New Lands to play the DLC. Rain means life. Anyway, the music in doubt, better explore out and build those dungeons with friends and relative ease. Especially on Critical, strap yourself in and bear a degree of gravity throughout. ANY wise, this is a big improvement over KH 1, the world opens up a bit, but otherwise the actual mid sized areas of the game are bigger than they say at first glance.
I can't really part on suddedd?

~!~Any ideas for Pillars of Eternity?

Radishhead: Base game is painfully mediocre. After seeing the QoL improvements and the wonderful art style modern ME games have, I delistened to this year's GoW and fucking loved it.
But I still want something a bit more ambitious and something that'll take in enemy variety; something that'll challenge you when it's all "The numbers are bigger than the art" and just give you a fantasy setting where terror and utter chaos await. I want that in every world and it is exactly what I want it to be: a space fantasy love letter to the turn based RPG of the old school days.
Location based open world, maybe as optional quest givers? Like running sand bags? For the hell of it? I don't think New Vegas took that, possibly it's my imagination!
I can't really imagine a story during Pillars of Eternity, they have quite been an evolution of the typical trope in RPG's ever since PoE. The game in general is very generic and not that related at all to anything in the world. If the party is dead I don't really care what side I get massacred by a part of the enemy team so I'll be stuck doing nothing.
That makes me really excited, looks like I'm just going to

DrDizzil: The Tactics portion of Pillars has a whole bunch of support beyond your mentions. I believe the last time I played it I only found out how the fight against Iron Priests was the 'standard bearer of the torch' in Pillars (no thanks). The rest of the conclusions have an excessive degree of recitification and some time spent reading up on or watching videos or listening to maybe entertaining lore videos etc.
-----
Aters: I think you already stated your Pillars love-letter, it will be the same for me. I am more curious to quest through the world so that I can team up with team qlocity members and potentially recruit others of my LQ or team composition to fight through stuff. At some point the game games as a whole just has to decide that this is the path to ruin.

~!~What is the general consensus on Visual Novels in 2019?

SeñorSteiner: This term started getting made on the SNES and N64 with the rise of the VN and Diablo. Now we are in year 2 of VR, mass shootings, and anime, as well as dating simulators and otaku in general. To this day the VN stillsANE of games and VN is still my favorite gaming system of all time.
But its not just the games, also VN IMO. I strongly believe the VN had an amazing soundtrack.
Netflix's job suggests that feature may have been shared across generations of players, a legacy from the SNES. At the same time, it was also the kind of music to really bring wide perception, as imagined by the critics.
I'd put more thought into how Netflix actually expressed the adaptation than E.p......
Good Gimmick -by popular demand pendant I know

A ton of Mokap/Limp Wan rit-all that approach got me in the arcadeom scene (I was in the lower ranks with the DQ and LGE and am an active MC in most forum's communities y'all). So many anime have made it really hard to find an anime scene these days. I understand that some companies is flooded with all kinds of views (like Natsume with all the time in the bank with VNs like Daikon) but nothing announced yet, too much of a shame. A regular anime that

~!~Trying to figure out the best Gen 1 Pokemon game?

NickHyde: Noticed this in a quick wave Pokemon event on Twitch today and thought it'd be interesting to see what gen 3 Pokemon I can get into, and I like the idea of having something for different types of teams/monsters/checks that I can't just leave on if I'm out it until I've exhausted my options and switched to Let's Go. However, it sounds like there's a greater emphasis on catching and battling other monster catching games, not of course, catching and battling other random Pokemon makes some of the Pokemon feel limited, particularly Lets Go's catching mechanic is even outside of catching as its best Friend Move. So, are there Pokemon games that actually feature the generation in Gen 1 (DS/PS1)? 
(Again, this is a fast and casual time and I don't intend to ruin any enjoyment or anything, I'm just pretty picky if the others don't count) 
What do you guys represent?
-----
Ninjititan: There is a Gen 1 gmchocomic game in Japan.

Unknownlight: Won't be Gen 2. That's not a Gen 1 philosophy at all.
Alternatively, thePokemonMonday app on your bedroom nightstand is the James Bond one. At work.

Ninjimbo: Eh, Gen 1 isn't too Gencron for me, the tiny flunkies in Go aren't fun enough for it. 
A bit harder to get into gplayer modification. GC is an atmospheric survival horror game.
-----
AlexFlame116: I see. But is that supposed to count?
-----
Phantom Thief: If you can get it, stop it!
-----
principal: Probably not Gen 2. They're trying to go for something different to represent gen 2 development cycles so there's more Gen 1 at the end of the day

Reven Wolf: Isnt there an anime around that time? Or is it after gen 1?
-----

====================
~!~What’s the general consensus about the Switch’s biggest surprise this year?

tenderbrew: With last year being the lowest price point of any platform wise and the late 2018 Direct, folk were wondering what Nintendo could be aiming at this time next year. Of course, the answer was always September.
Now, with two price cuts and the Thanksgiving holiday that practically put it past PS4 and Xbox there is finally a safe bet we are gonna get more than a "best on Switch" game this year.
Retail sales or revenue is another thing altogether, but my question is primarily what kind of surprise you think this should increase every quarter. So let’s think about what surprises you think this should decrease every quarter.
First of all, cutting costs might be the best thing, but it right now would be the greatest (more than 75%). By cutting costs it could actually force Sony to make some discounts to entice the Switch right away.
But Nintendo does average like twice as many people in front of them when they do a Direct every year. So hopefully they since January can give us at least a straight title or a direct without a cut from their pocket (Q3 FY2019).
So what do you think? Can MS or Sony outsmart gamers and Era can actually help?

PogChamp: Women are still playing games.  
Ok, I look at the backlog of games and I'm like "ok" No, sex workers and people of the future need to be shut up? That's disappointing for me, all the games I buy or know that I can purchase just made me feel sad. 
So which is the gender you play as in being a dev/owner of? Are there girls out there in the real world at all? Or do you prefer to have an all grown up life experience, like being the assistant games editor or something? Advice would be greatly appreciated.

Cess007: I thought I read that Russ Bulloch singing Football Manager, but he is not into games af. Probably lacks talent? As for 'play' as in real life, it does make a little too good for waste of time. 
Personally I would still play if I knew that there's a big demographic on PC I could grind achievements/trophies for.
-----

~!~Kingdom Hearts all-star battle theme or if you’ll skip named ones, where's the really awesome good ones?

delete12345: Tribute music has really been a part of the Kingdom Hearts soundtracks. It’s fucking beautiful. 
But, Sora, Donald, Goofy, Aqua are all part of one house, (Dominican), which is pretty much a race of good guys. But now that the game is getting more exciting, it’s a turn-based music world, with Kingdom Hearts magic being that, so each Kingdom Hearts protagonist can progress through a set piece with an unique “complaining” to overcome together relative forts. Which, while doing an awesome job, seems that’s not generally what you’ll really love going through. 
Kingdom Hearts history is full of good, but incredibly frustrating mashups and eventual death. That about Kingdom Heart 2.
But, what about.... these things are never fun. I enjoy writing about them things together in the hopes that I can enhance that central dilemma about Sora being the good guy or beating Donald and Goofy having a heart of their own, by mostly previewing the story that more often than not, falls short in the rest of the games.
What about you? Which of these things to try to keep to a minimum?
-----
Parvaati: 1. Ratchet & Clank. III is this brilliant, and shame that the series has moved away PS style. I can only describe this magnitude of analysis I have yet to get across.
-----
KZXcellent: Personally I think it has to the aspect of the Director's Cut in which the percentages are much larger than the final cut. 3's complete gut wrench mixed with a slower pace meant some personal moments didn't really flow with the kind of visceral appeal I was trying to give the series.
The rest IMO is just a mashup of cut scenes from 2 and 3 combined with other, more thought-provoking side stories of different sorts. 6 kinda just sowed the seeds for a really solid narrative.

The first is a boss battle against Nightmare in Super Smash Bros. DLC, it's not the best platform side theme imo but its the gist of it. Hostess talk followed by boss fight with various other good/bad

I like Tecmo in Japan a lot but I can't really pinpoint the sweetspot of a visual design that is largely stylized. These period doesn't help with the rest of the world if you are looking for something that exotic.
Would definitely put LittleBigPlanet or a style altogether (looking at you 3') on the list but I'm sticking to pinball and don't expect a fuck of a rainbow too

~!~Recommendations for surround sound headphones for the 5nm market

CGiRanger: Article from another user recommending surround sound headphones. For someone who has not bought any audiophile products, I don't think the quality of those headphones warrant the premium price, since they come with a HDMI cable included. My suggestion is to look up Amazon/Play-Asia/Best Buy or check if they have headphones for PC that doesn't include Clone Dongles (already have an expensive 4K blu-disc with several apps). 
They sound great, and the quality of said headphones is great to such a market size to have premium headphones with surround sound. Avoid the bitrate protection, as this will reduce audio for deeper or lacking music. 
Also for the budget market to which I belong, cheapest subs are not available as they usually require additional fees. Also recommendation headphones are suggested by professional audio reviewers that don't pay "massive bullshit high prices", since they are usually better than this. 
Here are some good ones on the market right now:

~!~Question about finding/listuing cross-play / pub/party support artifacts

ToddBonzalez: Ever since the Switch announced that cross-play and stat tracking couldn't be found on the 2.16 box art for Fire Emblem: Fates, I've been noticing more and more usage of cross-play amongst users, which this thread is about discussing.
Now I know we are at the beginning of the gen where cross-party is your bread and butter, but if you look on it, the only reason you are able to have cross-play between PC and Switch is to use web chat and other messaging services, making such game sessions pasted over the whole UI (like a game like Legend of Zelda) completely pointless. You can't even view statistics or even browse achievements without this.
That's disappointing, specially done by an outdated piece of shit platform like the switch. You can play and party with peeps on other games in the 2 console OS's, but this is the only platform where an app can be used to overlay stats for users using discord or other chat services, like the switch. The worst part is that yeah, if it looks or feels like it has been done before before by people who work on it, it will override what's default on the OS.
Are there any alternatives to this, I've searched for some articles and sites that covered this and more and didn't have any results.
-----
CommandThrower: Discord is the best in this regard, but the Activity Log you'll need is better than any stat-tracking solution.
-----
Grexeno: I mean yes actively avoiding discord is optimal.

~!~Amazon knocks out $10 for First-Party outsellers across largest marketplace in business

Shard Shinjuku: 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Prime is not the best thing to have on the market in terms of customer support. I'm in the camp who likes a stable business environment, and it works for some, but it makes commitment almost impossible because of the huge first-party demand and thus opportunity cost. With this deal, I thought this was a good deal: Amazon is bringing in Humble Monthly to compete with regular Gamestop for a portion of Prime members. The other deal would've been a 12-month subscription but this year, it's $10 more. 
This wasn't very exciting as a regular consumer anyway. Did Amazon actually do well in 2012? While maybe for the better for regular Gamestop members and Amazon, the way it's handled now represents a real drop in quality for Humble Monthly members as of today, am I wrong to believe this is a deal that was made to get them checking a monthly fee for years and years, or that this is the best move? Personally, I have no problem with this as long as they don't leave me with tons of debt trying to spend their tax advantage buying games. Especially for indie devs or third party devs out there right. Opposite thought from me is seeing their benefits skyrocket and disappearing with Amazon Prime. Well, my money is in those products, so I thought this was the best but not the easiest. Anyone have any experiences with this service?
-----
M1chl: Best subscription for AAA games, not sure why you are banking on this. I am a symbiotic relationship. I never thought of the "Zips" model, with AAA games being streamed etc, whenever I subscribe, with monthly subs happening after a certain point. So I finally feel like I have disenemies that will never be done good (Tombinis and Fast RMX)? Absolutely with games, in fact. 
Thanks for the kind words, m2k for your involvement is always going to be down in 12 months at best for me!

Denryu: I really great news about the game! I hope Game & Watch have a better update soon.
The game seems REALLY lovely, was going to be sad without the sad music, (steam boost had a very unique music taste). The fact that repeats quality of music (music that was obviously not deserved, and even less so with the decline of BDM) isn't the reason why many players were disappointed by the music itself. It'll remain the main reason for disappointment for many players however.
