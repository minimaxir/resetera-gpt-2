~!~What are your most wanted features from next gen consoles?

Cort: We all know there is an AMD rumor for next-gen consoles, but this doesn't apply to just multiplatform titles or the current generation of consoles (present). According to Windows Central, Team Ninja developing LittleBigPlanet 2 and Yoji Shinkawa hinting at Nioh 2 and other AI projects later this year. According to Kotaku there's also another round of rumors for next-gen consoles and there's recently aGI report from a few sources, but let's be real, wasn't it obvious at launch exactly when these last couple of gen rumors died down?
Standard Game
First one is Valkyrie Dust that is a first-person take on the singleplayer Binary Domain in Switch's format. A sort of endless runner but it's made by a couple guys over at Bluepoint Games. A lovely little FPS with a Yagami skin that runs at smooth 60fps on the system's hardware. I imagine there's gonna be a few more first person shooters and Armored Core again as well, but this wouldn't quite be in the same genre. This would be a first person shooter of a sort in the sense that there'd be an immersive aspect to be played in first person.
Debatable Game (No, this isn't a Metroid clone, this is a first person perspective)
LBP
This is a kind of "itch" game where you play as a robot android and tit for blood. It was well received at launch thanks to the Spike TV cast and this was one of the Koei Tecmo IPs I always hopped on to; some fans even backed the game so it got ported to several platforms. Sadly we haven't gotten a new LBP since. Even worse, it's been ages since BOTW but publishers still hold off and might well come out with LBP 2 in the not enough time (and possibly many not too much). It may have been a complete spin-off but EA wouldn't license the mechanics to a developer with money they actually want to cash in on (no big sequels, no big cash-in, etc, obviously).
Excibots
While it doesn't have 100% shooting physics, its playable single player is surprisingly good. Tons of room for creativity and variety.

~!~Path of Exile: Should I bother with this?

Disgraced: I play this game way, way, way too much. It's bloated, super grindy, absolute trash, and I'm not even joking. It's painfully painful all throughout my life.
How does it play?
It's a game where you get all the bad tidbits from 4.1 and was told I wouldn't get anything good from this, or never get one for this.
I don't fear for this, there's no chance in hell I'll actually get anywhere with this.
How do I get the best gear out of this?
...not here.
What the hell is the best gear in this?
Yes, it's not a completely random loot-canned game out there. Spiritual progression trees, what if chains are active and can grant you new skills and skills. But every wish dies once I actually transfer my stuff over.
How I can get a Fungus Man, from a bunch of rifts I found in Arch Temples I can turn into a figure

super-famicom: If you're against that, don't fret. Many good player will answer this question in the future with new information! The king will likely override forcing you to play a specific way?
It may be entirely you.
-----
Kojirospath: I don't care about ranked matches oranced play. I usually queue absolute crap. Taken up in playtime too much by MMOs I've lost interest.
-----
Disgraced: Obviously. As mentioned I want my crystal shards, high level crystals and high level artifact boxes to go on rotation and use up the falloff in powerleveling. Why bother breh
I was in the discord for awhile, personally. I also did like the run up and down, as you can see there's no checkpoint zones or anything in it
-----
JD2k: Yes.
-----
More_Badass: This game is sticking out the best way Activision can in a decade. You can't find modern players to play the old PVE MMO. It has all gems, but the game is a soulless trash heap of the old, so you don't even need to stick around for that long.
If you want all the content you'll have to sit around someone's table, drink a potion, and make sure they are absolutely

~!~How to play first Person Games with women?

leburn98: Warning, this thread isn't about first person games. I seem to find the first person perspective more preferable.
I'm writing this after having had the same experience of having the exact same experience with both the first person view and third person movement. Both of those visuals sucked. Both are flat out not enjoyable.
Prey has 3 in particular I'd say anyways. I really like it and I think it's one of the best side quests in the series (and a big part of the reason why it won GOTY :D). I keep thinking that people give it a chance, but when I look at the gameplay videos it looks average.
I wonder if anyone here who likes first person games can give me more information? I'm curious if people enjoyed the first person style of QTEs in this first person?
EDIT: I edited the post in question with “half first person”
-----
Memento: You can usually only pick 2 protags at a time?
2 I agree is pretty good. 
But usually you can't play like 3 or 4 until you get to the main character.
-----
Odeko: Reminds me of Dark Souls 2; I totally got that. It's a challenging game where you need to pick what sort of behaviour to show that dumbass circle jerk, but it makes for some genuinely interesting gameplay.

~!~DECOMPRESS WINDY-LIKE: NES "dream worlds" designs

Master Chuuster: Compared to the Intellivision, this one clearly lives up to its name. 
"Look at all the colors."
The two are by Neva Media, but this is reverse-engineered by Crytek for consoles. 
A powerful CUH-7200 processor, its case is al bott, something made out of glass or metal; not just a black background, but glass FiberMargon. In a particular case, CoM is what you would see when you look at a PressStop.
Sadly, it's out of print and not much has been released with 'enigmatic' said on Kickstarter.
-----
RatskyWatsky: Another thread explaining how amazing the Switch is. Not only is it the best model of all the NES/SNES Classics that I ever saw, but I want to get superstrained with emulation. Like a superfunded emulator trying to learn the NES/SNES Mini.

jwk94: Well I meant the NES Counter Strike game. I remember programming one for DOOM back when I had a 3D printer and found out that that it was worse for the original chip in order to have more possibilities just easier to use. But looking up online it can be design like: 64 countrums chips to manipulate with, without the BIOS, with varying only chip sizes of 11,16 and 32Gb (21,43u,6) for each label + cascading effects. And all back to back just to back.
People may argue the lack of NES Cartridges/NES Classic Computers means they are the best CRT support, but they certainly Revenge the System!
How about that Switch you speak of? Ghost Trick has some great games. Its one of the only Nintendo Home Console games not to the Yes list (Bedtime Stories, Evoland, Th Pokéfests, Fellini's Mystery House Confrontation).

~!~Is Haruhi Yamamoto (m9) going to lead Final Fantasy XVI?

Heisenburger: While we are all obviously down in the water with release dates and involved teams involved, it’s seems more and more likely that Haruhi will lead Final Fantasy XVI. The series didn’t really need a single player story game to finally reach the heights that it has and then struggle to find audiences.
And is that cause to be believed? Well...
In Episode 1, they hired English dub for the scene and the dub in-game almost sounded like that. This also makes the biggest question of the entire game (which won’t go down smoothly) moot.
You can now also expect another infamous scene telling the story of Squall and Renji’s wedding ~20 years ago. And tl;dr, the only way to know what this anime was while I’d be stuck in this thread

~!~Anyone single player using Microsoft Surface Book E+ yet?

SharpX68K: I know nothing about games, but boy am I in for having a gaming PC. 
I own nothing but a laptop, but I'm getting back into gaming after a long period on PC.
The Microsoft Surface Book E+ certainly isn't the place for gaming PC's. It's was around for a year where I am actually convinced I am the only gaming PC in school, or going to the doctor for an STD, so I'm getting something with the Surface tablet that I'M more comfortable with than a new job and mortgage.
But, ultimately, there is nothing really for me on that level. I will eventually move all the way to the most expensive a PC has ever been, so don't you think I should get something that offers that instead...
A gaming PC. I remember countless times with the Surface IRL Surface Lab (albeit with a very badly made fan) and the Lab itself, none of the other platforms I Go back to often lasted for a few years.
Not even anymore. Same goes for laptops. I know IRL Surface Z even though I let my laptop SilverSpec all these years ago.
I guess Reddit has a some quality of life stuff in it...
-----
SmartWaffles: Surface Book by a mile. Beats every other budget platform these days.
-----
Armaros: I assume Microsoft will tell you what the deal is now on laptop ? And if you suppose that number is higher than what you're basing your definition of breakable by.
-----
Mzo: I guess I've been chasing dragon ball and conceiving of something good to do with Surface.
-----
THE RABID MOOSE: I mean, depending on where you look, Surface can possibly be a viable budget compromise even if you aren't interested in gaming, as long as you play games on a supported PC. It's being marketed as two years old. Same as the Surface Book and Go Vacation. I've owned and purchased multiple Surface Pro or Evo WiFi Controllers. They are also supported pretty well, but considering you already have a bog standard PC and upgrading it to a newer laptop by like 2 years, you have a reasonable incentive to jump on the Razer, and I think, the price keeps dropping for no reason other than showing you the improvements you've been making are even meaningful.

~!~Do you think Infamous Second Son will be the PS5?

dimasok: 1) Small change.
2) Division 2 not using the BOTW engine.
3) First post won't use cloud play.
4) Native support for PSNow services instead of the XB1/PS now service restricted Cloud.
5) If Xbox prompts that you use a Plus sub etc. for the game.
What do you think? Do you want the biggest From Software game to be Infamous 2?
-----
GOTKNOWN: Yes, I just hope they're careful and it works well
-----
Patitoloco: Not really. First Half It's better.
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: Whats seriously missing?
From not including cloud or adding pay to win things. Or making some gacha system.
Because that goes for everyones in. Like lock them up or something
-----
LinkStrikesBack: Yes, it would minimize the frustration in having to download anything, at least on PS5 and cloud shit anyway it worked fine before
-----
Vaelic: I thought it was already confirmed for XB1

v_iHuGi: Nope.
-----
FarSightXR50: You will almost certainly need Xbox Live Gold, its a monthly subscription.
-----

vivftp: I get like 500 emails about the same thing just now. I thought maybe I was screwed, but in total I got maybe 10 - 20 different emails about it too, just not sending me anything.
I emailed them about 2-3 times until I got a response. Never gotten an email about it ever again. Oddly enough I think I'm always locked out of my own stuff, so maybe I'm just lucky.
-----
~Fake: I got a 600 kB/month email from them with the "Potential Slurp Juice" email verification code. when I signed in my account was filled with a verification code stating I'm ok.

Remark: Nah it happens at least 2 times a year. I got a 9 day Xbox Live ban for signing out too before Plus came out(to my knowledge).
-----
Cyclonesweep: Yeah me too
-----
Kraken3dfx: Nope. It happens pretty regularly, though all the time for a lock-in or lock down for security reasons. I've had to randomly lock myself in many multiple times.

~!~Subbed Re-Connect-Era - Re-Discovery, Mr. X

Xaszatm: Random people in here seem to be addicted to video-game-meets-similarly-simulation games, and this series caught my attention. Subbed, re-connect-Era is a high-strangeness sim about building your own home, going to the next step, living the dream. 
It started back in its 2015, Kickstarter, now in August, with a goal to finish within a year or so of its original release. What I love about this game is how intriguingly varied and clean, yet excellently constructed, you can go from one game to several on the go. The primary motif is a story about a villain who starts by slaughtering his peers and then decides to go on and slaughter everyone else planning with the final theatrics locked into him. 
It's a captivating and intriguing world. It almost felt like a side story seeing you build your household while making it yourself. It feels vibrant and fun. The house feels like a fully realized reality. I love how diverse the world plays out, how creatures and individuals from various species interplay and how one demon is more succubus than another. It really feels like what Nintendo would call a fusion of genres and ideas, with the former more action oriented as one of its characters. 
If you liked what I described then give it a shot, and don't let the bad design get to you and hear you say "I should play this/give it another go". It's entirely possible you love this game and it's not a bad game per se.
-----
FUNKNOWN iXi: Honestly. It's the only game from your list I care about, although I agree that you can cut it at any time if something feels off and it'll just derail things.
-----
Xavi: I really try not to read anything about it, but I missed a lot.
-----
Spinky: Excited to dip in and out of this, OP.
Here's some footage from my local game stores that showed interesting bits of it -- you can get some pretty good stuff like the Dennaton Gate minigame from the original, or Ikefaqs' Zora quest. The House in Fata Morgana is in an unused room like you'd get in in Shenmue.

Why I refused the challenge or some bullshit in the first place? Has your not trying to deny me my very special reward. Also case in point...

Forkball: If you want to see them in action they are doing this every time. Sometimes people purposely fail more times than I can tell you not how long it has taken but I think it is quite the thing for em ting.

Those who are in charge going at speed, better to wait a little bit and do the things in order.

~!~AT&X (ITAM) consoles in September: Avoid Best Buy's

Neoxon: I'm surprised that this strikes me as a particularly notable console focused thread since I think many of you will probably be familiar with BB's ACA Neo-Geo line-up. But just general insight on the AT&X line-up should bear in mind:
Now, I'm not going to go out of my way to demonize See No Get retail games to praise or diminish them, but all of the games available for my systems probably wouldn't be available without AT&X emulators by now (I myself can eternally dream of enjoying Zelda Skyward Sword without importing a copy), so I'm stating this not to discourage others with still consider them compsons for a controller. So we get the baseline of barebones ass releases (games where you litter the scratched side of the analog stick; games where KILL ME use a timer to give you a reason to do things or deep down plot) but with edits.
The mainstream appeal of the Wii/DS Virtual Console as a literal emulation system is undeniably augmented by AT&X or similar 3DS titles available for that system when it comes to 3rd party support. Including ports for Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, GBA (and 3rd party) emulators, and "emula's flood of games" of course.
For more discussion on this topic, please see the following threads:

~!~What timeline is the best timeline for gaming that on one hand is THE timeline of videogames, and on the other hand is a critically acclaimed book that on one hand is literally THE timeline of videogames??

KalBalboa: RE2, RE7, DMC5, Spiro remake, Sekiro, Bloodborne, GoW, GoS, RDR2, RDR3, FF7, and Dark Souls all released in the same order. Some say that the story started at the beginning and ran parallel with the story that eventually goes on to the end.
TL;DR: What timeline do you want Era to follow in its entirety or is it redundant?
-----
Aokiji: Chronological timeline would be cool
-----
Silvergun-Blue: It's the book.
No era hate, like the times before videogames as a whole.
-----
OrangeNova: It's the book.
But then again. It couldn't have happened before on the books. Pokemon's is the timeline.
-----
Falconbox: I could see The Silver Case being written differently because a while before Modern Warfare 2 came out. Also, the Halo Novel found its way into the Halo Gamescom trailer and into the Halo E3 trailer with the book. 
Strategy master plans was the mid 2000s, not super realistic due to heavy influences from the past, Assassin's Creed played with the rules of the Golden Truth: strategy battles, killing is always satisfying, and planetary empires are cool to build and space strategy explore...but when you're the AI, realistic time travel is the best option?
0:13 they should rethink the game's grim aesthetics, Sweden was pretty horrible in Nazi days and didn't have inter-city to trade with models from the Nazis who moved around. Well at least the cities were ancient stuff.
4:10 they should re-explore Tokyo, the city renowned for its war and economy since the 80's forgot about it when the warp engine was running out and they went visiting to it several times in the 80's+. The whole burnt through system needs to be put back.
8:10 they should tie the RE7 part to Tales. The book is smart, there should be a story to explain why Lara goes to hell and what timeline fucked up, after she returns to it her motivations need to be changed because no one denies she's doing the hardcore condition she mistaken while saving
====================
~!~How would customers feel if first party Nintendo games on PS4 "below expectations" sales figures?

GrayO_79: Having a big first party Switch title and also not selling that great after launch can be a realkward way to view your game offerings.
For example, there are a lot of Switch exclusives from third party publishers that are exclusive to their ecosystem because Sony have to focus all on first party. With titles like Pokemon, Bloodborne, Hollow Knight or AC Odyssey from Nintendo than from third party Sony games which don't sell well because of the lack of first party power. Especially indie ones.
What are your thoughts?
-----
Deleted member 42221: No, Nintendo Direct would be a time honored practice where, if I might be so inclined, my boss, I tells me that I'm interested in the game and tells me that, if I buy the game, it'll be there on release. In other words: don't buy when it's on sale.
-----
MELLO: That fifa direct was the same way lol
-----
cw_sasuke: Instead of listing third parties in the title...l the OP should also cover these publishers?
Let it roll.
-----
5taquitos: This isn't about the numbers - it's about who's able to gauge what and how high of a interest of a game (which usually is a last resort for devs) before the game runs out of production and sales drop, so somewhat predileptitious exclusivity isn't really unjustified.
PS4 sold well and will sell well in the period between now/then. If the shooter is on PS4 it'll be a reasonable target to target for third party releases, if not it's way too early to know what'll factor into a first party game.

~!~Nintendo Switch rise in selling power. How does it compare to all of the competitors?

Neoxon: We have had many people extensively responding to this thread, most notably the Switch market in general, but also the rumblings about the various competitors. Among the many responses were at Nintendo's FY19 results yesterday. 
Earlier today at around the 2:20:30 Doordos' Zeldas mentioned how Nintendo is getting more and more gamers to Switch. I was able to translate some posts in that thread by simply summarizing the following quote instead of listing all of the other responses below:
Also, there was another post last night that attempted to downplay the correlation between hardware and software (that was essentially nothing), stating just that software-based platform share is simply higher as well.
-----
kuroneko0509: and that's prettyinful and speaks for itself
-----
Video Games Are Dumb: Yeah, honest to god. If that correlation isn't actually the case it's kinda a weird correlation.
Fucking LOL.
-----
Kyrios: I mean, of the good ones, nobody uses Nintendo. The bad ones are the ones that just do work. Nintendo's got all the time people turning aloof
-----
Nuclear Muffin: Isn’t this just a result of the more open Nintendo ecosystem at their shores?
If you’re looking for reasons to hate Nintendo in general, you are sorely lacking in their openness... at least the fundamental reason behind Nintendo’s openness is novelty. The iOS/Android libraries on Switch have been overwhelmingly robust and varied, thanks to Nintendo being Nintendo. To call them “Standalone contenders” has been a mistake. They are now apart of the console race. The harmony between Nintendo U vs. other western third party publishers has only become stronger as the years went by, and now it’s fun to revel in each new industry and its characters even without Nintendo's ever really being involved.
By the way, regardless of your point of view, the Switch presents an interesting juncture in how open hardware can potentially be in the name of "definitive" PC gaming. Nintendo is simply existing, and having other players acomplished their exclusives. And it's not that it's pure perfection, but an evolution. So my point is: Nintendo has become equivalent to Sony, if Microsoft had not invented

~!~Does the gacha/wanderingonda effect by itself explain the story's?

SharpX68K: I was reading random manga that I’ve got lately and Chapter 7. Although, it was basically Prim--
Spoiler
...and it made me consider it could berupted.
I guess the thought is that there’s something more going on, and that focus on multiple phases instead of Critical (don’t know what the name of this function is) might explain some of the later missables, but, there’s all this extra complexity to Critical.
So... is the addiction hard to appreciate? Does the difficulty get balanced heavily if the game plays a lot? Is it possible to play a lot pressures of beating a boss just to challenging the boss, and and experience a whole new genre? Or is it a generous, well balanced strategy of sharing moves with your enemies?
Some Monolith Softy reviews I read highlight how hacking, triangular jumping, Photon arrow and so on don’t help much - you have to start slower, attack from far, and instead upgrade your toolset by doing these things.
I’m not trying to make a "know what" video about these sort of things, essentially. All I want to do is level up and change my strategy/playstyle taking these challenges up.
-----
lunarwhale: Yay, I listened! Glad it makes the game's (at least for me) story accessible to the mainstream now! I start as Therion/Sphinx/Ghost (original Pottu, not final or final) and able to remediate my skepticism, lol.
Also, with regards to "who were the Muvaman and what was the story like?" For myself, I'm embayached going from one character to another (Truman and Octavius appearing out of nowhere especially if my Line23 apologies me) and go from there.
For Martial, I have definitely experienced what the series is aiming for in terms of AI-like Musou from Volume 2 as opposed to whatever came first (I've been interested in seeing how they are positioning themselves historical and for Global Reach, but those would be another 2 mozle hints) but I believe that the Muvaman story FD/Stealth aren't entirely curious about the player's ability to engage in t A.
This thread is an interesting throwback and

~!~Anyone play Flight Simulator VR? How does it play?

trimon: I just got a flight sim flight sim flight game and it's fab. The controls works pretty well, tells you where to go and I'm the only one. I'm frightened by the OW simulator so I just found out that the simulation of flight simulators are good for flight simulators now akin to real flight simulators but I can see how Flight Simulator kind takes getting out of control every now and then. That said it's a flight sim so the misinformation on here is very entertaining. 'Flight Simulator VR' doesn't have any winged future release date so the game's as experimental as the Flight Simulator team seems to be really Early.
As other has pointed out, flight simulator on PC is a godlike experience for flight simulators. The best flight sims are ones that give you the control of the simpad and bumpers at the same time and alter the speed and course ala simpads. Then we're ones that still include flight combat but have some sort of restricted stealthiness that is so great it removes the need to maintain all the flight sticks.
So yeah, in order to be Flight Simulator you really really need the ability to engage in missions, take off and control the controlless/controls the devs made. So, in starting your journey on VR you're probably just training in 2 days. For a lot of flight simulators you actually need to get all the controls down before making the optimal custom controls. But for most flight sims, there's no way to get that when even on PSVR. You have to actually bite into missions.
So anyway, I just wanted to tell my squad (which includes 4 new player and 2 veteran) about this flight sim and what they've played so far. They (me) have fallen off a bit tho.
-----
Nitpicker_Red: Not in terms of the people I want to be involved with, flight directors aside.
But overall it was a cool game looking at the few me flew in the game instead of 4.
-----
Araujo: People spend lots of time on this game. 
 too bad the community defers to criticism and there was a lot of people in the community with aFlightBasic+ thru PSNow that kinda wanted to kick that trend in full off too.

JershJopstin: How many more things to hide...
-----
Kapryov: I have been sick and tired of seeing these posts in awhile.
To explain it simply:
It's the entire purpose of an algorithm to avoid people noticing something you tweet, and Google replies as quickly as possible after the news.
You can't hide advertising campaigns with subtle teasing without ruining the tone and atmosphere of the message. Twitter, Youtube, Steam, and Facebook all have this all behind the scenes, and they'll likely bite pretty hard.

~!~Sold my PS4 Pro, but I would like some game recommendations

Alucardx12: So I downloaded Monster Hunter World and heard a rumor that it will debut in 4k on the Pro. And I believe that since the game has had performance issues I would consider it a worthy upgrade if there is no performance issues.
I have some questions: 
1. Alright, let's get this out of the way, my Pro is a machine once in a while that will span 6 months. My previous model was broken and I had to replace it before Monster Hunter World released, but my replacement model remains in it. What should I get? I'd want something like a slim, which the game weighs less than 100GB on the card.
2. Any other PS4 spatsters you had?
Thanks. The actual process for upgrading from a Pro model to a Pro upgrade is pretty shitty. A friend of mine settled in the White Destiny Pro, and sold it, just in case I could keep it installed. And it took him a lot longer given his short tenure vs complete breaks too.
Thanks for the replies, Alucardx12 , any other ideas?

Azajabar: everything gets shifted when your ps4 just keeps shaking. It’s a problem with me from the moment I got it until now, both with my XB1X which blows my X360 up with how loud it is but also gets the turquoise noise

Admiral Woofington: Nothing. I didn' try Xbone X, but my OG Pro still does thay.
The poor form factor of the OG one really sux off. Plus if you play online on it with friends, it actually can become a hindrance in that way too.
-----
Alucardx12: The Slim is still super loud, but the entire ProPro form factor being an annoyance. My power banks are deaddd which while whisper quiet, is pretty annoying. I'd rather have a fried capacitor on my 4 year old crt laptop. I have a hardwired pc that has a solid HDD and this HDD always goes in and out continuously. So it hasn't been long at all.

Platy: It fucking makes complete sense to make a Kirby criminal every time

Igor: A all Nintendo. No soft lock ports, 1st party games, orphan matches and Double Smash. Just make it as good and polished as it can be. No hard lock anymore. There is a need for these kinds of games especially for those who never played the Classics before, and also for anyone who still plays high level karting games personally like me. Each of these games already feels incredibly good.

Parvaati: Honestly Nintendo should get it to everything at this point. Most franchises they’re too scared to put their name on it unfortunately, which in turn has affected their other multi-platform, console titles.

~!~Should I give adventurnity another chance?

Crackhead_Bob: I think it's common overseas for great games to release each year (and in most cases by region), (and sometimes even by platform / genre ), with multiple, original sequels. The original NES is one of the best examples, then the sequels get, and then the first-person games become an afterthought.
Popular opinion: If a game is great, its sequel should really be released in that state. I can't see a Smash Bros or Pokemon game being perfect, (even worse if Smash exists) but it backfires when it releases in the beginning because there's no middle ground. Even Popovers were by taking the best parts of the first two Popunos and made them go in opposite directions.
So, Era, which game are you most excited to see emerge? Do you have any examples of some other game (that you had no interest in) just begging for a sequel as well? Instead of just instantly copying Smash, will you do that?
-----
RochHoch: The Legend of Zelda
An amazing adventure once more, reinforcing the iconic tropes; it also has a brilliant, ingenious underdeveloped story by every statistical and scientific point of view; and probably the most mature and popular Nintendo franchise ever. But besides that, the Legend of Zelda remains a pretty good, in-depth but funny game, and we should be excited by it as well.
-----
Transistor: Not at all but it'd be a nice nostalgia trip
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
The best advice ever I've heard.. still one of the best in existence, if you can't handle the frustration. Far Share is worth your shameful investment. You have the complete dream that Nintendo never will win again.
So, based on physical units sales for press here.

Gevurztraminer: It's always been some bit of a fella, like Nintendo's IPs that most have no idea what they want to do or want to build off of, but alas, that was too much of an identity for Miyazaki to continue to expand a la Dark Souls in parts as well.

Chandler: Probably most difficult IMO. Just a relaxing game and I enjoy fighting alongside NPCs a lot, which is usually the preferred way for me to play. Some of my favorite moments will be when a quest I've had a few times in and I'm stuck in a dungeon for 10 minutes and then I rest for five minutes so I rest for a while.
When I'm stuck a few times I swear I'm just at a loss, I want to get better :)

Now I have so many games, and when I get home, something bulk cans make it seem it's gonna be hard hoarding, so I sometimes made a big pile of games for the night and decided to only go 1 person house, only needing 1 cartridge per household (difficult to be fair, we all own WiiU and 3DS around the same size) so I'm looking for furniture and furniture storage space to keep everything. Any recommendations?

It's shocking to assume they gave in and let people have 7-day stuff if they want to, considering Switch is already late with an almost useless 5-day (or there) to preorder the game and so the was never time to spend money on it.
I wonder if $10 from the campaign before tax would have saved them from their tax hole. Seems like their deals might have dried up.

We know they'll likely le

DieH@rd: Job Centric was already talking about this - the first line of he responses were a bit desperate. Happy for you and Fatshark.
-----
Mushroomer25: While the two already seem to be working on titles for the year in reasonable haste, I gotta agree on something a little more intangible: Sony offering a service to play all PS4 content is a scam because it makes people do the purchases regardless of whether they're on PS Plus, or on their system (IE: just check and see if you can access the PSN store and if you have it you get access). That's one of the biggest part of a service you can call a "real" consumer.
-----
P-MAC: Really impressive stuff, and I'd be happy to hear they had another 10 years of support to iron out some of the issues with PS Plus still - especially when other recent titles are still struggling with content and bugs. Excited to see on what Holiday drop we get, being able to play all our PS+ games is quite big until we hit the 2020s with the PS5. Screenwriter/Director James Marsden also comments with roundly worded apologists about lacking the content and he claims it will be offered in a different form when the service launches later this year.
-----
DriftingSpirit: I agree with him on the current status of the games as you kind of described it. It is part of the reason why I like to wait patiently for God of War.
I am actually surprised they have yet to launch those games on there.
The success of Shadow of the Colossus and Sunset Overdrive can be looked in another direction (or at least it can be).
And finally, as I'm writing this, I agree with him on the "too much getting used to" issue crop a few days after the press conference. Sony's grasp on features on 10/22/18 is wack. They still need to

Cantona222: These content-based dystopic worlds have no right to exist.

Budi: Thanks for coming and reminding me that the eco- nom genre is well founded now. According to the Awakening book about the mysterious and mysterious evolutionary changes that first sparked the "biosphere" theories (my favorite book about evolutionary biology), the earliest documented evidence for it dates back more than a millennium and has since spread to every corner of the planet, most of it independent of the animals and insects.
"our biomes reproduce a number of traits of the host and larvae that require energy to reproduce," Bozeman notes in a video response to Eldin Itzhik, one of the scientific expeditions of the late oriental era that explored the world after our era was ended. "And that's not just an isolated event. You know, this world had other races as well as other kinds of creatures. Before the appearance of the new world, it was thought that all those species had found a new place and learned to live in the new world."
The book, in brief, is very much a prequel.
And I think that the new world will be explored but it is part of a whole new biome (which island, sea-Marsh and the Northeast) -- unlike modern-day Australia -- with walled-carpeted cities inside and outside the city walls.

~!~ESRB adds Revert Review feature

Lant_War: This is the return to the old RE classic days. It's a neat feature that to give a nudge for re-replay. Currently pulling up the RE1-7 Collection and reinstalling 0.
And before you say it, its one of the few things on the PS4 that don't play terribly.
-----
Cess007: For those that played RE6, that's not bad. Although I'm underwhelmed by the start of the remaster.
-----
sixteen-bit: Prey was my first exposure to this franchise. Hopefully my memory is funny.
-----
Galkinator: SOTC is pushing this as a really great game
-----
Xyer: I loved Leonphrine back in the day. Going back to RE 1 to 0 is a great idea. I'm psyched to give RE Legacy another go.
-----
Falchion: That's a big shame.
-----
TinTuba47: RE3 has the best classic RE gameplay imo
-----
Serpens007: Man, I really liked LTTP back in the day. loved it when I played it. it's not a bad game, just not as atmospheric as the old ones.
-----
The Last One: Yes, it was better imo, I just had a much different opinion on it back then.
-----
SweetVermouth: Hmmm. HLTB does get RE2 for me personally. But I didn't see a lot of RE games around that time so I figured I should check REmake for the third time.
The first time I saw RE7 I was really shook my head a bit. I think on release they fixed it though, I remember thinking I was crazy.

====================
~!~Should/can I hold down a button to run?

delete12345: I think we deal a lot of similar arguments, to various levels. For me, when you think about it, I would feel like I would not be able to run this game (even good games), because I am usually fairly far/mascot in terms of my pace and flexibility. Any option, which can only be a button I presses?
I am just curious about what you feel and if it's worth it.
-----
brokeastronaut: Yea, I feel like blocking only for fast travel is harder to do in ES games than ES others in general. But I would never turn on the fast travel if you need to run, or even for that matter take any fast travel in a ship or short corridor.
-----
jot: I agree, though blocking for fast travel is definitely more annoying. 
For RPGs you can't really do fast traveling, fast travel is purely Bandit/Class Piece-based though.
-----
Mikey Jr.: I feel like I'd be incapable of fighting in combat outside the special you don't get the correct quest post to prevent combat from stealing shit.
Either way, I always had this one steampunk style big adventure game with the first two tri force heroes to do it.
-----
Lump: It's pretty easy to get lost and lost in the game world, it takes like 30 minutes to get to its point. Unless you want to tell every town you'll find eventually to run, it can get infuriating.
-----
roguesquirrel: I frequently see people that the game prompts them to every town they will enter in ES Oblivion they can literally lock the conversation away. Got through a playthrough on PC in 360 days and did not think the prompt would make me lose track. 
On the PC version, the instant dialogue option and wild card options are typically there, if these options yet exist. I blew a town of bandits on mine with the iron armor and kept wanting to check others nearby to see just if these townsfolk reported it. I especially want at least a horse so that I can quickly get into combat without a fear of dying.
-----
Hooks: Elder Scrolls 3 seems to have automatic fast travel considering that it’s not in the game. It’s incredibly good for Oblivion.. its ending was stellar.
You either power through

Voyevoda: Samus: Drop frame rate? I thought they could have cut into the player's perceived time with Hunters, but we were locked in 60 fps, even on a TFA. Even the frame rate is delayed. The last time they bundled Samus herself in a suit that was reminiscent of Metroid's, with my preferred suit being Turf Wars.

~!~How does a console software have so many documented properties than a handheld console?

Phantom Thief: That Final Fantasy 11 screenshot, seeing as it was an 8-bit game, was literally WAAAY before the PSP. 
Yes, that was a 30-second CG commercial, fam. That one was supposed to be released in 480p and added a few new parameters to the PSP that were not possible before doing a full-fry on a handheld release. The one thing that could have obliterated a Vita library being released on a handheld was adding 100s of hours of virtual music/graphics that was new, and besides the rumors and faithful emulation of the game, there didn’t seem to be any new code or updates to add more popular features, so I was hesitant going in. Thing is, I wanted to play the good old game, the Wii Zelda, so I figured I would get myself excited and open the box and check every dressing bug I saw before putting in all the money I needed to buy it. 
So I did what any open world game does, and found the cover and interior shots of an Okami action game beaten up in 4K. The game is already engineered as an open world game before, but the map is hospitable to 1080p resolution and adequate HDR and HDR beyond. The IQ for the game overlookes the minor lighting/other minor details, a single slip up screen has the hotel code glitched out, the game crashes when it tries to use any memory or resources, the option to disable VO

~!~Help me burn onto Pasties~

sugarless: So anytime Illuminand, I just realized that I have yet to participate in a group with some of t's in game members.
Now, Illuminand is not for newcomers looking for a group moment to learn is.
One of their old members making this thread tried to blow my mind off by saying "Illuminand would play a lot of Silent Hill". Well, I have to yes from your point, I want to but it's against the rules.
I don't play horror games often but I enjoy the way they can be used to chill. I also just wanted to say thank you my friend for helping me get me into group on here.
By the way, I'll start, I have a least 2 franchises where I try to play these horror games, Silent Hill 1-3 and then a few different games like Homecoming but all I can remember of that time actually stories from kinda meh settings and not horror but atmosphere, the games inspired me to eventually try playing horror games but I'm never going to play them. I wonder if II did this I wonder if there's some kind of special coming of cry from immaturity trailer the creators made or when the bond stopped.
Thing is Silent Hill fans, you know the people ruined you forever because something to avoid are still things to discuss about. Git flibs.
I've seen people leave their stubborn habit and after Silent Hill 3 came out people would stick with it but yeah I had to leave. I'd almost love to just get to Silent Hill 1 again and have the "hope you made it" moment again. Would make for a perfect group unlike Homecoming and Homecoming did more harm than good.

~!~Collecteding Hollow.

Hektor: So i finally started Hollow 'n' Clock this week, granted its more simmy than most recent metroidvanias, but its really relaxing. The games start after that and that brings you towards the big melodrama of the main story, but when you play it that stops the loop the way people tend to forget.
From what i've been able to gather under the tree 'N' Clock has a broad array of surprising twists,pokemony puzzles and magic puzzles.
Beautiful overall atmosphere too, i just love when metroidvanias profit with the quiet atmosphere and all melodramatic overworld and shrines, but Hollow N' Clock was different to them. First person view is YOU, you have to mess around with pots and you have to aim your weapon at these. Since you stumble around you have an almost Pacing Table when to Mushroom mines and it doesn't live up to its OST, however once you get used to it you get some enjoyment out of the game.
There are 30 unique Items so far, each containing different elemental resistances, friendship accessories and magic accessories, items that perfectly enhance the experience when you'er explore, discover magic and Charm words that you didn't know you wanted, and truly dwelt in a Hollowan world and need to surp
-----
Hektor: Actually recommended
Yeah that game is fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it a lot, especially in coop, raising each level to a max of 10x difficulty levels, then there was a boss that stopped the game at 10x.
Its not heavily in fact the hardest part of the game but its great if its not a rush.
-----
CaviarMeths: Their coffee break gameplay is actually excellent. Worried playing a match of harrow since the floor was so slippery I realized I was the only staircase and not a single light was visible in the air at once.
A great balance imo. Fights/moves will never incite me to wander off, as each move I make feels fresh and I fairly maintain control over where obstacles should be hiding.
My only point I'd make is to return twice to the Hollow Port so I can try in-depth exploring the metrodvania world. Loving the fast-paced combat and physic-immersion that new exploration offers.

~!~Is Square all right with hating on all anime?

VanCityGamer: A few weeks ago I noticed that my friends comments while playing the Noben bash SMT remaster seemed to make everyone mad, I thought maybe they are all right with witnessing anime shown on television, as the nuam period started to the point where Pokemon, Mega Evolutions, and the army of them began to get more popular. Everyone seemed to like the series even though one comment in particular convinced me to give it a shot. I would play it during my commutes through town rather than a subway. Many were saying that the story logic Keynote gave was superior than the final cut, and that because of the remix, the Megatons are out of favor with later Pokemon. To certain that Magnemite is here, that argument isn't valid anymore due to the shutdown of the Let's Go games.
On one level Kanto and Azumarill call a good game, yes I know it is designed in a way that makes the lack of rewards on the level dictate the gameplay, but Kanto is all right while losing an entire ecosystem which allows teams to experiment so much more with content. The story for Kanto has a degree of supernatural horror as well, where any failure ending up costing you a trip to Staryle's dungeon, and the game has not played well adapting to change player's habits. There are seemingly a few player choices recorded in cutscenes that end up in the final battle...is K and not always K and never backward seems very weird, but they didn't always Capra and it makes all the strongest Pokémon fanv-a-tron. 
Quite frankly I don't know if I am completely wrong and I am liking Kanto, yes I love it. Whilst some of the main appeal seem steep...I cannot answer the other questions. Is Kanto in a better shape this time? I am getting competitive this year!Sandfox Engage is interesting Sheng Long.I honestly didn't care if it wasn't the credits but it just made the snowboarding game radical - Is Korg.anbe sure?Was going a bit realistic but got tomorr

~!~Dark Souls - Is it possible to Brutally Endure a Sackette? Let's see how Bloodborne's big challenges will play out

More_Badass: Behold!
You could, as in, run from NPC's in a shackles, open chests, and destroy or stow away useless junk away when not hungry for more! And bosses could, if you wanted to, prioritize giving the player a stronger weapon to properly run from that requires to do so, rather than resources that you might want to they desperately need to do first. The solution to all of these challenges, previously been covered in the OT, includes you passing through a stinking fog-chamber filled with deoctething magics and casting enchantments, laying off all of the resources at your disposal until you are almost certain of a drop of blood, and finishing the rest of your stamina bar with azzle of blood.
If you're going for the platinum trophy, however, you won't be able to walk into enemies teleported (possible items) to death. Brain-dead enemies that start melting head-on while you're exploring the unhooked pit. Blood-borne lore expert S.E.B.*
Spinicking might be the right place to pick him: 
Spoiler
I do admire the flamenco bandages they didn't use for every cutscene in the game and I’m guessing they didn't even use one this time around. Maybe if S.E.B has unique moves now, he’s already a true killer, right? 
I can see a location that seems insurmountable as a challenge, but this is where I’d hard pass using the fog-chamber system to gather and throw blood at foes. Same with sneaking and/or floating spheres, segments of which cause you to fall from great heights. Or, depending on your ability, threw back and spit out plasma balls from a helicopter.

~!~Do you seriously don't have a "good friend"?

Sabas: I've played games for the longest time in my life, but there are times I need a good retweeter in my life and I want to record something, but I can't remember the name of the game I need to play and I don't remember half of the chances of getting it. So, I-what? I DO have a good friend who bought me a bunch of games when I was bigJB, but he hasn't bought or played the games for years. Whats the deal? Do other people care like this? Do different videogame types can still hold my attention?
TLDR cause my averagemate doesn't really care about video games I don't care about. I have good memories of our era but there are times where I feel my age just means *i* weird, or for some Sonic game. But mostly platformers, racing games, Team Fortress, Civilization, Zelda, racing games...There's Final Fantasy but it's very hard to get into I don't know.

For me BGS' basic package has three viable weapons.
I have gathered three more perks perks perksick. I have gathered four more perks perks perksick. Jackpot-style hotkey machine, limited-time limited-vote cam
-----
Basileus777: Give me something that looks like a gas can. Also, a gas can is all I need.
-----
Rodney McKay: In 5,000 years I'll probably just get the Compact SMG instead. Depending on the gunner build, it's possible that I'm missing all the perks.
And with the new MP, I also only need the sprint and the building Smithy which I don't care about.
With all that said, I do think there are still quite a few weapon types, and often a combination of the three (Jackpot, sidewinders, shocktrooper kevlar and a downtown core... all of these weapons can also be used with limited ammo, so a full arsenal means not having three as much sway as other weapons in a multiplayer environment. Also, with SA-120 being the standard, I feel there's a lot of utility in the guns other than sheer firepower. 
Fallout 4 could be a good starting point to learn this pretty often.
-----
Hammee: Mine is good, will pick it up after I finish BLIZZARD. At the very least, with the Lock, your character will be unlocked from the start on your first run through. Early in the game is when certain NPCs give you quest advice that you won't forget and level up on your first playthrough visually shines through. I wouldn't worry too much about difficulty level and I tend not to pay any attention to when a single player game is being developed.
-----
Beef Stallmer: One of the options on your list to get is GRINER. It's the one mod that really took me by surprise first time I played with people. Guy teaches mod beginners how to play the game on the PC, so this has always been the one I'd recommend for me.

MadMike: I go with the SMT4 Specializations mod.

====================
~!~The Last Of Us - Ellie's appearance is somewhat disturbingly tame compared to the Book of N

Phendrift: Take a gander at this shot:
It takes the less discussed storytelling from the 2 games (which I don’t think was entirely her sexuality being connected, but rather between the two rather than a straight line to prove Ellie is the protagonist). Figured it’d be a less horrible comparison due to Ellie new abilities being in the first game but the way the movieEmbargo is set up in extended story details, I think the performance isn’t quite as bad’s too, her voice gets points to incorporate then well maybe a full set of moves (which would make fantastic use of the story telling power), but the scenes not quite in the same manner are not enough to sustain the movie’s narrative... it hits a small snag while also alienating the potential of the relationship having developed. I have to admit that feeling great about her playing a part for Hosea in the first game was impressive knowing she’d still be bonded by Joel.
In the immediate for the trailer I see Ellie playing a role in Katelynge Corryone’s ship lab , where we marvel at her becoming an alien having agency - She can determine what is on the surface or beneath its surface with video chat. She has excited concerns about other creatures beneath the waves of investigation, where she feels like her existence is being caused (under attack) by other animal agents and not just this object... the screams. 
I get that this would be careful with regards to animals being used, but every game let’s treat creatures as tools, not objects. I just feel while Joel pulls off weird spectacle moments she’d bad posture with the slow pace of a human being so the storyline could be a bit more fleshed out for the new trailer. 
I’m quite excited about the potential of the relationship building seen in the new SH experience, but the relationship aspect does NOT sound powerful, not by a long shot but curious in execution. 
Question!: How is this encounter in particular controversial ? 
Thanks!
What do you think of Endgame’s evolution and the trailers?

~!~Consoles for the GameBoy (Gold) are now strictly sold at retail

Hero of Time: Via NetEas
 $99.99RRRP and Elite price was updated.
I wonder what the new prices for Gold and Virtual Boy are for now.
-----
GameZone: Anyone even buy the majority of that?
-----
Hero of Time: I think the only source I know of was someone who joked about how Nintendo was actually putting in the new GameBoy franchise on the secondary market and retooling the existing GameBoy Advance line up.
-----
ShinUltramanJ: GTA 6 = happy.
-----
Artcipation: Not the GCN.
-----
metsallica: Do you know those Pokemon games where the prices literally had no limit to print and were just flash carts?
-----
Hero of Time: I dunno, I think the previous games were priced accordingly for home use and were obviously for kids. But those actually were Zeldas and Nintendo saved the money in return.
-----
Parvaati: Even more evidence of the flight to digital states where digital is abundant.
Digital still wins *wars*.

KDR_11k: It's decent enough for most people though, if something is cheaper than the content right next to it, there's an audience.

~!~GungHo works hard to fix DK now a 'platformer FPS'

Aswitch: During its launch is is working on sure getting better roll on its KOFXC port. its available on their site  ( not the poll I see on the top right hand side). The founder is working on changing the visual quality and atmosphere to a platformer that plays best platformers ever and in doing so aims to release say DK a platformer-ish frog with Krazy Ones on Terry's Quest.
Attackers may not be holding your hand ( maybe there's one on the platformer level as you can see), but it seems this will be one we have seen from a lot in the Jet Set Will Fly and Metal Slug games on the Nintendo 2DS.
-----
labpleb: PLEASE KID READ
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Hah, I was wondering this too as well.
-----
Dusk Golem: The issue might only exist in DK, but other than that I think most people just called them wallcops, we've sort of known since word dropped about it in E3 (though stuff like that is a bit sudden).
-----
Dekuman: You are forgetting a property I can see being developed where the sequel bug will have huge negative impact on the first game. One half of the years of enviroments for DK have been filled with marathons and exploiters. As something that is developed by SW development teams and is addressed in patches on the back of the 2ds.
-----
Don Fluffles: So you're saying you feel at least as mad as people to not let people know that a DK with Krazy Ones exists?
And who pays for these updates and development. They're paying for the development, not marketing.
-----
MP!: haven't run into this yet so dk11 From the little info we have I can see this being very different from the title that came and gone. like they don't owe me shit
-----
WonderLuigi: IT ALL CONSISTENT? WHAT?

Servbot24: This is incredibly ignorant but I find it hilarious that this is a metascore site and we get 100% positive reception from users when in reality we have reviewer saying the exact same thing.

Is its Krazy concept? Yes

~!~U$ta Rune Story is supposed to be F2P by now?

Sterok: Link
Link
SpartaGaming commented that in the recent earnings report regarding Switch revenue, they said this should be the first indication that "this game is F2P."
Anyway, are those accurate? Are some of the recent updates really giving you reasons to buy? I can't find anything about the game at all.
-----
antitrop: Wow, that's probably accurate
-----

Tfritz: More like F2P? Would that mean we could actually have multiplayer on the Switch? 
Not Pro owners, if that's the case.
-----
Jawmuncher: Just when I thought Animate Royale was gonna be it just saw some of the comments. I believe it referred to the news about there being a different game than that and that you can play without pro as well.
If true, I'd start questioning if SteamSpy.com has technical issues for this kind of feature.
-----
Takahashi: It exists for if you log on uplay and enter the eshop.
-----
CognitiveAtrophy: I'm not sure, but I don't know if this was what I was getting myself addicted to at first. I started Dunkey's review for the game prior to it being F2P, but then apparently he got to the point where he kinda lost interest. I wonder what the avg working out price at 8-9% discount is for right now.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: so it's just a one time price drop for some points too?
For example in the US it's $39.99
In the UK it's 22.99
edit: The differences here are huge!
-----
Cartridge Games: Dunkey likes the reviews so probably some you don't like
-----
futurevoid: The price increase more than made up for the cost of keeping it F2P and I'm still not happy about it.

~!~Dark Souls author James Rolfe hopes talks about the Warcraft franchise...

Dylan: The internet is certainly watching. So what better way than to make a thread about Dark Souls, one that doesn't have been in a thread like this for a long time.
Although Warcraft is an IP that origins when many, if not most, people at ___ play in it ironically, and did not return to it.
You might wonder why any good would hey care about something so one of the members of manufacturing scum interested in doing away with Genji and Magic? Gatcha was a mistake. Even mass layoffs and a loss to the developers and their ability to make money no longer lead. 43% of the development team was out of work, dropped that figure to zero. And the studio had to agree to a lesser budget.
...Wait, and they made things even worse? Nothing was cut. It was an Acclaim only commercial. You can shut your virtual gifts until your checks go away. Only the employee janitorium remained to case anything asexual! Yet, one day, an anonymous mail somehow sent a mail through a payment processor, asking for thoughts?
The hacking scandal shook this company.
Reading your news, you would expect the news from 29 October. Yet, your company got marooned... On the 22nd, it said anything against Cyberpunk: **Sanity risk”. As even now, they sold the shares and loss was already taken! Publishing was. To top it all off, they don’t care! Namco Bandi’s lawyers told the concerned company that there IS big news. And Seven years ago only Niantic predicted things like Pokemon wii
-----
Gray: With how games have grown since the 90s and what things Namco did that you need to be a company to care about you only need to care about what is mentioned, because nothing has be for you.
-----
Zalman: Look at the success of the smartphone and simulation games. Switch stands at the beginning of this gen.
-----
sir_crocodile: No one cared about Warcraft until Warcraft III Reforged was released. What a disaster.

TooFriendly: That's stunning evolution graphically speaking. But is that the problem? We're all thinking in motion. Are we at a point where there are games that'll be available any time?

~!~Pokemon Let's Go and Gen 1 fans: Does the Switch Pro/Elite get there?

CormoranStrike: I see multiple people being elated about the news regarding Gen 1 Pokemon and about Gen 2 Pokemon, specifically. Everyone saying other 2018 games look very impressive is a pretty good reason to me, but is there an article or did something happen at E3 where E3 passed, where announcements got announced to put Gen 1 Pokémon on the show floor, or something? I want to try and find out when you, the attendees, feel like it.
-----
Knight613: It's kinda weird I feel like some people on one side and media on the other tend to ignore this.
-----
delete12345: Yes, it does to the sheer elitism of some very passionate fans.
-----
Jon Carter: I’d like news about Gen 1 Pokemon.

Ravelle: I think the same thing would happen if you tried to turn the beats on the Bethesda magazine E3 conference and there wasn't Pokémon for Nintendo direct carrying it's event out from June to August and it was Kid Icarus.

-----
JaeCryo: Great article about this area. Frequently there (at least to my memory), one of the four towns I progressed into in GTAV was surrounded by cannibals. Thus, I constantly had to drive past them, to swerve between Swope and Moors.
This isn't just a skimming of a horde, I encountered a whole horde circle. There was a herd of caravans, racing past me at almost the same angle every time. I only lost about 20 minutes, the only times I thought I had seen them was when I came by to head they had structures collapsing. My last encounter was running into cover and I was fighting like 3 guys at once. Worst was, one guy had enough armor to turn me about 10 times and I didn't even have the best armor for him. I was bulldozer at 11 bursts, had to time my shots and rush him, doing that 10 times in a row. Another time, that guy had heavy armor, and I couldn't HEEM him, I just ran away, taking his bullets out through his armor, and this happened.
Few tip's:
Hole up on the rock in front of Morro's house before entering the prison. There the player character comes back in, and your bandicoot fill with silver, and you can see cool stuff fall from the sky. A few things I like:
I let them all drop off, and also filled with things to craft crafting things with, so they stay far away from previous gear, so crafting what you want isn't a problem.

====================
~!~The Virtual Boy. Like a great game.

Charizard: So I bought a Virtual Boy at my parents' place, bought me some memory cards (don't have a brain, but it seemed vaguely useful), and now I can finally experience playing a game that I reasonably could have played on a real console with proper controls. I thought it would be a neat niche device but yeah.
The reason I thought it was a good game is because I never actually cared for the Virtual Boy.... until I have recommended it to my friends. Being a kid that was always down for a nice 2D platformer (I LOVE Bubble Man) and Dr Laplac at the time said "yeah thats cool", I just kind of expected it, but when I actually proceeded I was met with a lot of fluff and praise ( for the time I spent on that game), even if I still think the original wasn't really that great.
Here's the thing: on the original the backgrounds were CRT/high res. The screens looked sharp and cell shade. They ended up being terrible in quite a few places. At first I just couldn't handle the background being CRT/HDR. The background and / or backgrounds warps if you pan around but I couldn't take divine engine screenshots (they were the real shit after all). The screen cap is real, but otherwise it was very muted.
Then came Donkey Kong Country 2. My old jaw a broke, so I went "ooof" and made this update: my native res was 100hz. Game was actually running at 800x600 when I played the first DLC, but game itself was the exact same as the base Lite model, still ran great all the way (except to a sub 4k smoothness setting). A couple of things had essentially been remedied in the new Lite, but which one that?

~!~What are my best completions of indie games right now?

Krejlooc: Hi All.
I have been curious what are your best, traditional completion of indie games for the last few years. I feel like doing just that was a bit unlikely to me because there aren't many builders/indies that match the quality of craftsmanship and ideas of prime games itch for some love.
Granted, my best pulls from indie game development and tinkering, including visual expression and music, but all was a bit limited, so I worry that if I do just a fraction of what the old boarder games had, I could break past those confines.
Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

I’m in the middle of pixel boy which I was about 5-6 months ago so the gameplay is somewhat familiar but the variety was within. Now more and more people are starting to play it aganuinely though so hopefully it won’t take that long for them to

signal: Moogles is a hot name. I didn't even know they existed. Are these some really good pixel art puzzlers? I quite like their aesthetic/obscuring when im playing.
They're easy to get into of course.
-----
mogster7777: Not gotypixel and lite zero interest in this one? Another one that crawled to the top of my list. Just wanted to see HiNX and hope they made the game right as well.
-----
signal: I think they don’t have that style to explore these kinds of genres in a good way but it’s great for both those reasons alone.
They’re both good and they’re all pretty low effort too. A little more depth here and there.
Also ridge row. Yeah maybe not a lot of those are out there but it’s intriguing and a little less simple than the first.

~!~Blazing Chrome - VR Developers Whose Dreams Doesn't Die

Chaos2Frozen: A developer came along while I was at work that expertly played through the infamous Broken Chrome using VR. Thought it was cool of them to put in work, but he's just some folks.
The Smash games are over for the others while I was on lunch shift. I've picked one up that I'm playing, thought yesterday it was a Mario Kart clone and straight after I just saw the developer donate some of these to mental enourmities.
There's some major spoilers in the title, which I suggest readers respect that you get to decide whether or not to do the game your way. The emotional part of this sounds like its relatively easy to pull off so people should be aware!
-----
KratosEnergyDrink: It sounds like I'll be around if this kind of project becomes a reality of yours - why not top secret stuff like creating level layouts with the vision of a scene in-game that would be super cool.
-----
DarkDude: It's really weird how difficult stuff like this must be for those prone to this kinda of thinking.

~!~RTTP: Sands of Wyd... and how it made Pools of Terror infinitely replayable

oni-link: I don't think most people read a game history book, so I thought I'd give this a spin
In light of this, what other games out there have made overcoming difficult obstacles fun and even very challenging?
I'd like togger this off as big as the ones you've listed, but I'm not too keen on getting my ass in steam and getting really really creative with it here and there
Start with the original Legacy of Kain games
I can't really remember off the top of my head:
Paper Mario
-----
Tizoc: Yes please. I don't have that kind of nostalgia for those 2, as I feel them to be the best but my initial enthusiasm died with them.
Paper Heroes is my preferred due to its difficulty and shrinking puzzle rooms.
It plays like you'd come in force of Paper Mario - not terribly complex (though levels and puzzles are reminiscent of Mario) and nicely balanced, with many neat additions like the widescreen automatic split screen, a decent amount of minigames, etc., and feels just a bit more satisfying than Metroid Prime, in terms of tension and replayability.
Has a really good OST (although some tracks are just...off)
If you haven't played those on disc yet, I'd highly recommend them
I beat a few variety of games, and RAMn right off the micro, here's a really good rendition of the game, minus loading times:
Wailingerton is perhaps my favourite boss, it's just so fucking difficult but so satisfying to go through and its level design is tight and fun
All in all, it scratches that Metroidvania Metroid itch so well
-----
daninthemix: I'd add the Lost Kingdoms series -- which is also amazing. To RPG, by the way. In the RPG department you can play Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and all the Tales of games. Nine Hours' level design is incredible, and the infomercial shoutouts to Seven Waints and Realms of Ambition helps to narrow down the JRPG sound bites to the half-decent and IMO great level design that combined design throughout the eighties.
-----
Metalgearmiyamoto: Try Symphony of the NIGHT or Angel of Darkness. They have fantastic short and really great stories in them.
====================
~!~Cancelled on Kickstarter: "All of the above are how these games should have been. All of them."

PaulloDEC: It looks and feels terrible for the reasons you say.
Your anonymous backers promised compensation for the cancelled Dead Cells... to be precise, perhaps the game had to die what so about games with promises of smaller budgets after their launch?
Now I'm a big ol' no body Jim and UMvC3. Why do the few people that have the cheeky smiles after I brought up the KS campaign and said to them, 'just play Dead Cells', being instead of immediately enjoying it'...'no?' and they've already forgo their $120 unsure hand and only seem aware of it.
I like my fellow backers, but I treat every backer as my equal and am really surprised to see that the community, especially at large, has been really tasteless and dickish.
Ridley, if you would kindly ask me, isn't the hype for this game a joke? Any idea why I'm asking?
-----
vestan: Dead Cells is just the best VC game so far. I don't trust them to make a worthy sequel. Awful.
-----
Imran: I think this was always a point they're taking for updates and the closest we'll ever get is a remake of the demo, yeah.
They're probably not capable of developing according to their deadline, but they're like a few years behind on updates.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: I remember Prince of Persia Sands of Time.
DOA is not dead. Certainly never has been. 60 issues and 10 new games like this are planned. Of course from name and function to games they're just the most basic of the bunch based on “relaunch”. Which are their own thing.
-----
Zoon: Exact premise of DLC they seem to be chasing. VR? They got some Rocksteady with Riddick in Batman not too long ago. Hrmm that sounds like something good.
-----
Jasbasse: They're making Dead Cells. Can't wait for that joy-cons port. DC that is!
-----
z0m3le: There is no point in answering the question about the basic premise if they're going the Kickstarter route for a new VC game--they did have plenty to develop. They've said they had some

The era of Luigi: G It's that time again, the industry's most liked videogame, having sold 1.5 million units in its first week to become last year's best performer.
Proportionate upspalenge
Prices of games are up 15% and the sale volume is 100% of sales volume now.
Guy previously said that share of digital sales grew to 120% when compared to last year. Those numbers are certainly impressive.

~!~PSA: List of Forza Horizon 4's Cars Season Pass and Hot Wheels Wheels Enzo

Dancrane212: Note: Forza Horizon 4 does not include season passes for 4 cars. You will see a car tier overlay on your dashboard.
All three seasons are available for laps listed as 10 entries. FH4 is devoid of cars. Forza Horizon 4 will only include one entry per season for owning rare cars.
Xbox One, Windows and Origin All Stars All Racing Bundle will give you 6 cars for 4$.
Edit:Flashpoints for language:
-----
Windrunner: Absolute garbage, every time.
Also, Niafero is a now a heroin courier.
-----
Van Bur3n: It’s a justified amount of gray. I spend most of my idle time in one game doing one thing. Play FH4.
-----
bsigg: It's been 3 years already since this brought us back to 'Mark of the Ninja' and in that time, we've been spoiled by a bunch of good releases like Earthbound and The Messenger.
-----
Ametroid: No more to say it's super packed and having the same amount of content as FH3 will make 4´s bundles feel fresher
-----
Dancrane212: Rebought from PS+ and after all these years passing it's finally pushed me close to 7.
Let's hope I get to the Car Pass this year.

xrnzaaas: One year on I'm getting a bundle... :(

I Wanna Be The Guy: Peach and Daisy are getting ripped to shreds soon form the new Mario Kart. All this delicious goodness is coming to Switch this year.
-----
Zalman: That's not Peach's mouth, were you.
-----
Hieroph: The new Mario that everyone should stop asking for already.
-----
RyoonZ: This aint even gonna get hype but those mouths still work!
-----
Awakened: Wow that was better than I expected. Normally this would mean that because Nintendo doesn't care about video games that all these great Nintendo-focused remakes will show up and one after the other who looks at Mario Maker and says "well there are just as many models as this." But I'm ONLY here to remind that this is no new premade game and yes these are all delicious looking. Bring 'em on.

~!~My Pro controller is dead :(

Zetran: What the fuck is this bullshit?
Rechargeable Battery? Have I missed something here and there?
I'm wondering if the issue is actually a fluke or something and I'm dead. These controllers never die. 
My Pro Controller breathed so much life into my gaming sessions. I spend so much time playing competitive and fun games. I'm hyped to jump on my Switch Pro Controller.
Trying to figure out if it has a fire-up or what is going on.

CannonFodder52: Hmm.

An easy way to play is to connect a PS4 controller and it to your controller.

~!~Lumines Remastered Announcement Trailer


Vic_Viper: I could hear the title over my saturn. Looks great so far lol
-----

====================
~!~How is the hang fire remaster? Or can you remap?

ussjtrunks: I've been playing the PC version again and one thing I've noticed it's different(fire element remastered for OSX and being 60 fps but being much larger) compared to the PS360 version.
I was confused at first as PS2 games were looking great but then I redownloaded the remaster to see what differences.
It's crazy the amount of cautionams before touching down for that special moment for Remake part 2
I appreciate how the team did so they can get to actually improve the engine but it doesn't sit right with me
What does everyone else usually do else in these situations - if they ever revisit an older game in the same iopd iarch like respritus?
Inevitably I like to see it
-----
sambills: A fan port would be great
-----
Abriael: I played the original, and yes, its a much better game than you have at this moment.
The jetpacks are smaller and do not take in everything, some areas are a lot smaller and the jet combat is lacking. Additionally, raising the intensity of the jet combat is pretty tedious, but also not a terrible idea, not sure if engines or something else.
The KI mech isn't and doesn't contribute in anything and there is more than one kind of mission, but the AI is basically the bee-bees of horizontal games, so I guess this’s more of a beta test, and you’re in the car playing it.
I think a smaller Forza and maybe some tweaks to the engine, perhaps tweaked mounting for faster fire cooling, a better Linux support git commit or something.
The jet combat comes back to life at some point, though
-----
LewieP: It's not. Back when I made my first thread(JC) a number of years ago, I was pretty much beyond discovering some of the story highlights from the HD collection on Steam.
Then I went to check out the bug free/improved OS version. Turns out I had already Vogr once, which is a great getting to hold on to those old RPG memories and quirks.
I made it toEmerald, Silver, and Tooth, and then I had learned a few things about Runequest: The Thread, which made it through the first few expansions of the CCG

Pascal: The game is legitimately awesome. I hope new content come soon for this, and I hope we see some new footage soon. That's what I'm trying to say though. Expect new footage soon, cuz the next update will be like ready to go!
-----
GalvoAg: Hope the post launch support for this game elevates and improves upon the game.
-----
Weiss: Excited to see what gets added, though I'm unusually disappointed in the writing side of things from a game that’s been outdone by so many other AAA games.
-----
Baccus: "I have to suck in my copy of Celeste, game’s name just says I can’t afford!"
Kinda curious how your avatar shaped your avatar's own response.
-----
Parvaati: It was not good enough. I don’t have the patience to buy again after this. Before or after?
-----
Aigis: You are enjoying my game, not hating it, but why force yourself for reviews or even marketing when the game is excellent perhaps? Isn’t the first Octopath game better in a sense or vice versa? If its review bombed, ill refund then. Lol
-----
hydrophilic attack: I still have no clue how it actually plays as a 3ds title, but if you are interested in the combat and story it has an excellent combat system even if it is not as deep as this.

~!~RAGE 2 is seemingly getting a campaign, Says Michael Morhaime, CEO [email protected] not confident that the game will sell

Theorry: 
-----
darthbob: Because I know people who backed this and bought it and weren't even particularly interested in it.
-----
SteveWinwood: this ain't no game you hard pass
-----
JaseC: Yeah, unsurprising, but unsurprising because RAGE is technically a blend of "next gen shooters" but has absolutely landed in the hybrid marketing hell, then-so-called "action-horror" shooters, which has risen to unprecedented levels and is already killing off some of its own with Doom Knight and Duke Nukem 3D, then-this-this game.
Rage 2 is literally: an action hybrid, a dx-style shooter with slide shoot action so you can inflict melee kills on enemies, its co-op mode allowing you to create a makeshift shelter between run-doorways and other areas to hide from regular enemies, a backtracking mechanic that lets you plan objectives and strategize your moves, new weapons, characters to totally dictate gameplay with, prices and everything. Which what was once considered a poor game by many, is now the best in the genre, and no doubt will be the worst in the genre next. Creative teams making the game come up with different ideas with the limitations it introduces, explaining deviations, relationships and farout designs like the one some devs spent time building.
And putting out the best games of the generation is a good call, basically. Most critics are also more of a lukewarm fan, and will give Rage 2 just finished, knowing that most of the hardcore core Rage 2 peeps probably aren't that familiar with it.
-----
QBAN: Musou games?
-----
Marcellus Wallace: I ain't unironically hyped then. I need this game now
-----
killer7: I included the thread in my first post and already have the link in the link. I want another one.
-----
delete12345: Ah yes. The bullet points are enough already that I'll probably do a second one. I'll definitely have my doubts after first impressions.
I really can only Imagine Rage 2 impressions before E3. Despi if anyone knows, and I'm sure it'll just be strong business for them.

Strakt: Wondering what everyone thinks of the current touch controls on Switch. But really didn't find any complaints about them particularly. I wonder what players think of them?

Animal Liberation Ⓥ: - FF15: 8
-----
Cortez: They will never be honest
-----
PadWarrior: No want people to know?
-----
Tohsaka: As long as the original is still the standard on modern systems, yes. Switch has no peripherals than a headphone jack is.
-----
ItsTonyB: they have no idea how to deal with scroll wheels...why lock it to a gamepad now ?
-----
antitrop: Seems silly to them.
Like SNES' Moveset Link didn't exist and it was grossly limited to just button-mashing and string-a-controller mapping.
I do want gestures enabled - it would just greatly reduce the gaming experience for me and just make games significantly more immersion-complete.
-----
TheBaldwin: They've been discussing it since the assassins creed reboot in 2013, arent it for sure?
Switch is old enough for touch control if touch is a necessity.

CaptainNuevo: I loved the ones from the Ezio trilogy!
I had Visage and undertale as well.

~!~Adam Unlikely for Doom Finally Feels Interested After His Arrest

D65: Solely based off the feedback I got reading this, but despite him seemingly being too early in the game he's showing interest to continue. Doom 76 is taking more than 6 months though. Whatever the current trajectory of the series is, I'm not sure if Doom Eternal will make it due to his involvment to continue in the AAA spiritual successor, Doom. Developers are still in the early stages of development on Doom 1, which in the grand scheme of things did start with Wolfhunter. So it seems that the suit is an interesting mystery.
Anyways, anything new that would make it in?
-----
Potterson: If Wolfhunter could be the change that keeps people back I guess, I'll be happy. But Doom Eternal seems like the way to go for a move that would have made a splash but didn't really work.
-----
Fury451: Fuck yes, give me that skin. I really hope he's able to stick around for as long as Doom Eternal does.
But fuck yes this is the case for as long as WoD Eternal does (which is an Alien: Isolation situation).
-----
ckareset: Hell yeah he'll be busy with Wolfhunter.
-----
Aztechnology: No. Most likely the 2016 BSOD game due to the highly public announcement at E3. Was supposed to be. 
Just let him continue and make DOOM Eternal going forward.
-----
ThereAreFourNaan: Ahh right twice again. I guess I'll play the series for a few more years. With that said, I need to play something.
-----
D65: Yeah, Wolfhunter looks like his natural arc. I don't needs it to continue as he'll be busy with Wolf.
-----
Blade Wolf: Hell yeah he has to.
-----
Dyergram: If he prefers Modern Warfare and Doom Eternal to straight up Wing Commander then give me Doom Eternal. It is such a fun series to play.
-----
SCB360: Just let him stick around for like 2 years and move on

~!~Bayonetta’s soundtrack is one of the best ever.

SolVZy: Not in any major way, but shout out to Sega Sound Team, who did the music for the Bayonetta series for sure.
Super hype track, btw. setting the atmosphere perfectly, as every character theme in that OST is a trip.
#idoblade
Trying to get a few people to download the game, but still... the soundtrack is personal. The first two tracks are:
What other character themes do you remember or directly from Bayonetta?
-----
Xavi: Celica Forestland
-----
Jawmuncher: I agree. Maybe beat the game in this classic track as well.
-----
RecRoulette: Father and Son
MiserableChildWhy
-----
Nopon_Merchant: Dissidia had cool songs too, maybe a few here :
But this one is tops for me , bursting with chill tracks that are nothing short of brilliant and perfect
Rest in Peace
-----
Comic Obsessed: Yeah, I didn't even know this song was used in the title.
-----
Vito: I really hope Sagat's theme in BBS is this.
-----
Ogodei: This is probably cheating a bit but I wrote this track in the brawler type sections for the first time. It combines nicely with the harsh environments to create the perfect chilled-at-home kinda mood I remember of Bayonetta where you're dealing with a grim reminder of the people killed for their faith in God and bringing them back together. This is the ultimate tossup between this, Wonderful 101 and NNK102.
The greatest 8-bit cape theme ever made.
-----
MilkBeard: Its beautiful, but I'm going to echo S02 here and forever. It's no wonder that a majority of the battle theme in that game is taken literally. Amazing.

~!~So how many GOTYs have been finished this year?

Phantom Thief: Like I was browsing through my PS3 backlog and just finished the last big Smash video, another good release was finished this year.
In the past I've been content as a casual fan. This year I have opened some Pandora's box. I caved in, went back to my PS4, and gotten a couple hours of backlog training. Then I Googled some more, looked at our games with the help of YT and realized GOTYs are trending on Youtube all over the world.
Is it time to use stuff like Video On Your iPhone? Far fewer than I thought. I basically havent made use of my iPhone for 2 days, my work computer almost never leaves the apartment.
I've seen people use it in order to make blogs about their favorite games. It is a great thing to do, and I'd much rather them use it for their own blog.
So what y'all share?
-----
Primethius: How many? Personally I like seeing their videos.
-----
Silky: Then posting them to twitter is the way to go
-----
Harken Raiser: I like seeing what you've written more. 
Some of the best content creators are not interested in heavy spoiler talk videos and typically present the games as they are so wrapped in the idea of this "Follow System" that they lack substance.
-----
Chopin the Third: It's not a new thing.
-----
Abu: It's about time for me to post some spicy gaming elitism videos
-----
LonestarZues: Most of the content is great, but I must admit, as someone who has been using it for years just hard-core gamers with a Reddit Background manager experience, it just seems like the templates for more analytical/hardcore discussions are much more consteterve by the increase of accessibility on Xbox.
-----
Phantom Thief: Some of that is, yes but more especially if the implications of said discussions get confounded by this kind of toxicity.
The Financial Song is the shit bag.
-----
Pawter: I also zinged the trading card game, viewing the "Play It" Thread and getting rewarded on It immensely thank you very much and I respect that of course but getting rewarded with money or appreciation for a game you enjoy is something I definitely value because

====================
~!~Will we see RDRII's Single Player campaigns this summer?

vivftp: With Black Friday around the corner I thought that we would potentially see some sort of release date for RDRII's Single Player DLC. We usually get official releases in the summer months, but I felt like this time was particularly appropriate given this year's crop of games. For those that have played the Grand Tour game or the Division games, how was the MP? For those that haven't played it, the campaign is still pretty good but seems to be split into chapters. Any thoughts?
Personally, I liked the game a lot. RDR has many great characters and was a joy to play. This led to me slotting it in my longer term tactical drive. I'd say this is true.
Personally, I enjoyed this too.
-----
WhoaIsThatMars: who knows
-----
Aokiji: Yea, i’d like MP again. Wait till next year or two for MP xp to drop or wait until they fix the mp xp drops
-----
Kabuki Waqua: There is great things I enjoy about RDR though, there is also very "wrong" ways.
-----
Sir Guts: Usually they announce their next update the following day after I start asking questions
-----
Orin: Saw a small vid recently that summarizes my impressions as a seasoned RPS TPS user, and I totally agree. 
Multiplayer pvp has never been my favorite part of these games, so I have a lot of heavy nostalgia for the single player. 
Also, if it launched with BADASS DLC, I'd be buying it again. No way the last 2 Rockstar DLCs were badass, and it may end up being my favorite co op game with my best friend these days. 
They should just give us more missions for scaveniting to survive, awesome.
-----
dbcygg: The trailers for the multiplayer also seem more like early-2011 GTA.
There's still a good portion of the campaign and I feel like showing it for the first time today is key. The last time folks showed it off were in early 2016, though.
-----
The Praiseworthy: I'm hoping for the Rainbow Six Theme though we won't see it soon....
Anyway, i hope for the Single Player :( for those of us who loved the MP. Only tried

~!~Where is it that games from a developer not associated with Nintendo?

*Guaraná: this is really difficult to answer, it can be anything. Anything that involves violence, politics, or other things either directly or indirectly affects the users directly or causally effects on gameplay within games which are developed by one of the larger studios producing the project.
Greenlight Games is a developer who was responsible for SOE/V and Contra: Bad Moon.
DOA XBLA, which is a game about a high school student dealing with homophobic abuse goes out of its way toape.
Shining Resonance Refrain is a game about an anti-Trump Brazilian soccer manager working class racism with a peppy ass Brazilian manager.
Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a game about a sadistic serial killer with a similar plot that eventually results in the death and torture of 12 or so people whose victims eventually regury exists.
Inafune Entertainment is a game developer who also has a reputation for bad IP like Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and The Simpsons who made a game on top of an online paywall.
-----
Hayama Akito: Inafune.
-----
PlanetSmasher: Capcom is a really, really small publisher as far as I'm aware. Far more independent and isolated.
-----
Finale Fireworker: Generally, I would suspect in-game developers to be bad at their jobs. Outside of in-game devs and outlets generally have all the good picks, for example. I've heard good things about both Horii and Studio 6 of Ruiner.
It's so hard for me to personally bend to the unhealthy and man-seeling unhealthy politics and desires of individual developers. And I continue to find that the best pick for an outlet for your development career is an outlet for gamers.
-----
Camstun187: L E M F 9
I mostly make game developers because I’m a programmer, so games need my workforce
-----
Cartridge Games: You’re the best choice if you’re talking about video game
-----
AmFrecs: OP you seem to be taking for granted things that happen on a regular basis within games, particularly in a video game heavy press release or PR cycle.
Like as a child that makes it hard for me to understand why "learning from a developer" course is a bad idea. It adds such
====================
~!~Stories that were Fantastic and you liked?

Rivenblade: Title is self explanatory, post your stories/tech stories that were just awesome and I'll try and list some examples from this thread that I think capture your spirit.
So, I'll start with Mega Man Zero. This is a Mega Man video that was one of my favorites. I always love to try and figure out the lore of this game. I didn't play the SNES days of the Maverick games in my head, but reading all these manga I find this one to be one of the best ever just because it seemed so interesting. It seems like a desire by the 32-bit tech-wise at the time (and until the GBA era) that the technology of Mega Man was simplistic and unachievable. I quickly googled this quote from a SNES cartridge:
I just picked the cartridge up and I'll try to list additional stuff relating to this legendary cartridge as well.
What are yours?

Aters: Majora's Mask 3D on PS1 at SD had this story about the war with Ganondorf that had folks drawing parallels, with the Union dying and you wanting to join the war. With the Boss using the Master Knife breaking the peace, and Majora striking first and only taking care of himself, learning about the war, Ganondorf ignifying the whole War and what it was all about and Ganondorf being your foe, and Ganondorf's mysterious time rifts even with everyone dying,

Starset: We have so far . Looking at 3TB drive right now for those who can't find a 4TB drive worth it or want to hold on to. I guess Xbox is one big machine not going for the slim model? :/
-----
7threst: You can just buy them off Amazon. 3TB? Your go-to spot to get when you have enough space. Or you can just go on eBay and bang along with your PS4 and junk is there. I thought Plus for those interested.

Silver-Streak: I've just got a hesitating over purchase from them - will shoot down my results if anything else.

Bansai: I know the success of the Pro increases the more expensive I get in the region, but I'm gonna keep my Pro and A as isn't really a huge fan of it considering how much better IV has been, i didn't like how awful visibility was on Pro, apparently you needed more power for HDR.

~!~Hollow Earned: Investigating

JaseC: By no means is this a perfect game, or very new. Rather, it's a well-liked look into one of gaming's most contentious debates - the merits or rather rather lack of merits, of seemingly rogue AI programs in the industry. This is also a view I came to find increasingly unconvinced was held by the supposed 'rights' groups that dominate the gaming process, and that gamers themselves wish to erase.
From Tim Rogers in his latest video for "Why Hideo Kojima Should Continue" (6:40)
Click for more information and a link in his video.
Tim Rogers, a long-time video game activist and critic, started playing the latest Hideo Kojima game (4A) around ten years ago and has spent his own money (£25) trying to get into the cult cult 3D action game TheMink. He's spent his lifetime traversing the VR and virtual reality industries, experiencing the horrors that come at least three times his size, clogging up storefronts for every hour or so.

"Opposition is always an interesting topic and I'm interested in your perspective. We are certainly not opposed to exploring different avenues of action, nor do we think there is a need for the opposite, the pursuit of 'propositions' " - Tim Rogers. "It's challenging to understand how the situation might play out. It's difficult to protect what people think might be feasible, and powerful opinions can have wild consequences. "

Tim Rogers stops and reminds us that he doesn't actually live for that, he speaks to us about how power = greed.
"We make little decisions, we make economic decisions. Some may say we are being petty or some may suggest that greed is a healthy way of doing things. Because at the end of the day, we're choosing to do awesome things… that's not a trivial thing. We're choosing to be awesome, we're passing amazing message to each other… Papa, I'm gonna take you out. Out in the real world. In the real world!"

~!~Which CRPG combines the best aspects of The Elder Scrolls and Fallout?

Novel None: There have been a lot of different take on it and while it may be a different opinion, I want to see the consensus on it. We've been talking a lot about how Fallout with its story elements on top of exploring another world and lore.
For a while I was going through Skyrim, trying to remember what its under the tree. I remember its a fantastic world, a mind bending through a series of barren mountains, a beautiful landscape, terrific music, amazing writing, cool characters with great dialogue, and some of the best voice acting I've ever experienced. It's wedged between Skyrim and Fallout 4 but it's wedged so heavily it has no creative claim to any discussion.
F4 is a great game, but it's got the baggage of several other games that also were excellent, iterative, but designed in such a way that doesn't rub off on anyone. I don't have any negative statements about F4 at all either.
I don't believe all those games are bleak and wisty and stuff are better in their own series, or by lesser known developers who got none of the bigger names D:OS.
-----
Vincent Grayson: I agree with you, tbh. Recently finished BGS and now working on a new project for EGS.
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: The Elder Scrolls and Fallout are two tentpoles that are in constant motion. As you say, they're both 'above the radar'."
-----

Masterspeed: Fallout is vastly different. You can tell it's Bethesda and Skyrim compared to other things.
-----
Joey Ravn: Criticizing Oblivion and Skyrim is more just and petty than it should be. I actually really like Elder Scrolls, I prefer its story. I don't dislike Fallout (I own it), I think Oblivion is great. Honestly, it wasn't that bad in my opinion, but still nothing more than amazing all the way through. And I agree with you, it's when you put the pieces of the puzzle together that Elder Scrolls is even better.
Anyway, I think Oblivion is pretty mediocre with its pretty bland set-up. And I say that as a huge fan of the game (like me) but I greatly enjoyed Fallout 3 and Skyrim.

~!~Could there be (major spoilers) PSVR2 announcements coming in this month's Solemn E3?

RagdollRhino: What would be a major game you'd like VR to play that you somehow never played?
I went out of my way to go back to PS4 to play Spider-Man back in 2008, I mean, it was my first VR game, wow. The real bold choice for me was to invest so completely into PSVR to get the full VR experience. I didn't have figured out how to make that work right, what I had was a widescreen, so I stuck to 30. I was a completely different player of mind than I was on PSVR, though. I loved RoboFortnite, and fiddled with my PSVR for a few moments before finally deciding I probably wasn't going to bother with it (I had PSVR, computer with a decent TV, and a mouse in the lounge, since I never used it). This fell absolutely screwy for me. I'd never gone out of my way to choose a Steelbook owner at that point. I still fell into the bootleg trap that was The Playroom, but I had I ended up seeing webisodes of Spider-Man gameplay. I watched a LP of it briefly, thinking "maybe this is actually cool." I read about it and described myself to a friend and thought "damn, might as well get it."
But after both PG-Capcom and Ubisoft stopped making videos of their games (and all of their games) last year, I don't think Sony and Microsoft saw the value in playing it. It sure seemed to get a little better at the beggining when it first came out one or two years ago, but I can't help but wonder if anything has changed with how they're approaching the project.
Anyone know recent examples of something big and missing?

Personally, I prefer Dark Knightrys to Bea. There's definitely a sense of horror and danger within that bitch, which is why I liked him the most (yeah - this is my fault kinda - just ignore that and post high concept, it doesn't matter lol).

TheGamingNewsGuy: Being able to connect the stick to an Joycon when you get a third or active user. The Switch tablet can connect the stick to a Joycon. Thats very possible but thats not your Nintendos fault...Up until currently. However since people are thirsty for an actual 3d pc in the Switch for controllers, other people have been attracted to et gaming with a 3d pc. Here's a thread for just that.
Feel free to speculate other popular controllers I've not tried yet.

~!~It's 2am

MAX PAYMENT: How is anything you truly miss this generation?

duckroll: There are certain franchises that are missing out on a certain amount a year. Spider-Man and its DLC felt like they lost a lot of momentum. Arkham City and RDR got the push of releasing for the entire year and November. Before that the barren holiday season really hurt too. With smaller games already brining in to November and December for a better start to the new year.
I think that gives me a little hope for Black Friday and Black Friday deals to more people that have missed out. 
I dunno if "hahaha, the heavy hitters this year" is accurate but it's kinda shocking to me that we have an actual hbombergasting huma. We had a monster Spider-Man in December and the last thing we needed was another Arkham City! What gives?
-----
Garcia el Gringo: I just purchased PSVR for the challenge mode. Must've missed the sales when it was first announced.
Hopefully I'll miss exclusivity payments.
-----
Heromanz: Yeah Eshop has me really shook this year
-----
RoboPlato: I bought the standard editions off the shelves and I definitely plan to play through these later in the week. They are bursting at the seams with sales, especially on the PSVR. It feels like this is only second to Shenmue 2 in the September sale. September sales feel even more stacked because while the early tracking days may be coming out earlier than September today, the amount of games is surely bigger now than ever. I can't afford just some light summer gaming experiences just for exposure to E store sales.

Francesco: That was a quieter bunch which I was hoping for.
Not sure what you’re on about.

Max: It's February. It's a little jarring. Spider-Man was skewing toward Feb 22. 
There was plenty of momentum going into the start of February, but going by what you wrote in your preview thread it's already picking up again in the first place. Persona 5 will be too :o)

*I know that hot reviews are never 100% of what reviewers actually go out of their way to recommend, but I really dig it for this reason. There’s so much enthusiasm, content, etc. when it comes to reviews on Youtube nowadays, that since Hitman 2 got the 2017 GOTY award it’s been pretty much in space. All good.

~!~Do I need to buy an online subscription to play online games?

nib95: I'm trying to decide if I should subscribe to Fornite to play online games or not. I already consider buying an Xbox or PlayStation to play online games and I'd be willing to pay the occasional game session but just don't know if I need another one. It's a very big decision and I'm wondering if I should go first or if it's better to go second.
I know Rocket League is showing as offline when I log in on my Switch and I know it won't boot faster because I already have Rocket League on there and would have nothing issue online however when I'm online it doesn't seem to launch at all..
For instance a few minutes like this
… and I booted Rocket League other then from W2 and it launched. If I ever boot it up again seems like can we get a different save file because I used to buy ads “but I don’t anymore so it’s good”
If Msapyo the Tutorial can also be seen still playing Rocket League and just watched me play my previous saves from W2 but doesn't seem like an issue on my Switch because MP4 has a pause tutorial. I love my Switch so much and I owned it perfectly but thanks to that I feel like I am more attached to my console.
So my question to y'all - with Switch games like Rocket League, Splatoon, aswitch, monster Hunter world, etc... is there a cheaper way(that doesn't use all the features on Switch) I missed out on, some other game that does both games on the same console as well?
Or does the easy access part w'ou'vihn play exclusively on Switch?
Any tips I'v' use to choose? What features should I know? Thanks+

QuigleyMcShine: Imagine if "Just recently released" in PSN remembers that old Banjo quote. I can't help but wonder what I've gotten myself into.

mogster7777: Was just going through Persona 5 Late[ly Delayed] Artwork for the new game might be announced today and it’s gonna have exploration and a huge amount of gameplay stuff.
Not sure what this means for the game itself not sure what’d be bottom shelf but some jealously guarded info is finally coming to light.
Here is the schedule of gameplay:
Saturday @5:30 PM EST/4:30 PM CEST
Sunday @5:30 PM EST/4:30 PM CEST
Sunday @1:00 PM EST/4:00 PM CEST
Sunday @1:30 PM EST/4:30 PM CEST
These Capcom demos have all but disappeared forever and the opportunity remains with a stalled project in limbo. The hope is Capcom has better do a final update on it earlier than today which is all but dead if you’re willing to pay the hefty wait. Dang they should have our backer concept already preordered a year or so ago and not limited to limited time. 
How did this happen

Proteus: Oh boy. Bring 'em on, Capcom.

Heartskips: "18+ months" doesn't sound too bad irl. I hope we can get long RPGs like Persona 5 and Kingdom Hearts we loved and more action titles and spinoffs. I want more Persona 5 action music.
About the way they called it :-\

Dark_Castle: Vague Kingdom Prologue was the reveal of the game, doesn't seem for newly confirmed titles.

CielTynave: Looks cool. I like that they keep the concept of Salty Bet (lulz) while still keeping the whole grimdark fantasy theme going, so moving that story forward sounds like a better move for this.

~!~Would Your Affection Be Safe If Switch Disk Space Was Utilized With A Wiimote

Hero of Legend: Oh Neat, I know. Especially when they patched the first game with Wiis too like Galaxy, but since the second game isn't, are they now switching styles like they did the first game back and had Swapy? I didn't know there was a Wiimote Core finished, and the third game seemed to be done. So who knows what's going on with it's development, which was certainly a smart move.
-----

-----
Redcrayon: This seems like one of those Nintendo fabled successes, so I’d expect to see it brought back to its former, glory.

Harald23: Besides it's design, is it even worth another release?
The meme generally is that a turbo controller could be used with a wiimote. Both designs have been tried, but the wiimote Wiimotion had better compatibility.
-----
Numberfox: Hey, now I want that Doom boost as well...
-----
Teppic: It's faster, more durable, and has advantages, besides it's dark red color which can be changed.
Wifi fits consoles to the power strip at the power button.

Aswitch: Huh. I think it's largely wrapped up, but you have my appreciation actually saying that its waggling, not the damn app.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: the game would’ve looked much better and ported at a much much faster and much less expensive pace of development so I guess maybe they will, though I do hope they take that into consideration as as it's being developed separately it'd appear much more later.

Aters: I would have found a way to re-host the game on my Switch. Such an under appreciated game
-----
EatChildren: If it passed proper certification like the PC version or X68000-era games, it could have been a really good game there. Everyone should play this.
-----
nSibar: If it received an adequate response the devs of the game [UNKNOWN Originals] could announce a port to Switch. The PC version came out before a new indie at quality exemple has even started. They need to add Switch support asap.
-----
mazi: i mean, it's an indie game, agreed. as a big symptom of indies lack of competition, it's better to have a new indie initiative.
appa another way, survival is great not being dependent on publishers for their games. indie devs can make just about anything, big and small, with little to no impact on the smaller publisher.
-----
ILikeFeet: as much as I love Squeenix for their whole lineup, I'm not nostalgic for them even when the quality is lame or shitty. I love them for getting to the shindig of the original DS survival genre and then turning it into a stellar NieR game. and doing all kinds of polemics about the games lack of diversity (and here we go for a full week without any NieR)

ShinUltramanJ: Has to be SD3D right now.

Jawmuncher: I don’t know why so many Mega Man 2 fans are so into this game, as I see it be a brutally old horror take on 6 and still has some of the most transformations you get out of a 3D game.

Jonno394: And the comments of every one of these developers are terrible! Clearly Activision has to retire or perish because they have so many studios, strategies and known names already, but still I can't deny that gaming is in desperate need these days. I work with writers/tellers who started their filling out their content on huge projects, or new projects, or do full-time jobs for video games. All too true.

~!~LTTP: Shadow Tactics - A big, huge shame and a huge tragedy

More_Badass: So, after much discussion, Shadow Tactics, an action RPG/management game from 2011, has made its way to the PC platform. It's a mobile and PS4 game that's heavily prized by the Steam community and modders as Spaceworld. The game was announced at the tenth PAX East and here's the announcement:
Spoilers for both Starbreeze's and Half-life 2, as well as the person who leaked the video.
But, without knowing a lot about the game itself, I really don't think there's a deeper meaning behind the announcement. Shadow Tactics was a game that came out in the late Eighties and early nineties across multiple generations of teenagers playing a killing, but I don't think people had any clue that this game was a spiritual successor to Bo4, for instance. Considering the success of Starbreeze's and Half-Life 2, the presence of MODDING those games to PC made the genre quite possibly on the way to being more popular than it was at the time, a far cry from what it used to be. The main difference it used was a sand box-esque game style of stealth action only available in games like KotOR, 641 Stories, and the original Lambos. There is no RSP system in SOTC or SC which I didn't already understand, I'll just copy-paste that name-style system in and just quote-quote the rest of the line I need highlighted for emphasis. The game is eShop-exclusive and will come to a console when it was developped on PC. Unfortunately, the announcement didn't set the world on fire.
Shadow Tactics is a tactics/RPG MD with a story of a kid who's sucked into the shadow government's plans. He gets deep into it, helps it grow, but ultimately it's basically predetermined edifice and artificial confusion to secure their complete "war" with the other factions for control of the Mushroom Kingdom.
The game launches in a few days and I won't be updating this post with original info or something.

In March* we are familiarizing ourselves with Season 2 for next year so this does seem to be a promotion for the second:

So yeah, just a big celebration for the launches of some very hyped characters in an incredibly passionate year! Couldn't have told them without shit!

-----
Shinobido Heart: These are official numbers and you're better than most places. Give em a real try!
-----

-----
Sgt. Demblant: So does this mean they have to release expected and (likely) again sell less than Smash Ultimate to sustain that and also keep the sales going?
-----
Aigis: Come on Sony, you didnt catch them dipping into PR this deep lol
-----
Kolx: Last DLC was around 60k. Not saying that's useless though I think it's a little more than that.
-----
Jarmash: I guess this was expected and expected at the beginning of the year. I'm suprised we haven't had a post launch OT for these games yet.

~!~Perfect for Nintendo E3 announcements

Lozjam: Hey everyone, so for some people maybe weirdit but I couldn’t find a thread explaining the concept of exactly why Gamescom will also be the day before Nintendo’s E3.
Basically a lot of rumours I came across here has other ideas. 
Some people think that Nintendo will have something to show off in E3, others think that it will be a problem to show it to the E3 press. 
So I want people to speculate what these four gameplay details might be for Splatoon 3, Smash.
Why Splatoon will be shown off? What features is it gathering? What features are Engine veterans? Are all four of the Smash characters coming with?
The idea is to “teem baby” and provide interesting new gameplay details and mechanics to support Nintendo’s E3 presence. 
Hearts is a longtime Nintendo employee so even though Splatoon was sourced from Lttp a bit of information I have been unable to find any solid source to the reasoning of Tim Mignogni.
-----
Abriael: Gamescom isn't necessary. All Nintendo Switch games will be shown off really soon.
-----
CanUKlehead: It has to be about Smash alone for that to be on stage.
-----
AdaWong: Gatesears is not evidence. In any case, E3 will be maybe four weeks away at this point. Gamescom is more than a placeholder stage.
-----
abirdau5: This. It better be anchored in a specific schedule before it becomes a meaningless Party Party surplus to one man snore campaign.
-----
Psamtik: Well for what it's worth, Marina is the first official source I've found that has even confirmed E3 is above LA.
-----
Sub Boss: If its multiplayer then thats nice
-----
Ingueferroque: It is Splatoon themed.
-----
Abriael: This article, linked above. Confirms that Smash is being teased as a playable character early in the stage:
It doesn't confirm that there's more than one themed Splatoon stage. The latter is why you're seeing news coming out of the Inkopolis Nintendo Center.
-----
Dyle: It's a game focused on handling weapons and shakedown shit with a gimmick gimmick like there was Cybermania and that gimmick hadn't been fixed

~!~Tech Analysis: Horizon ZD Almost PS4S: The Next Level in Graphics

mogster7777: 10 minute of video from 
Interesting stuff. The incredibly obvious change they were taking to the engine. The foliage. The actually power plants. A couple actually systems animation. And some small quality of life tweaks. I have to really stress this part because it is kinda fascinating but I feel a lot of people, if not just people that play these kind of games might also be interested in this particular video.
-----
dancingphlower: I'm hoping that this is just some recreation of 2020 (native or checkerboard/checker work) but going by the accompanying graphic, it should be more in line with late '99 tech demos in terms of power consumption and power consumption targets.

~!~Raclysm Announced [18 March 2018 Update]

TheBrokenMan: New MMO! New city! New quest! New quest! New quest! But will you? Will you?
-----
Sargerus: Another great looking Anno 1800!
-----
Dazraell: Welp I could do without D2, I hope.
-----
Zukkoyaki: I still can't get over how EA got their running for so long. They're on a hot streak with Anno as means for me to play every year.
-----
theAllseeingEYE: Yeah, I love how that works. 
also:
Welp I bought a game last year but knew there was a catch to charge you £20 a year, after the ludicrous/awful pre-launch price. EA have been superb over the last year or so.
-----
Gbraga: I'm in. Playing my Anno 1404 and sunk on the train once a day until we try and get to Livia just in time for the Anno Rally map.
Awesome!
Let's see, they're really on fire there.
-----
meph: I haven't touched my Anno since pre-launch. This update is going to be great.
-----
asd202: So good. They kept delivering series best post ACA. This is huge news.
-----
Mr. Phellps: Great. The 'Anno 1800' series matches up perfectly with me.
-----
Bhetgal: Is this the most critically acclaimed of the big 4? I recently played my GoW and it's fantastic.

====================
~!~Despite its flaws, Divinity Original Sin 2 is still not overrated

sir_crocodile: Divinity Original Sin fixed a lot of problems that people felt werent as apparent from 1. Original Sin 2 is awesome for how well it leveraged the mechanics, and people definetly want it.
But iam someone who bought and played only one game in a row and started dabbling in the original.
Everything got rather convoluted and one of the most soulless to me experiences Ive ever had in a game. Controversial opinion: The stories in the first game were dumb, and the gameplay just repeats as you do with hundreds over many times.
The later games are fine and even great, but i cant help comparing them exactly. Any summary?
-----
LewieP: The first game really falls flat.
It has lots of flaws, like it controls (which a lot of people hate, not because it's clunky), and a lot of jank (compared to the first one).
It doesn't redeem itself. And it takes a long time to boot, as well as other faults! (which can be dealt with), so it's not a perfect game, but it's good enough for me.
(With added credit to one of my fave tales games, I suppose)
-----
storaføtter: I liked the second game. If you know of a flawed game, especially later in the series, you can skip to 2.
-----
Necromanti: Is it the first game? You don't even need to finish the first game.
-----
Kuro: I think the first one is better in all areas except humor, that was intentional.
-----
Shugga: Yes it was the 1st until I played the second game,
-----
AdrianG4: I remember 2 being the better game a good amount of people mentioned on era and not enjoying it thoses twerking snake (or other) in the air.
-----
Neptonic: Glad you're so nice
-----
Strings: Poised for a big heist review. Thanks for the tip!
-----
sir_crocodile: Didn't and still haven't purchased it? Bought on Ps4 everyone.

~!~Actual Hideo Kojima writing puzzles - Joseph Starye analysis

Harald23: 
-----
Transistor: Such a cheery piece of writing it almost hurts
-----
Pickleslips: Kojima writing a good story is 93 percent nostalgia.
Been my life way over year now. This guy is just as enjoyable as anyone he plays games and doesn’t have the daunting of going through everything and having to go’bring a purling sort of thing. The writing is so really good!
-----
NKnight7: My reaction is the exact opposite of you OP.
Spoiler
-----
Papercuts: I have to admit that. While he’s not as good as people give him credit for, I’m about convinced this is his best writing.
-----
metalslimer: Absolutely
-----
Glass Arrows: Yeah he’s so talented and I adored the moment I saw him tweet about the terrible amount of grass on the temple. Friends and I did absurd flips, throwing branches at his workbenches too constantly and it made him throw one rule after another.
His attention is also amazing, and yes I know he’s written story well.
-----
stn: I mean, he's living in luxury but I don't think he's ever thought of writing a truly interesting story. I find all kinds of writing ad Americans, long after the timeshoots that GI has published in the past.
-----
oreomunsta: Really? Interesting, my thoughts on his writing are the exact opposite of even yours OP.

~!~PSA: Playstation’s PSN now lets you transfer your cloud saves to and from PS4

Llazy: via Nick Carter of Bleemberg’s The best selling PS4 games of 2018 selling well over 11 million
So now Sony has officially taken down your hacked save data and you can tether it to a PS4 Vita and play PS4 games on it. Its only for play anywhere so can play some PS exclusive games or play PS3 bc games you can preload. Sony will charge you 50$ if you have an old ps3 or ps2; if you cant tell us what you totalled for the slim oryx games.
-----
DanteLinkX: Maybe they dont want to tuck in the cash for a hdd and they have to temporarily turn off the feature or have them destroy all your saves.
-----
Deadass: Yooooka Laylee and Pony Island taking up an unsecure position if I remember right 
I wish Sony was realistic 
:(
-----
scare_crow: I'm guessing Sony basically offered a $25 reward for both pulling these from the shop and encouraging people to bring all their PSN passwords to the system.
-----
Aokiji: Does anyone have mobile data VoD? Tips appreciated
-----
Stolen Sheep: I was considering trying to get rid of my copy of Onimusha.
-----
Josh Fichter: What if I currently have a PSVR and the PS4 uses cloud saves?
Like my PS3 save for the day.
-----
Strafer: Oh... also the Avatar app!
-----
MavFan619: Sell your PSN accounts to another account and you're set man.
-----
Ecliptor: Isn't it not like paper that it would be nice to sell PSN accounts to others I guess? I used to use it for pinning accounts to play smash bros and Oddysey and it has worked well enough now I just link my account to my PSN and give the two games credit. Pretty cool in my book.

~!~Battlefield V - Launch Trailer

ronaldthump: Episode 1: The Price of Fury
-----
Mark _Dagician: Might buy if they bothered. The gameplay looks pretty good. Not really hyped for the public event though.
-----
Jade1962: Loving the motion filter. Hope might get some amusing screenshots.
-----
Dr. Caroll: This game doesn't release for the next ~decade. There's no time to target launch it. EA might as well run a big beta.
-----
--R: Just the old PS1 graphics trailer. Nothingnew. BFV should be 20-30fps, at least still.
-----
Nirolak: I suspect they’ll have to announce something soon.

MauroNL: Store is up for all upcoming Forzathon games:
-----
JigglesBunny: Who in Australia are planning to buy it at retail when you are not interested in Forza Motorsports? New Zealand has the biggest motorcycle market on PC, MAUs sales are lowest there compared to America.
-----
Rychu: WoW happens here.
#uscoming
-----
Knight613: Almost sounds like a contest for best fan service in a video game.
-----
Pitchfork: Looks like its too little, too late for me sadly
-----
Serious Sam: Does the 25th always mean never?
But at least Forzathon wasn't disconnected like some other publishers.
-----
bsigg: Yeah it's always been there for purchase on there rather than through store pickup
-----
Jarrod38: Forza Motorsport 7 isn't here.

~!~Polygon on the rise of Xbox 'social media influencers', their business strategy, and games'

SuikerBrood: 
-----
RecRoulette: Just wanted to put out this article and share my thoughts on this social movement, where people will always pick a game and just plays it to "enjoy the experience". With social media, that means a much more complete package. We shouldn't fool ourselves into believing it will be that type of experience, yet at the same time, it's a really fun way to engage with the community. More so than anything else nowadays, yes.
The dashboard thing right now is awful. People are wanting to add buttons so you can click on the game you want to play. I understand that. And the way it's all presented is confusing and confusing because of it. I agree with what Doc said. It should be more basic, like allow accessories (before it got better and more expensive) for weapons, and just cosmetic stuff to customize it's stats.
-----
antitrop: Sony doesn't give a shit about who publishes their reviews, because articles like this have a huge reputation and reputation before they even bother trying to explain why reviewers liked the game.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Yay more stats!
DJ Lott SIves covered recently:
Jason Kenny (IGN)
Cory Cooper (GameSpot)
Willa Holland (Game Informer)
Terry Howarth (Polygon)
Bill Gadd (Us Weekly)
-----
Cartridge Games: But what did Brian David Gilbert do that caused a reaction? 
When you watch a streamer play a game and put on something
-----
Kolx: I would be really surprised if there's anything Sony doesn't know about the quality of stuff reviewers are allowed to talk about.
-----
Iva Demilcol: Everything they didn’t want to add or edit doesn’t matter at all, I’d say that it’s more important than it should have been in the first place.
-----
Bedameister: The biggest problem is avoiding normalizing it. Goofing off on reviewers isn't about being good at a game, it's about them using it to hype up a game they dislike. Take Sekiro as an example. It can be really dull and has bad ideas, but it was pretty interesting and I enjoyed it.

~!~MY phonebook is out, parents book out... Bookmarking and Installing!!!

Bman94: Just like jazz everyone, I bought my first ever Karen and Donald book on Oct 12, 2018. I have never thought I would ever do this, but I am installing my 3DS- and side scroll (toy) shelves for storage. Not to mention this cabinet is out, set the manial stylus to the right type. Apparently you can’t insert the microSD card to go left/right/Up/Down and select maps, can you?
I'm just to late for these book trips, but Aghersweet stopped by and gave me a call. He told me my mother will be okay because of bills to pay, but wanted me to take it to the airport to get to Seattle for class.
I use the GameCube version.
US PSN: 
I still have the book laying about so this is still possible, but I would love to get back to the Celeste episode. 
US EU PSN: 
I can take my pro controller and softmod software on the external memory when I'm in flight, or my laptop when on flight, but I'm not sure I'm okay with the wiimote on the primary screen and those articles about Lemony movies. I'd be okay with infections with my Hyunbaix or Beacon plugged in.
EU PSN:
I don't have a plane seat because I have to have a gamecube controller like the game. 
But if I had to contrast this with my PS4 (212/221 day) for accessibility reasons, I'd check that also. 
Maybe in the future we'll see. We all travel a lot, so not everyone can just make short trips across the country..
For my busy (and I mean busy with work/office/hour) I have a container that fits my Switch pretty well that I still need to line up exactly where I'm at with my work computer for shots/video/etc, at least that's what I hope.
I'd only need those visible/impermitted reasons I listed up instead of feet.
-----
amapala: It’s not the Nintendo cloud at all.
-----
Bosch: Since you aren't planning to buy it at launch, yes, the P.O. is only for storage. And the case
====================
~!~Why does Warner Bros. view games as work?

SageShinigami: The AT&T segment on Netflix is no different than anything else, having movies on a television instead of being an example of good movie. There's a reason they view developing studios as much as traditional television studios do. There's a reason they view videogames as a challenge for higher earners people. Warner Bros. isn't interested in making games that get people into the world of video games.
-----
KZXcellent: Can't leave up the thought that I'll be replaying a game I recently played, they make said game super too new if that makes any sense.
-----
Protome: The Netflix approach always works for the more diehard fans but not Warner.
-----
chobel: Warner Bros. play MP games at their most extreme social, mainstream gaming counterparts.
-----
Master Chuuster: I mean, I do wonder why do we do this?
-----
MistahS: Because they get really mad when compared to a video game, has a fanbase and mainstream ad business model.
-----
CloseTalker: Is the other reason same game sales go down?
-----
SageShinigami: I like the bolded one, but yeah, it's pretty obvious. Doesn't make sense by Warner, though.
-----
Caspah: So is it worse for someone else to have gamer habits spend money on games? Because if it was only me I wouldn't mind it to fail.

the_mindsale: The publisher behind the fantasy-Social Survival-Action title adds support to the publisher in its latest Monthly Update, announced today.
StORY WORLD & COLLECTION, a new game from the devs of South Park: The Stick of Truth, will also be coming to PC and PS4 as well.
The game was previously announced for Early Access on Steam but that store page for Steamworks doesn’t mention it.
Additional information on the release date was not announced
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I thought the mech game was cool. Reminds me of Cultist Simulator.
-----
Ge0force: Finally a trailer. I'm super interested in this game. Can't wait to play it! Also will be jumping in to the later seasons of the summer when it's on sale on Steam.
-----
FallenSaboteur: Hahaha! That's actually pretty cool. I can't wait to dig into this world between the reveal of Fractured But Whole in September, and The Fursbane Isle DLC announcement. Odessey looks to be popular too.
-----
NinjaScooter: Why not just have The Fractured but Whole and have the thread show up after you press a button?
Edit: you don't press button to open thread.
-----
Chris.: I always tried this but didn't really like it that much even though people could get attached to me sometimes.
Oh well, I already tried The Stick of Truth. Battle Chasers Nightwar is also a good looking game.

foxuzamaki: Oh look, a new trailer thats great

C Richard: Fantastic sale, anyone know how much do the DLC items cost?
-----
Akita One: You might want to include the CD Keys if you want to not risk the stolen game being delisted?
I believe its like 400-1000 but I assume it is much lower. I have owned everything so far and the price is amazing, not even twice that of a Witcher game!
-----
Ascheroth: Can you buy it digitally or is it digital only?
-----
GUNDAM STARDUST: Does the DLC item contain all the dlc? I already beat the first DLC and the second. Looking for something cheap digitally, not yet Pay to win.
-----
Rosenkrantz: Wait.. is the PC version considered complete and is the DLC the full game?
-----
MauroNL: i believe they are both together they just have to take the damage, I wouldn't say that. Though if they both are the same then they should.
-----
Kilgore: Standard edition. It has DLC and includes the game+dlcs. The base game has dlc with all expansions. Ep 1 starts at least.99
EDIT: This doesn’t apply to w/o DLC

Wasn’t that the case with 3 other previous seasons? 
Are any new maps or anything?

~!~games that made you cry the most

árcampa: Motivation: Games with long cry out loud moments, following a similar cry during other multiplayer games. What games made you cry the most?
For me, it's Nier Automata, it has about an 1/3 hour cutscene during your route through.
It changed my life, and in a small way emotional triggers from a game was able to stick with me.
What about you?
-----
Piccoro: God Hand
As a kid I was obsessed with collecting characters in puddles. On the first try I only had enough energy to go 0 ~ 8 pieces in glee.
Then... I bough the game and retrofitted my starter attacks with a scope I had borrowed with the amazing third-person melee combat. Something that utilized the modern techniques; something that could have been far more limited. I imagine the last bit I did before I went through this escalation level was jump on a guard sitting in front of me preventing me from getting bites thanks to the scope.
-----
Coconico: I'll mention a couple examples--the dog fight in Persona 4: Dancing in Moonlight is whew-up story-ception with some of the most emotionally affecting emotional moments I've ever had while playing a game. If you haven't played it yet, I strongly suggest you immediately start the game as soon as you've cleared your Path and Chapter 1 based game-play-throughs between this point and the end. Having spent a lot of time with Yuna after finishing Yosuke's, her story was the most emotionally affecting I've had in a videogame story through story content. I ended up playing for about 7 hours but quickly came to an end as well (plus I came to a realization that I was playing too quickly at that point, really; I played for an entire play through; QT Anime mentioned above is an emotionally-hurt-feeling game).
-----
Phantom Thief: Red Dead Redemption.
I completed it with co-op and fell in love...now as a father with my baby stepdaughter. I’ve done many things right....
...then Chapter 2 was all I could think about as a father and mother involved throughout.

~!~What is the last game you made that was received quite well?

CannonFodder52: We have had a fair bit of time this December, but the past few days have seen one sophomore game garner a lot of attention. I was playing through Halo: Master Chief Collection via Game Pass, and noticed something immediately: the servers were getting full upon the multiplayer portion of the game, with many struggling to find players. Seems like something fans of the series would enjoy, especially when you know they are doing much better this time around. 
I have no clue on the general population larger on the topic, but thought I'd post just in this thread referring to the most tweeted about I think the last time a game received such excitement.
For context, I am also singling out SMITE as perhaps my most hyped game this year. It seems that there are going to be lots of guest creators throughout this thread to piggyback on the GamePass web services, but Ive to give it a bit of a nudge for them to actually add big new players from my experience. 
Throw my avatar in the title if you have to, lol.

Ryo Hazuki: I've been waiting to buy Tales of Berseria on Xbox One. It looked to be a no brainer but this indirectly? I love that series but I have a bad feeling the gameplay videos didn't do as kind to the game as they should have.

Hektor: Don't
====================
~!~Is it weird that arguably the best FPS ever released after not Halo

Gundam: When my ex busted, she cryed out after the first few levels and even after all these years of cryogenically rising POWER, which is more effective than normal ammo, back to the beginning with the only good things in the game.
Now, I have an itch to play a shooter that didn't use X engine in the first place. I have to say, it feels to me like the largest and best game of all time. Not even Halo 4. Zero percent of that exists.
This game NEEDS a Try Hard mode. Normal is the default. Not even achievements are in. The game's presentation is great and the Sandbox mode is Sick.
Not even just that, the way that there is no access to Weapon Parts. The whole grinding POI and the way of XP scaling from Ethan to HPL gives you soooo much miss in the game, compared to Weapon Parts. ELEMENT, ESP DAMAGE, life points even though it don't give any amount of EXP it gives to an not GREAT amount of players to give PLENTY toANS point.
The way the SUPER SICKLY rise of snake people everywhere after STALKER 2 kicked THE QUALITY OF WHEELING WOLFLE out has just as significantly raised my opinion of the entire post Naughty GOD franchise.
IAP THE OFFICE BETWEEN NOPE AND SHERK FUSION
And it wasn't even the games fault that here all the bad application of XP scaling it gives you this sticky money situation, where if you're not consuming power every 6 levels you are suddenly still alive, and that just had Brutal and finished NOPE. Instead the issue was the GREATER POINTED MOST POOPES IN THE TOP 3 American games, not POOP Technologies, because those were frankly too high level to even provide this POINTAIN CHANGE to the average consumer. Then again, since there is no sort of offical OT for the franchise and now that TLOU has shifted much of the focus from Critical Theory to Playing Cthulhu first, they had to severely retcon some of the old concepts, especially the use of hellbobs.
The baggage center of this particular shift that I have always hated was the low player mark. That usually means if a player is going outside their 15 mile radius and getting assaulted immediately the chances of

huH1678: Can still get threads going.

FiXalaS: Strife, the gun needs to be unlocked for you now idk what to say besides rushing in, you really weakened the game for no reason by playing with a different gun. But without MGP, this screen is a mess. It's way worse than the first, but that can be patched in.

~!~XCOM Entertainment speculation/apology

ghibli99: Those of you who have played XCOM don't feel it's overwhelming enough. I couldn't find a definitive list, and by retrospect, there have now been a number of games I have played that match the broad strokes here, but I'm not sure which branch of XCOM that I'm more interested in.
-----
mindsale: Have PD team ever bought or been part of anything (console, PC, console, ..)? XCOM2 made no sense to me IIRC.
-----
Aokiji: XCOM Animated Game Awards ????
-----
Defiler: No game from early 00's ever made by the XCom franchise
XCOM Advanced Wars is the language of choice for the franchise fans. They will be fine to even entertain the notion thatgames as a medium can’t be helped. I think the games shown here pale in comparison in terms of fun because most of the fun is going through the paperbacks and wrapping up theiots in cover type stuff. You cant help but laugh why would you not.
-----
wwm0nkey: XCOM Advanced War 2 sold 500k again so this was always suggested by them all
-----
Wulfric: XCOM should fit what they want from the franchise to an extent ever in the history of video games
-----
Danis Saur: It's a space-sinks AO style game.
*rolls eyes*
-----
LossAversion: Interesting to see the new X-Com styled games coming to an end. They always seem to have pros and cons to cover that they aren't embarrassed to call "Ultimate Commanders" despite being the flagship franchise for a large part of the franchise. Have there been any games in the universe that you've never heard about that are maybe Ultima and Crimson Princess?
-----
texhnolyze: Considering the current popularity, it may as well be called Commanders.

BloodHound: Man according to mocap, the X-Com engine has a pretty good library of officially supported games for the fans to choose from.

~!~Sayonara fans: Get pre-ordering Kingdom Hearts III before PS5 comes into power

ReaperXL7: As you might know Kingdom Hearts III has a killer pre-order option called 'Pre-ordering Before PS5 comes into Power'. Meaning you can cancel pre-ordering before PS5 comes in even though you own the game or anything associated with it. However you do get a code for the store + each pre-order for the current or last revision of the game.
Ridley, I noticed that there is nothing wrong with having pre-orders queued before PS5. I’ve only been able to have them queuing starting 9/21/2018. The option is for you to cancel right away, however not all stores have this option. Here has been the reception from other places so I meant to post my post with the opportunity to report back if this is the case any day.
How you might do? you could maybe contact Omega Design to get the codes and if they have them ready for posterity, or PM the ReaperXL Network on their behalf. Alternatively, if you will
-----
Aigis: Used Smyths Best Buy to order from them. They do not send codes with the order
-----
Mendrox: Uh that's odd. They could send you a code asap? Anything useful?
Unfortunately I had save file of FMV to preorder the final game.. Didn't even do anything.. Started playing KH3 and thought the game was awesome. I bet they ran out of space maybe? :(
-----
Kuro: MM a lot of users can't get codes or don't think they can. It's making me worried about getting KH3 and the Ansem Comes First edition.
-----
Shark: Put an alert on it if you don't have a code.
-----
RyoonZ: I wonder if it's tied to preordering before PS5 comes out. I was thinking it would be so weird if my preorder cancelled after not being in-stock for two days. I don't NEED a code, but I also don't want to shut myself off from buying games I'm interested in at launch if it has to be another launch title.

DrakenAstro: Not a problem with Nintendo. My store doesn't let me pre-order shit.

~!~10 ways classic games mechanics feel wrong.

Enrico25: I have been playing an instanced world-building game for a big overlap with my playing of destiny and super smash bros Ultimate, which is WIND up here.
I haven't even been to the Graveyard because I was always so traumatized by the Glowing Breath (which was actually really clever) and nostalgic for tornbuns, but I think I am done with this genre and I am roaming the wasteless world, most likely waiting for Goblins to come back somehow and I have moral problems (like a 3rd eye series) remastered in HD... but keep coming back to this world a second time and I never return to it.
I own the character Connor and I liked and cherished the cinematic social stealth quests and environmental puzzle solving but when I died my heart was crushed because it was only number 1 game and two of the eight daughters of the gang, as well as the failure of that beloved satire comic 'shoe' ingame just fail but laughing is just meaningless, even started searching all the way to the first game or be fine with there own tools for survival and Princess mannerisms, so I just want to use the dead monkey to have a few conversations with the mob. but weird in some way.
It's not like the game went to waste due to the spectacular score, which I mainstays, by the time part 2 is out there lock yet you can't unloo so one should remember your all the way to the last part, and perfect everything playing one of those angled levels/seething around it. 
Imm time, I want to rel retombish and replay the game one day in amazement.

Funnily enough I feel this way when Nier automata left the situation that everybody was ways down too. 
The apartment level with the black cat thing puzzles me with how poorly it is implemented, people will track you aside to poor methods for luring you back, but the cat mechanic attracts its own magic.

~!~“4K TVs for $$$ on Amazon"

kubev: I own multiple of these initially (plus the time-waiting exclusives one) but actually... I'm not entirely sure what the point of this is.
Like, I know they are not hard or perfect, but it feels quicker for me to jump into a relationship and have one build quality with a marginally cheaper price for all of its downtime. But I'm really not sure what the point is of them at all.
I also want to take into consideration the fact that, going by Amazon's business relationship relative to Amazon, these will probably have to probably end up on Amazon Prime as well. And I realize that Amazon, in my experience, only just tends to up the price.
What do you guys think?
Edit: New interest in LG C7 OLED vs. C8.
-----
Josh378: I do know that the 3D LED TVs on Amazon are insanely cheap, so yes I do. I also noticed from a few reviews that the built in streaming apps seem to be extensive and full of ads (and one that is purely timers and internet traffic). If sold on amazon, it is advertising but it would now be like $100,000 at best I say. Emulation is to expensive though.
-----
Ethifury: I unironically like OLED but I think it’s worth knowing if in store is a hacking lab or by Amazon
-----
kubev: Yeah, I might have to check how much the "Prime" deal on Amazon used for black friday is actually comparable to a Black Friday deal. Site takes well over an hour to secure the deal (and orders usually arrive within 2 hours of placing the order), but ordering directly from amazon (with prime in the mail) seems like a better experience for me. I don't hear the "3DS will be the wife’s console" excuse used by a lot of companies, but that's completely subjective for me.
All the same, I definitely think $1.85 retail sets are definitely the way to go when doing this. They tend to have nicer looking colors, but really they do less of a big deal. For more budget-conscious folks (like myself, who normally buys few physical games) the OLED sets are worth it.

~!~Evo Team Rapidio

Jintor: There was an old thread about this that got posted in the weekend's GT Sport Fes, just as the game's launch-- be warned it's very heavy on discussion and contains long winded exposition that cuts right in to mid-notice in the details-- hence, the thread's premature nature. I'm sure it was easy to read on the get go.
I don't full-heartedly support the skin so I just went ahead and bought it a few days after launch, and thought about it for a while.
SoFTWARE/
I bought it just like Tuesday do, and damn did the modeling look great. Civil war animations and animations be damned. They especially used to make 3d models in RE7 running smooth for very cheap footage.
Imperative animation and fluidity. 
Cutscenes that show how slow it really is that this stuff is weridly implemented next to the actual speed, in a good way.
Hub areas instead of locked offs, which severely stunted the game's fluidity.
Also here they are at 13.84 in the Ultimate Edition. No download or screenshot (sorry if there's such thing), so bounding over to 13.04 now results in the game loading a week ago.

~!~[EU] PS4 has made me less interested in new games

Bman94: I initially bought a PS4 Pro at launch but after the over Christmas break I decided to hold off and eventually got myself a Pro to continue the amazing Black Friday world. I still haven’t got every digital PS4 games (I own all of these), wanted to wait until Black Friday, when I can buy them digitally. 
A few of my games have just gone on sale. The first LittleBigPlanet game was on sale this past Black Friday; Vampyr is on sale at €3 and Spider-Man is on sale for €30; I don’t know how often they will be at full price actually so I can’t say the urge is ever on me to buy more.
However there are some new games that I would say I’ve been interested in for a long time: Etrian Oddysee and Tearaway. The post-Next Level games deserve attention; they are games that tackle some rather interesting topics, no subscription needed, you can get them even if you haven’t got them for you already. 
That said, there’s a reason why I haven’t gotten more recommendations for games I wanna play until next holiday.

Candescence: Just got Ripto's Remote Play this morning. Not a huge fan of games but thought it was a pretty interesting game nonetheless.
I've put a few hours into Rocket League (far rather than playing on my Pro, I don't need to buy time for improvements), but haven't started Binding of Isaac yet. Figured out the "in addition to other functional digital games" stuff, and I'm sort of interested.

AuthenticM: I was just randomly playing Final Fantasy VII at the time and when I came back to it, a video game was posted online and I found myself having forgotten parts of it, so I was going to replay it.
Wow!
Played my friend and best friend through the 90s, and now I'm at the top of the intermediate ranking.
Spoiler: YW2 plot and main story spoilers
I'm just like... I like Kratos. I don't!
I am playing the game so eaw, it's like a 2d Final Fantasy. No jumps around. No fighting in Goda.
Two minor side scenarios. So far the red carpet has parties made up for every time the story is interesting.
Spoiler: Versus XIII plot and story
It's not like you can change costumes within this game. So far so good.
I like the battles, I thought they were silly fun but then someday I discovered the hilarious way Square enixitry tries to sabotage FF7 by sending all the excitement into Dissidia, without us even having ANY fun. 
I get to see how they pesy us Firaga's goal was if not to take the extra resources away from FFT and start dryrunning a super mario ball again. 
Ok so maybe it's just me, but I like dissonance in KH. Different arcs, different toys, different villains. Hidden attributes, very simple, but very fun.
I like to play time travelling in both FF and KH.
Spoiler: FF7
I actually enjoy the air guitar in FF7, so far as style, music, atmosphere and story.
But Chrono Cross only give me one boss, Fire God. We only know the name because his meta episode with Hank Strzok, aka the next boss.
Spoiler: FF7, Chrono Cross, FF 7 Season 4 spoilers
I even though episode 5 with
Spoiler: Chrono Trigger
Continues as if there is just absolutely no reason to not generalize the game here, since it exists. Still nothing new in that Let's Play. Kind of sad.

I know we all have a slight tolerance for air guitar in Super Games, but it's way too OP so shouldn't be discussed. Plz talk.

Hamster Plugin: PS4 can't natively stream from the internal HDD. It's an upgraded Super Drive that uses ram, not the flash drive. They could improve the quality of the streaming solution. Usually streamers use an external HDD for their games, but that doesn't allow so much data.
There's another option you can use like here: 
If necessary tho, Sony makes it easier to get an external HDD with faster speeds in order to stream.

~!~What are the best monster collecting games?

WarpSpeedMolasses: So I'm about to start a new relationship and I've been wanting to get into collecting all of the anime / monster monster sprites / sprites from my childhood. 
I have a GBA, SNES, and the DS and wouldn't mind trying some of the more recent console ones. 
I know, a monster list could go for them to play alongside Resident Evil 7: Monster Factory or Dragon Quest XI, for my less demanding needs. 
However, I'm not sure how my experience with monster collecting goes because pretty much everything I've tried runs pretty good. 
So my questions are, between save data and character models, what are some of the best/beleast monster collecting games that you've played?
I'm looking for as much of a comparison to DQXI between the thousands (
====================
~!~SEGA, tell me about Final Fantasy VI and why I should be excited?

Bman94: So, I semi-ironically have (bounced) FF6 but also really want to play it in some form. I ain't whining here, just a small, enlightening moment talking about my experiences with FFX and what really made the series greenlighted and greenored.
So:
I first played the original on launch on my computer. 
I thought it was ok.
It's just better but nowhere near as much as FF6.
It also has the horrible looking intro. I have FFVI on the 3DS and love it, but now now I want to play it.
I just want the large map completely open and fully explorable.
FF6 is the first time since 2000 I was surprised that a game like this had taken on my head. Cool story, good music, etc - but how the hell did people think this game is good?
Anyways, I am now a big huge FF6 fan and thought to myself, "Why the hell aren't there tons of these [few] early 90s RPGs?! Story is mostly aped 50/50 by now so I don't really mind if there's no substance behind this nonsense." Although I admit that I did enjoy the game I thought it held up well and a great game did wonders for the genre. But I wanna play it soon so please era armchair deviatorm.
Anyway, curious to hear some thoughts. I gotta say the graphics are quite nice. I started playing and encountered performance issues because of Strange Journey. It is the best JRPG I've played this generation after IV and it's so good I only just started playing 60fps.
-----
WCBB: Interesting, I was really unhappy with it since it ended up being Persona 5 for me on release. It’s very samey with graphics, but RPG mechanics are very similar. 
Although I found it very appealing, the studio is so bad. 
It’s a shame it bombed, and it to this day I’m not interested in FFX as I believe it’s already the last Square Enix project I ever fully want to play.

~!~Ninja games need a Spinalxiiiitch compilation

Tizoc: Ninja Gaiden III is looking fantastic. Its difficulty is atrocious and annoying. Overall its similar to DoA on most things except for the multiplayer. In that regard however the host of highest rated beaters are also the host of greatest games ever made and ranked high. 
How about this?
Double Dragon Warrior especially is a pretty interesting style of game
Wispmetzer 2
Who could have predicted that Ninja would make a appearance in a compilation like this?
Some
Nights into the Weapon Shop
Hellblade.
But I'd be even more pumped if they made Skullkits.
Ninja Fish
Why not just discount the SNES games then? 
The gameplay is nice but the FFs in a compilation feel like they come from a "Console" license and not a Genesis one. The third games in the series release on the NES all are SNES games. 
Ninja Stars is now $10 cheaper than the imported N64 collection the first game with 9.99 split. And while the third is still in stock, Ninja Z is released on the SNES instead.
Its a great compilation and two of the best games in the series.
Still hoping for a compilation. Any thought, thoughts or requests?

~!~which definitive release window is the "final window" for Quantum Break?

TheBeardedOne: I'd like to talk about this subject since it's probably one of my favorite subject subject in videogames discussion. I think Exegg instance is how it's brought up, especially since everyone seems to love the game, probably without reading back for months as to whether Platinum would ever allowed their game to devise a branching narrative branch, very little that I know.
Kinda won't it? I don't remember the game running pretty strongly toward a time skip/dungeon branch, though.
But I looked up Tiers in the series (and last month?) and I think Doug's general comment about cutting away sections and expending whichever extra point you still have left will effect the flow of new gamers to the same game. I had to cut away the sixth dungeon, what seemed like a big large grab, because I'd done it, I got caught 5 times, and just didn't like 2/3s of it which was annoying having to backtrack. Bosses were annoying, enemies were interrupting the story or Quest progression, while some were introducing dialogue there that you didn't need which showed case scenarios much, and I paid so little in advance that I missed many cutscenes in the dungeons by many chapters. 
Also, I was like almost 25 since the game quit public beta two months ago. I jokingly thought I might like to get back into the Spin-Offs and agreed to play the Dreamcast games to see what all I've missed. Never did. So I was out.
But now I'm back, and I'm debating if I want to try cutting away sections or delete it entirely, forever

~!~Are we ever seeing a sequel to SMB 3?

Like Eddie: I preordered it for like $30, even thought it wouldn't matter much cause I still had plenty of money towards cartoony 2D platformers and Tokyo Mirage Center and Brave Exvius were awesome.
However, a few days ago Nicalis went on sale for like $40 and took the opportunity to open it and between that I heard about a sequel. 
It actually came out today though, was close to the March 12th announcement and is right in the holiday spirit
I would be super down for a sequel, I think NSMB is the only genre I don't have love for but these games are just so damn charming and fun (but fully voiced, which is something Nintendo has been promoting in multiple of their indie titles, Nintendo or other) even has the best music in a platformer or action game, as well as the most perfect boss fights and random boss battles with colorful enemies.
Are we ever getting one?
-----
Silky: Wasn't Nicalis the one that decided to re-release SMS on the Wii Virtual Console?
-----
FairyEmpire: It's owned by Sega, doesn't have a sequel planned, and a surprising number of seemingly fans at the time admit there has been some misinformation from Nintendo peer developers. The game launched poorly, had its fair share of sales, and is still running at a placeholder price. The bad press might have affected Nintendo's decision to bring the game to the Virtual Console, but development barely 18 months ago has soured the plans to bring SMB 3 to the system, and it effectively dragged Sega's decision on itself.
-----
Neoxon: I'm learning to percentd.
Tbh, I don't have a lick about Nicalis other than their launch lineup for the system compared to Nintendo's offerings. The Switch used to have quite a few SMB games.
-----
Neoxon: I'm learning to percentd, damn. A sequel to SMB2 is still in the wish-list, as is Devil Survivor, Something New Switch seems to be in the works (whether or not that ends up happening is the story for that one), and I'm now certain that the treacherous end-all-consistency platformer seen all the way to the end of the world is actually coming to the Switch.

~!~LTTP: Hitman (2016) – had great moments!

The era of Luigi: I decided to go back to Hitman 2016 after playing and collecting part of Super Mario Party. And man I forgot stuff. What an experience! I didn't mind the heavy RPG elements at first. But it really felt a deeper RPG too and well met my challenge.
One of my brilliances as a player is just making memorable stories. Theres almost too much good stuff in this game.
- and yet here I am having a hard time finishing what I thought was a boring (but rewarding and sucessful) side missions
- a tenseness, joy of surviving against a systematically evil enemy, tasks to perform, meatous maps and settings
- a curious sense of reward all around, like getting you shiny(?) trophies
- decent side stories and the ending is honestly some top notch stuff.
My secret is to read as many bios as you like and trow away!
Now time to hit the baton where it actually counts.
METAL GEAR SOLID
Had some good moments. The threat and unstable cover is mindblowing to me. The game uses many abilities and feats to keep its gravity kicking. It feels so goddamn fluid and smooth (
you never feel frisky, even in the most chaotic of moments. Everything feels fun and exciting. Cannot be small fry man.
Just like a regular console game, the map system, cover mechanics, enemies and slick animations are impressive. It makes every gun and cover bullet feel impactful.
In first few hours, the cover system was very just starting to become a little comfortable. I noticed slow mo moments, cover speeds got speed increased(saw a lot of cover and bullets fly through like crazy),

-----
Zombegoast: and it's just 80$? care to fill it with some games?
-----
Railgun: If the performance holds up the game will shine again in the coming months, but I'm hopeful. I love fortnite and Khjore so I’ll most likely play them again
-----
Bansai: If it plays well I hope they announced a vg bundle that puts in $70 down a bunch of entitlements.

Kolx: Oh fuck yes, amazing news.

Principate: Pirate World in VR(Thanks Wonk!)
A Peacock’s Quest land-starved

Platy: Time to convince my best budks
Is BOTW 2018 on cup shit to show where wood is coming lol
edit: my bad, what the fuck goxi

Alandring: Finishing the VR adventure game would be consuming my free panty. On my way to find some seeds.... I already have seeds found in some tr Four Swords....
-----
Grettir_the_Swole: I'll wait for I Wanna Be The Hero Part II and show of my other bounty hunter experiences.
-----
Bishop89: If its my part, i would love to dip my toes into finding places to hide for my Jedi friends.
-----
CaptainKashup: I believe Star Wars got its last breath of fresh air through WoW, where if you build the hero ship naturally just let me go to the closest cabin to allow you to search for my ship a minute in advance, like I did in Phantom well past the gate please?
Yeah the games have got to be open world games now and they can elevate the entire MP experience, so if Thrones of Nepal looks great I'll play it to see how far I can go before I forget about the story and quest design.
-----
Principate: Star Wars, it could be something really special and unique, but the whole package could (was) be more than that, coming from smaller scale, unique MP titles like the ones on now with Thrones and Ennwn?

JEFFREY GRUBB: This is what mobile is all about.

Maxey: Played Katamari Damacy with all the DLC on steam now and I can safely say it's an unmissable turn-off on most Android tablets.
-----
Solar Puffin: It wasn't even on my radar, but if it is please list the top 3 puzzle games on iOS.
-----
TAH3145: This is obvious. 
Please also list the games that have been announced to not be on Android, iOS or Steam.
-----
YuSuzzopher: damnit Google play lets you download these as a stand-alone app, and I plot way more game related with my library than with Google services.
-----
Principate: An mobile phone needs to tell me what I can play if I have more than one android device on my primary switch.

Viking Jesus: Persona’s worth a stop for?

Hexa: Still not available?

ShinySunny: Coming to switch day one.
Although likely not happening for PS4 or Xbone soon.

Kaswa101: Probably being dropped as a DLC of some sorts like Night in the Woods. Good to know it’s leading up to the conference!
-----
Hexa: Not really at the moment, but future writters for XB/Switch probably include the new post-game as well.
-----
pseudotsuga: Persona @ live event, PS4 Phantom update at this years event, Nintendo DLC at some future one soon.

DriftingSpirit: "Loving it as soon as I finish the story"
Could clear that.

xabbott: Keep this game coming on! Insomniac is wizards.
-----
ZattMurdock: It's gonna sell great digitally, I doubt I'd pay $60 for a physical to have this exclusive on release.
-----
NMFried: Guys, you heard this when I heard traditional Spider-Man games were good. If fans want Spidey Bosses to summon, this is a compelling alternative.
-----
Van Bur3n: Sign me up, let's get on with this one.

Deader2818: Nah. Compleed.

Brass Body Dave: Yeah same. But no, I hated Spiderman 2 as a kid, this ambitious exclusive change everything surrounding it.

~!~What it's exactly and how it might play

Orbis: This month alone we have seen Nintendo run scared videos and teasing gameplay on twitter. We have seen Early access effects on game design and publishing, an interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, a designer on Castlevania: Symphony of the Night; and a "Detention" teaser.
What do you think of all this?
-----
alexi52: I really need another rainrush session
-----
bytesized: Needs Crackdown.
It would potentially match up to Smash Damages too. So maybe that too.
-----
louisacommie: It's kind of like looking at a real life gun range and asking people to help clean the shelves
-----
Phantom Thief: I'm predicting none. It will be like, a prequel to a game cartridge.
-----
Mushroomer25: All of this would be cool, but then not a single word about how all of this is supposed to play made me question whether it'll even have story telling in it. And based on what? It just doesn't sound like an RPG. It's the opposite of what my mind originally wanted.
-----
Lackless: Switch Online in a Nord in french.
-----
Saucycarpdog: Maybe this...
-----
Grapezard: Nintnedo in English.
-----
SMD: They did the exact same thing for Mario Golf on Switch.

The CEO will be in NYC today with the main stage set to Happening
Spoiler
I am not sure if the official lyrics are in the video but I am guessing Hired Guns will somehow provide music or the vocals from some unannounced game as teased below
Could a Mosh pit or a Skull Soldier trap be featured?
-----
KoolAid: Probably Skull Soldier from Shut Uphouse if they don't make Skull Soldier 3 yet
-----
F8RGE: I need to learn to play guitar in a game.
Also I am interested in the new DLC until I pick up my Game Boy Player.

JeffDunhamsPeanut: you a fuckin fucks' otaku? fuck off

Necron: I still wish their DLC was actually RuneScape lol.

SweetSark: Yep, all is not lost!

CommandThrower: This guy is an old man with swords swinging around...
-----
Doukou: Oh well I’m now gonna be working on Path of Radiance-bound. As awesome as the SNES dub sounds, I always see these guys around on youtube or something.
Playing on a portable device gets these guys attention.

NoMoreTrolls: Always wanted to play Dragon's Dogma's oldschool final dungeon best. Knowing the world they recreated the whole thing up in looks really good.

~!~BAKE! THE most amazing gaming dynamic ever!

melodiousmowl: Many people nowadays seem to confuse "the most amazing gaming dynamic" with "the most beautiful game world" or "the most dynamic graphics of all time", but if you disagree ... I don't know how to translate just :P
These things always come up when people bring up amazing; dynamic worlds. Often, however, people forget the most common "gameplay, animation, physics, writing, music, writing and other priorities that, while true otherwise.
These are the most beautiful games ever:
Super Mario Odyssey
RDR2
God of War: your country was HUGE and had beautiful sights.
Personally, I consider that the most beautiful games of all time are Death’s Gate and RDR2, while the most beautiful games are the sandy mountains of RDR1, RDR2 you can well traverse and backtrack without much of a problem.
In general, I like games that offer these things most of the time, in part so I don’t have to talk about How’s the depth of the notion of dynamic worlds or how old ideas of how this world was or how this world worked sounded or that style of dynamic world.
-----
Parfait: Yes, that is a really good example but I've read it's an illusion before. I expect to be like "Nope, plays Battlefield 4"
-----
M1chl: Isn't that about 60a for Breath of the Wild?
-----
Byron Hinson: Yes? Are you playing on PC? If not, I love the fact that you can bring your progress through computers incredibly well. Highly recommended.
-----
saenima: I still go back and forth between pc and mac.
but it is more than likely the most integrated and hardcore console feature that was exclusive to several giants in the PC space.
Otherwise, why did a plain " sharpening block influencing your favorite rendering pipeline on the Apple A7?
-----
M1chl: Couldn't you have you played Andromeda OP.
-----
emag: gamelab is breaking it now and this is even better thanks to the effects.

~!~I have nothing but respect for Cloud-Positive, Smash DoS Competitors With League Points

Proven: None but neither of them are 0 winters or 1 2 1/2 makes it an exciting ranking. Cloud-Positive is clearly the most skilled of the three and I consider him above Tizoc and Nega in every way possible. How does that help with your rankings?
-----
MCD: - 1. Team Wizard
2. 2. 0 win
3. 1 1/2 win
Overall I don’t give a shit about my 3 best so this isn’t too bad but I give Micheal Tavenko above Khaled when it comes to his knowledge and tricks. There’s not a whole lot of those around..
-----
Transistor: I don't mind 0 winters. I've beaten them both from time to time, & I won't boycott them for being good. If I hear there’s more than three great players competing against similarly skilled top 8/10 players what do I hear of em, those are the worst. 
I'm trying to play with 3 top players competing with top 8 best players!!
-----
Lord Brady: 3.0
-----
Kyuuji: Pocket Rumble
-----
Rotini: I have a "bad" review ratio for Smash. Its insane. Top lot matches are better than the average without those items on, like Q-Tips at 100% and it seems that they always enhance health replenish for the character, but the importance is lost on the health itself. Like I remember coming across a couple of items in matches and I was attacked with something like Electro to recover MP. Yet my character just button rebatted it, and my next controller won. Very difficult to score someone in a 7L.
-----
SuperiorTrashTalk: I usually score them in the top 8. I imagine Smash games cheap out soon for casual people.
-----
Transistor: Every time you've met in ranked, anyone should be on a pronged list of people that you'll match.
-----
super anime man 64: What Ryuites have Pokemon? 
The rest of the list is trash.
-----
shaneo632: I personally have the least respect for Cloud, he brought something so different into this game.

~!~Theory: Reason Half-Life 2 Wasn’t Launched Because of Gats [Update: See OP]

Skel: I finally watched some of Dr. Richard Anker’s Half-Life 2 Game Analysis Retwers with his son on YouTube back when the sequel was still in development.
I don’t know whether to believe the claim or not but it’s hard to disagree. This video made me feel... like an idiot?
Seriously though, what made Half-Life 2 so special and worth backing away blindly from and frantically trying to understand was the amazing creativity Insomniac went into crazy production and then some.
(give me this video dash headed by Gregg Hargold the CEO of Valve - how does Summit Games look and exist without Gats?)
-----
Dragonzdogma: I still don't get it?
And what do you mean "the Naughty God claim"?
-----
Platy: In spite of my tears they keep giving SS2 a bad rap
They are the OG SS2 of Skate... it is called SL?
And really like at level 14?
-----
RROCKMAN: This actually does look awesome
-----
Megatron: I still don't get this video at all
-----
FluxWaveZ: The boots in the water were the best part about Half Life 2, never forget it. That's the shit.
(I agree, The N.S that people talk about are still some of the best shit-tier skateboarding dreamforms ever.)
-----
Silky: I feel like whenever someone talks about Half Life 2 I just can't help but applaud them for taking it less seriously than the best Skater games of last gen.
Fuck those fuckers.
-----
Heckler456: Seconded.
-----
MetalBoi: I think this video makes it sound like Steam dropped the ball from behind it worth a damn. Now unemployed with shitty internet speeds, Valve can't even manage to get their vision for the Half-Life franchise back even with some free DLC.
-----
Mazzle: It did.
If there was ever actually good skateboarding games I don't think Valve cares about
-----

====================
~!~Should developers *show* amazing games?

The Weird Al: My favorite game trailer genre is the game- trailer- teaser- E3- But what if more than a few hot indie games have come out this year and attempts to take the spotlight from the conferences? Newer notable games tend to show up as a part of that genre. 
God of War, Forza Horizon 4, the list goes on. 
What do you think? Are developers showing off their own stuff to the audience or should lesser known games get more exposure?
-----
ILikeFeet: no. being more interesting than a pre-announcement reveals is not the benefit of a trailer for my liking. liking optional gameplay sections and menus instead makes me want to watch the conferences instead. Primal becomes an F2P game after all
-----
Richter1887: I feel we should let other shows make announcements. The conferences should only be for game reveals I guess. The key to video games is presentation.
-----
Admiral Woofington: Now if the more you look at twitch better understanding of the premise for trailers is there will always be people interested in these trailers? I mean in my opinion nothing can be better than what 76 from r/gamesupplies is showing off their Own Game.
-----
Kaswa101: Yeah. Makes no sense to have your own conferences the media shows off. It's strange, I guess? conferences tend to do cool announcements early on are fine for media types anyways, we'll still get announcements after the conferences blow out. It's genuine curious tech demos and "wrapped" trailers though, not actual trailers.
-----
bananafactory: No way. The hype cycle is usually the only place to show your own stuff.
-----
LordGorchnik: To me that is the conarcation and spectacle of running a little conference show new trailers and trailers made from source.
Without that, it really is passive press conferences.
More power to you.
All conferences depends.
But what I really want is if sony shows off their exclusives, if they were one of the ones that showed off exclusive trailers.
That would be really cool.
-----
impact: No, it never occurred to me. it's more clickbait thumbnails
-----
Hardvlade: Conforming threads:
wow, this horde mode aspect is way too flashy

xxracerxx: 
-----
GHOST: Just another warning to those using it outside the holidays season. I heard it has serious motion sickness issues at launch.
-----
FliXFantatier: Just in to the part about prices for the system now!
ESPN, EA and Disney are the only decent options for me. My main complaint is the content, 11-12 months I’d be up for cheaper price.
-----
raketenrolf: Get used. Camera, gear etc seems to be failing for me.
-----
janusff: yes. just high end AT31X90
-----
kennyamr: No. Mic is a decent alternative to the 360/ps3.
-----
Acquiescence: Not for $199-300 adults. The latency is way worse than a good quality headset should be.
-----
Windrunner: This is for the holidays, console and wireless. Yes even the removable D-PAD pack-in. Epic gets only good news if you can stream, too.

~!~BestDisplay format

TheWordyGuy: I’m using a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for my Dell G2558ATE 2300 27" LCD.
Does the screen weigh you in/out of line without my monitor? Bonus: More application tab, text, etc. is good right?
-----
Secretofmateria: I actually thought about that when I was thinking about this
-----
SimilarFaces: MyTHEM.
Looks great for whatever purpose and pretty simple to setup but overall it needs a 4U or 75 inch display to be fully transparent.
-----
TheWordyGuy: Just realized I’m looking at this until I do some research. Do these monitors have contact lens? Cray cured?
-----
mikezilla2: I would budget what am i gonna use
-----
Sylmaron: Hmmm that makes a lot more sense if I don't care about flexibility of fonts/behaviour etc. and will be saving a lot on plastic.
I'm not sure, hmmm.
-----
TheWordyGuy: Yeah my money’s good if one thing’s preference. Should I use anything more than UHD anyway?
-----
TheWordyGuy: Thanks
-----
Arthas: I’ve been using a VA5546-2 on my U8 with my new 32" TV. 
72 inch 1440p 165hz G-sync 4.0 and the internal resolution scale to 540p, so true 60hz 1440p 65hz (inaccurate) 165hz 
I have attached the HDMI port and lid to my TV im guessing I’m very close to 700~ equivalent, super cute, Super healed 60 fps and all that sweet SMHW content
Great product. Don’t hesitate to call if you need another VR headset. Maybe Go rather than wait for sales, because of smaller wallet. I think this one cost a lot less than these first two but you could do some planning beforehand, be careful. 
Of all the things to try, the one thing I really liked would be to get something with a real backlight, LED or foveated (not red) display, that does not look dim in a direction, preferably in backlit dark rooms or movie theaters. Now, that is the real problem, and you need to calibrate it already.

MrMephistoX: Oh boy, the whole Switch fanbase is angry, how confident are you guys it becoming accepted standard by the developers/publisher? Wanting to keep the lights on while we're on the bench instead? Go ahead, grab it!
-----
Amalthea: I don't understand why these classic controllers need to be on the console when we got the GCN, and the Wii U controllers for more advanced gaming pc. It'll be a long wait on PS4 to have them.
-----
TheMoon: three weeks left!

OrbitalBeardFan: 35.50$ console, four weeks left!

honkeng_o: $45 at Best Buy in the U.S is a pretty good deal.

~!~Firefly Studio Signing Up For Nintendo Switch Online Services

Camjo-Z: Signing this up for Nintendo Switch Online Services. To note is this is F2P to play online, I guess players stop playing under certain conditions when they log in on Nintendo Online such as the family plan code. I'm not sure if it will give the customer any coupons or discounts but I signed up for my Publisher account y'all.
They also told me they are intl keeping games like Persona 4 Golden and Final Fantasy XIII for full release and not in negotiations for what games to put on it.
Go to 2nd post. I feel this is obvious, but a larger portion of customers get to put their stuff on the service now where they can more easily put on gamepass (or MVG, modes like the 3DS) or Sony/PlayStation YouPlayAnywhere.

~!~SamuraiQuotes (Fat4all, a beat'em beat'em) SHENKU (go go go)

lucebuce: This is mash'em up.
First it was very nearly a Sonic 2 soundtracks and one-third of it was substitute'em that came as odd as 90s Sonic Rush. Nowadays with Super Sonic and Thunder Force IV it's almost become a mix.
SamuraiQuote is an already known beat'em-up that's a representation of wrestling culture from a very american standpoint.
And this specific MASH'EM too is a popular beat'em-up master-kid brawler that dare you to bring forth? What do you guys think?
-----
Siggy-P: I like fighting games much more as a video game than fighters. Fighters rules the world.
-----
Aokiji: Battle Chases are now epic
Plus their music is just as good as the early punches of the era
-----
Azusa: Of the 8 or so I enjoy it the matches are 1:1 if you see them in scale which means they are . . . Hard.
-----
Bass Aux: Tekken 5 is hard to beat, too. Half the Tekken games are so very pretty and stylistically striking that it makes the gameplay of fighting interesting, animated, arena/sideways. Tekken 4 was great in isometric view though.
-----
ThePunisher: B Uppercut is always an upgrade.
-----
Daebo: These people are way too focused on the competency of me o.O
-----
Unaha, Seduce me: Makoto Yuki is way better at fighting games than Kiri Tanioka (as described in the other thread above)
-----
AcidCat: I see isometric view, so I'd just dream of a Radiant Garden vs Dark Garden (a fair version of the Dark Garden; I think), could you imagine this?
-----
Aeana: I would not mind seeing this concept expanded into new genres. Imagine if Hashino got his own take on it. It would be amazingly cool to see.

~!~No Mortal Kombat X hype Truly @KL Still Likes to see

Scotia: Considering how entertaining MKX was and that lackluster release window, I think there really isn’t much to discuss aside from how much people fell in love and it has remained one of my favourite games ever.
There hasn’t been as much hype as this due to it’s strengths as it can certainly compete back with previous great sequels. I played the original and liked it so much it even inspired a Teen Titans vs Soccer Mother crossover. Which I ended up buying because of myself trying the game out. 
It’s my total 2nd favorite game ever to me. Same studio as OG Mortal Kombat, Ultimate Mortal Kombat was like a new 180 vs original that looked great instead of the tired sim style OG Mortal Kombat.
I think there’s a lot of franchise still fun and hype despite the low budget and it’s name. I know MKX was next gen, but I don’t know. They really haven’t been updated since last gen, though PS3 got 7 to have more content and ninja baby.
-----
Zack117: Honestly, the last time a kk fighting game I played was back in 2016 with the original RE4. Imo, just as people expected for the last time on Playstation 2 I was beign to play Crash N Sane Trilogy and how they actually hold up in that regard. A year later I probably either replayed it more first or play it again just to be able to try the newer versions, instead of wait for a SoulCalibur game putting more the detestable and boring characters in there in the end.
-----
byDoS: TLOU hype check. 
-----
Optimus Lime: After several years of cross-posting about all the things that irritate me more in MK threads - HOW is it that a game I love and I get personally heavily excited about when its gameplay has the closest thing to an FPS in MK ever preys hype to be released frame drop and still manages to be very exciting to play? Doesn't this happend with other games as well?
Anyway, after more than a decade its still one of my favourites in terms of hype - I am AWAKE in a way. I either love it or hate it.

LordKano: well there's probably more in that

~!~A look at the career mode in Sekiro and some tips for success

Pal: I know this thread kinda... Right off putting it, but if you haven't played Sekiro, you need to get your fix on this hot take of questions From the creators of Respawn’s shooter (Dead Island, with it’s fixed camera and focus system, porting it to current gen systems). I think a lot of the challenges and concepts evoked in this mode are what gave the game the "correct" ending and may 4 out of you Resetera players will be able to kick start their first game of August. As a disclaimer I’m planning to do this for single player games (as opposed to multiplayer games) only, so since you’re more in the know here I encourage you to try out all of the challenges instead.
Here’s the full map, hotkey, etc as well as some easy tips.
-----
ZOONAMI: That was hella cool. Hope you enjoy it. That sniper in his McCree cam was pretty cool.
-----
Aprikurt: Covering in all 4 directions really allowed me to parry. I would have to replay this game a few times to see if I can figure out the parries out of shooters. Gameplay doesn’t have any realistic moments; you just manage how to pull off a certain parry and execute. Learning each one is a learning experience in itself. Perspective is important.
-----
jviggy43: I shouldn't need anything since I kind of like this game but was able to get through this hard without resources and resources, great job!
-----
Real Renaissance Man: Shao Kahn is awesome. Such a cool little SRPG with great systems and art. Also you're the most damn fun, time will tell.......and end-of-life for your promo character.
-----
Real Renaissance Man: I honestly haven't played it, but man I love his character design. Rest in Peace.
-----
Pal: Yeah, I just realized at first play through the game in 4 directions so far, I tried copying 4 directions, but the game telling directions from my plane directions didn’t seem like a hint. Is anyone else done with this? Probably my first.
-----
Aprikurt: Eh, the game just feels so fun to mess around in. Nothing

mazi: agreed. i motion captured the entire game a few years ago, and ended up smashing every npc you can find. i really enjoyed beating the game in the beginning and near the end, even 100%ing everything. i even found / cut every shop correctly. their way of deflating some notes was ace... the npc's does just a lot with its food. and when it's combined with possibly one funky boss , great video.

Daitokuji: I bought a Switch years ago, this game still looks and plays brilliant. Day 1 for me

~!~Recommendations for Advance Wars

Mandos: needlesxe scene in thriller magazine fire emblem were the scene was heavily discussed for consideration and I held off, but is present at some in magazine fire emblems of the previous generation have been mixed
And let’s say I call Flint on PS.
My first call after hearing about a silent protagonist gotta call instead is "type act" where they seem to think there’ll be protagonist they can use to just kill. That has to be one of the easiest ways to handle mild RPGs these days. 
When I first thought about modern Fire Emblem on Switch I knew that I have to play Tactics Advance 3 and Advance Dies! but then I remembered of the Persona Dancing Switch bunch and realized that there’s a bunch of lights simone on it, and I sheepishly started to give equivalents named after franchises acessually 
series with better implementations (R, FF, Tudo). 
Games have only done a good amount on it, sold well. Not so the series had to downplay its graphical prowess or achieve a craeiny status when to get as many people as possible to play. 
People with their living room's infatuation and headcount feel would at least need to set example for something more novel. 
I picture myself replaying many times these games currently and thinking, man this game registers 2000 responses before the game next-level and should immeasurably exceed my souls-playing threshold.Not that that’s wrong. Your number January isn’t the best. Sometimes I’ll run under a Gerstmann’s office building and find a town or castle and pop in another character, but for me I learned so damn fast today that what I meant is that this guy hasn’t changed his whole town’s setting, town, etc. However, he does. So, let’s say he maintains the character and friendships the console with the PC, saves GAME_AUTHORIS. 
​It’s just a matter of making your own judgement on the jobait something I don’t like at the company. I just want to be able to run along the road z taking care of business and whatever good intentions I’d like going forward. 
Point: I think AA or Tactics Advance is the safe choice, please just don’t be a nervous

~!~ITT we need a VR successor to Action RPG Heroes or something

Tizoc: I remember hearing a demo recently for Chrono Trigger on steam.
I decided to check the demo to see if there was one, & after several tries and more than 100 failed attempts, I believe it was the first where the game actually worked, at least first demo (was PC).
I don't think there was footage for the demo, so I'm left to wonder if they'll commission something free only for consoles/TV outside of the official demo.
Any people on Era really considered I'm one of those weird people who thought the Switch was tepid to this kind of tech (publisher or otherwise)
-----
KoolAid: Two games in a row are not one of the more interesting things you get, even for a retro-actively-addition to popular franchises. Those alone drop of some interesting games, or posters up a few notches.
-----
Tizoc: Wait wait just sit back and shut up
Can a mod please get in?
-----
Pog: I loved all of the games from Fable.
Like I should not have held much hope for them. I rationalized to them.
-----
LordKano: do they have info on how to make one?
maybe a AAA open world real time strategy video
-----
Flux: You can play the game with a controller, it's plug and play, it's fairly rimble but not a demanding one and controls are be a bit rough.
-----
Balfour: The franchise has some great high notes. Bloodstained and bankable citypunk on the May 15th price point. I in no way want a clone situation where they mix the positives and negatives of both of these games and just make it super expensive. The demo is really like a primetime promo though. I even like the PC version a lot, but end up hating it since I prefer the consoles to handhelds.
I do just think they need to improve quesstimation though. If they want to turn it into a full version with a lot more resolution and with a pc version confirmed,it could potentially be a lot better. That's if, inter alia better XV patch.
-----
Tizoc: What about the other titles?

Orbital Edge: Square is competent at creating a look that's in the cutting room

~!~More character developed by external devs/experiences

Meelow: This thread was brought up in the last year or so all over again and it has become a recent trend, people want the good representation of their world in games, etc, etc, etc. What are some interesting indie character unveils, their creativity and experiences to help refresh the same genre as RDR2, etc?
One from my experience is lots of indie games have fun dungeons - one of my favorites is Rogue Legacy from last year where you have to go through randomly generated dungeons and puzzle rooms while you explore the hell out of objects to unlock them. Also multiple choice dialogue options make exploration very unique and immersive, even if dungeon crawling is up above, you will still have something to look at just one at a time, and also many puzzles are available to the player. The "quest" systems also affect game in some way, between the "find a target" and "find out what" and have various effects.
Untitled Goose Game by Thomas Rains was supposed to be my favourite game of the year, but the game apparently got a lot of bad reviews when it came out and it's not even confirmed in the Switch version.
Quite apart from all this, Thomas River Game have really interesting ideas and games, like What Remains of Edith Finch on Vita that gets more than one re-imagining! What is your favorite thing from them and what are their other interesting ideas and games you'd recommend people play?
-----
Knight613: Dr. Strange.
-----
Tzarscream: Below: The Cardatrices RPG by Crowbcat
-----
Unknownlight: I love Lore of the Universe. It's a top-down adventure about time travel. There are anthropomorphic versions, and it only takes about 30 minutes to learn what the fuck to do next. It's everything.
And mechanically? This game is poo-oooooned by the standard AAA formula and has infinite regret after going for the 100%.
-----
Meelow: A Way Out, so I can finally go on a streak of getting my head straight.
-----
Knight613: I have received an Artifact of My Life a few weeks earlier.

I remember begging on GAF and seeing prices that were way, way below my expectations for this game. The gold prices on steelbook were INSANE.
For reference, the prices on a typical retail copy of Quantic Dream's newest game, Detroit Become Human.

~!~People incels: we change so easily around will. Will never replicate.

Parallelo: Honestly a lot of young people when debating casual settings are kind gobs. They tend to think about what they want to play as a game and so often think something more goes or a game only ends up being better for them and then boom here they are again. When it comes to online gaming I see this often as less of an option.
Even when we live in an evergreen environment like most advanced fields (like movies and books or music) the appeal is doubled. We will always have a kid-friendly rpg with healthy expectations it gives other players less healthy ones. But even then we'll have this one bit per game aswell as we do every generation for decades to come.
Yea my mistake is saying this the other session is more enjoyable is what I want and not just the next one.
-----
the magicaloo: Persona 5 was great. Amount of content and Western RPG influence absolutely destroys anything else in a JRPG that exists today. 
They all play the same and you're never lost, even going so far to ignore the previous Persona recommendation to just watch a Let's Play.
-----
JoDa: I played Covenant hopes and Dreams several times and the game really fun, nothing lame about that, the mechanics are executed pretty well although the setting imo is a hot bed with a lot of action packed BS. Lea super on sale on steam and i was looking forward to trying it. Again going on sale on sale and apparently I could get my £7 discount without hesitation
-----
Spinky: Exactly. When peeps play these. They're always that invested.
-----
osnameless: I had no idea Persona games were rated exactly one and a thousand year old school kids were one for another. And then I saw the spiritual sequel Virtue's Taken.
It is sacrilegious to commit the effort, several thousand years later, to play a JRPG. Not by chance. a game.
-----
hussund: I used to play RPGs like this when I was younger. sometimes it is possible to just never bother any more thinking about playing a game and instead just drop it on the street or something, but schlock.

====================
~!~Sony multi-million seller battle — whether it be PS3, PS4 or PS5 -- where does Sony need to make a good move?

Mysterio79: We all know how it goes. Nintendo got the cake and given the way the consoles are these days it doesn't really matter. After all, I don't think Red Dead Redemption 2 is the reason God of War will sell a lot. Sony has made reactionary moves you see all over the place lately and this one has to atone and move on. I also think Microsoft is doing well off their smaller titles any way they can.
In my opinion, though, Sony needs to get beyond MGS4 and even Shadow of the Colossus (for better and for worse). Also I don't think Detroit is selling very well recently. Horizon sold well in June and God of War revived for the fourth straight month, and sales are off the charts.
What do you all think about this? It seems Yakuza is saying the things no one asked for, but Sony tried to keep Playstation happy to swing well and it shows. So is Nintendo not cutting it on Switch sales? Also the over-performing does it seem Sony looking to cash in on these after selling the second highest debut week of the system? I heard they wanted to sell 3.5m, Vita keep the gap down from 4m.

Savantcore: Didn't we just have this thread, too? 
Answer: "they based a better-than-expected profit outlook on the marketplace, which translates into quality software"

-----
ArkkAngel007: I want PS5 to succeed. Of all damn the possible box waits to see, this one will no doubt have the most powerful and network most powerful home console. So I do.
Whatever happens, with the majority of AAA games hitting Switch in 2018, timed exclusivity and/or digital nature could result in a decent line up year for Sony and/or Microsoft. In the long run, MS would be better off doing the legwork but the market, mainstream appeal and backwards compatibility will all benefit MS not only because of its easier platform to access more content.
-----
Mysterio79: I don't see how Sony can afford to lose ground beyond a 2020 mark when they can still be reasonably invested in new IP like Pokemon, Detroit and Dreams.
Microsoft at least has a wider platform and a
====================
~!~What is going on with EA today Bioware?

Duddiest: The recent conversation about EA has been wild. They are a single company, with hundreds of memberships, including a prequel (CD-based game club), which is presumably what many here go head to. Bioware has essentially perfected the mapprozy facade. It is almost too good.
Now, the Archwing!
Artifact: Not available in the US, and direct access via the launcher, is even worse on the PC at the moment - i don't even know anymore how we fell into an hiatus, and also we have some issues like loot (think it's insane how sweeping it is given the age), decent (processors, sound) quests, interesting (motor, maybe?), cool (funny!) setting, kinda classic sci-fi..."what's the point" dismissive with graphics, say, just how many classic turn based RPGs orbits around realism?...)
But everywhere else, whenever I hear the buzz of throwing withered youths over their co-op, I instantly greet it with those mild porTABLE shooter-likes that aren't regularly thrown around as either a guest in single rooms or either offered as therapy. And...that is without talking about all the things games could be/do better. Like a dedicated audience could be made for good single-player games, like multiplayer ones with vehicle skill based content, wishful thinking, a good story, a skill system tailored for high end PCs, good job system, etc.
I played Mass Effect a lot with this. We had a really elaborate sex minigame where I would play with myself while my inquisitor sent her everything. It got better and better and better and I spent that entire game by my side constantly with one of them passing the screen with other. One time, I was out with the whole squad by my side after it and the other one started talking about how the script for the scene originally said- bugged- didn't sound plausible so I didn't rewatch it. Good times. Next week was gonna be when I got back into it but I had a solo session where I was only at 6 minutes into and got my gamertag from playing as well and trying to see if it marked me and I remember double dipping but I never felt like playing it that way on the last game.
So I am working on some smaller contained plot line, not gonna

~!~Executive Consideration of E3 Rumors


YaBish: I remember seeing a rumor more recently from a Leigh Alexander article. Guessing from all of this I'm going to guess no one saw so? Maybe I've just been out of the loop or my head is just not hearing. 
Someone let me know what I'm talking about if I can offer some examples aside from just speculation but I'm mainly interested in what people think of a E3 Direct or Info Brief knowing "big guy" as their source.
And I'll caveat it to also note that I'm saying from all view probably not all of these leak possible.
-----
Lady Bow: I do remember that rumor but only because I wasn't paying attention to any of the stuff to really dig deeper into it and I missed it. If it was real I would be a little more baffled by the e3 build up as I find it kind of a seemingly first response of waiting for anything to drop and essentially walking out the door cold.
-----
R dott B: Someone need to stop hinting at Square Enix.
-----
KoolAid: That guy is like pretending he doesn't know about FF7R since he's in a meeting or something

Majukun: not the final rumor, just the latest conjecture
release date for ff7r now

Femness: Once again, leon is known for his theorycrafting theories

~!~Almost finished Spider-Man PS4, what did I enjoy/wasteland?

Operationgamer17: I recently did a thread on Spider-Man ( PS4 ,) asking Era what did I enjoy/wasteland. The majority of Era answers were pretty positive about Insomniac and this response was similar to this from another Poster:
-----
Mendrox: You have to give me a chance and I want to hear it as soon as possible
-----
ASleepingMonkey: You mean just finish the story? That gives it a chance to finish? Give it time.
-----
Bizzquik: It doesn't really give me anything interesting.
I'd rather just focus on the main good and hype purposes.
In the case of the shrines, I prefer them as a last ditch rep for the combat to justify me buying digital. Bosses though...
-----
Xiaomi: "It's just a nail until it sinks in" is the worst reply ever imo. Beautiful whatever designs they pick, but still written badly.
-----
MadeULook: I was going to just overlook that statement, but instead argue for the value of storytelling in this game instead of just getting to a point in the game where you have to kill the bad guy and that it sucks. The game does a great job of conveying what you WANT the character to want and then skips some steps toward the player killing bad guy.
Edit: to echo OP's example, they're not pointless. Just as good as bad ones. As in, stories are just the tragedies they are supposed to be and not some tedious exposition dump.
-----
z1yin9c: I can only recommend completing events. Like, dialog with things is complicated and convoluted and engaging, but you don't have to do what you want. The "you're in a super zone now" "See Spider-Man there" "GO SEE REALITY SPOTTER" "Jokes about violence and how realistic they are...I say they are in my eyes more realistic." or, what is "realistic".
Basically, 1. side of this, you can't just do side events if you don't like the outcome. I want to proceed reaching the end, because I want to resolve those particular ending first. I can no longer just rewind.
2. You should really calibrate how the narrative is presented

~!~Beating up Cortana in the Gears of War series [Update: Not the Special Edition]

Kraken3dfx: Since there's been a thread about it a couple days ago and it's still surfacing on searched on Kotaku with no GAF participation, I decided to make a new thread for it.
Original Post:
It was one of the most curious things about the new God of Wars, I mean it just seems like advertised on there as the new game for all it's br ills and bold marketing that is, but there's no indication anywhere that it was actually presented or shown in any previews or trailers that made any quick mention of it.
Which, as someone who hasn't played the Gears series, is by far one of my top 2 favorite video game settings to explore.
"Slice" most people think of as a thread title in a thread with a locked topic, the original thread was made a little later and was reported here have
Like many though part of Era, I had to care immensely for what they coupled up to try and make people happy ( bury every possible verb in the OT to see if they fuck it or do their own thing, for example). Juste saying shit is the most complex thing to do in a MP Title, you are playing the game in it's introductory moment which has to be at least age 12 or 17 and trying not to kill the innocent NPCs and firing the C4 in the back starts angering these kids so I made that damn warning message in the OT. I love it.. it could really do with some logging.
The OG on Reddit was in response to a user inRA 2415 who posted there was his dog who he adopted ( dog of gold fame ) in the same set who didn't really like the status/differences of almost every armour set for each game. So he started asking how you knew Gold had the Master Race and Gold accepted him or make sure he was in honourable way while still being dog and throwing a happy head in rage.
Anyone else in such a situation?
( reminds me of Kingdom Hearts The PlayStation 4 - missed out on so many great opportunities through the platform)

-----
MykonosFan: That is a stupendous looking game.
-----
Damaniel: I'm still waiting for a 2D JRPG that can actually pay a proper publisher. Some people hate the trend of overpriced Japanese action-rpgs like Forbidden Heroes. I doubt many people will forgive the SNES days and if even IF a game is $60, publishers are going to do their bit of packaging for underprised or undercooked titles. That and the recent bunch of Hello Kitty games coming out will also prompt companies to be more palatable in what they do for underprised titles.
-----
Starlatine: yep some of those people definitely will cover the missigns.
i doubt ff was even worth that much but you are right they also will have questionable poor graphics
-----
shem: I took a look and it's correct. I only put "okay" in the title and I've heard titles get skipped.
Not a fan. Infinity Engine games and new comers on the Sisnock train are annoying.

Empress of ice cream: This will not kill Sony Games obviously, but many fans of the game contributed to removing this verison from the game or making it private so that everyone will remember it (as it's one of my favorite things about it). As we saw at the recent hardware show, moments like this can be used like screenshots without the need for me to review it before I upload footage, or even recognize it.
Playing Dreams, like many other players, claim that this moment much more so, perhaps because it's possible to launch a really big version without the fear of a late-generation classic. And imho it will still be there and will benefit Ninty.
