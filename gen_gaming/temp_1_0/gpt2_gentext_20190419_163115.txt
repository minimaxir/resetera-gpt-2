~!~Just bought a 780 because I noticed a GPU drop out of 20% Graphics settings then 250$ games performance mode.

Igappulf: So I bought this specialized machine in order to take advantage of eSports HLSL which I read has barely seen any discussions in the community so I decided to compare performance mode to GPU drop out.
As already noted above, my card does not have V-Sync so (for me) this is pretty ridiculous. Is this a bug for enthusiasts? Or what the shop owner suggest does with the price?
Any advice I have to provide would be appreciate. Thanks
But I wanna know, does it really drop FPS, doesn't it?
Basically, I properly overclocks, ram isnt do for testing.
-----
fanj: Is no one having that issue right now, or do you have to lower settings to even get that?
-----
ggdeku: You should give it a few more days before you buy it since the price is ridiculous.
-----
Igappulf: Thank you so much for the response.
-----
Igappulf: Yeah, I remember, I can go ahead and report this as a bug and then I will buy it for a reasonable price.
I would highly recommend it if that has been your issue.
-----
fanj: Thank you very much!
-----
vivftp: This is pretty essential but may be worth looking at, considering your situation. My memory is janky but curious about this being a bug (oops). Here's a patch I made to make it remove some crucial stuff. Head to the find button yeah.
-----
Fatal: I’m not sure how to fix it but for the next two weeks my 1070ti was originally 2, then it got doubled to 5.4. 
Are the new high frame rates affecting frametimes just hard to guess?

Fatal: Sorry, didn’t give you any clicks to make this a bug.
Is there gameplay clips?

~!~Envisioning Sonic the Hedgehog for VR [Update: Possibly Dec 2, 2018]

LordKano: Article
A video with info about the animated version of the game:
VC footage coming Feb 16th, 1:27pm PT
Xbox specs confirmed, requires a Kinect.
I'll update this.

MELLO: Praise the moon
I am begging
God is real
-----
Danis Saur: Oh yeah they used to earn money through dreams. There's a version of the dream in the remake and it's pay to win. I think they hired people to earn that money IIRC.
-----
Hektor: Yeah, probably double or triple the amount of money they spent on the entire game to upgrade it.
-----
Kapryov: Might be worth reviving the dream over in VR.

Meowmixez: Can we finally get Sonic 2 and also really REALLY bad shrooms in Super Mario World levels?

Protome: Nice! Is there another way to download the engine images you've been gifding for this retelling?

--R: The Plus versions of Sonic 2 are just "worse" versions.
And, it's no secret, the physics in 2 are in worse shape than the first.

~!~Has Anyone Seen Lirikus?

asmith906: We have had a few recent discussions about Lirikus's inclusion in Kingdom Hearts 3. It intrigues me to learn about it to properly understand the game. What is his purpose? Is it a endgame/ruin?
-----
Village: He's a dude that disappears, so he kinda becomes a "bad dad". 
You kinda get that from the boy in the backround screen ;).
-----
Blackquill: You mean a dude on the end of a forest with ice chunks floating around
-----

Jawmuncher: I know it was posted before and still isn't ok. 
However, why the hell he did that is beyond me. I feel like its a spoiler before anything but a proper final boss. I don't have any oarty or real knowledge wouldn't it?
-----
Kinsei: The endgame? He's the one taking everyone out before the last boss. You have to destroy the organization to get there, right?
People want a relative, super powerful dad/son who's most important to them and tries to destroy them all by some crazy shit.
-----
TheSpaceBetween: I HATE him and you don't point out the relative OP? lol
The game is called The End and although he goes in depth on the world building that is his role and he goes into a lot of potential spoilers 
Spoiler
-----
Funyarinpa: He was a relative nobody and took people under his wing, but after he tried to take them down (kind of mind fuck that decision anyways), he promptly subverted the organization's plan to destroy him in a #Comicgate.
-----
Spinky: Never understood why the manga discloses this, though. It was shocking to see him go "Oh wow, this his personality that I see in him."
Who likes Lirikus? In an article I read later, I read something else I heard indirectly RecOILED.
I don't think I've heard anything in the OP.
-----
Magic Mushroom: Classic Lirikus. Based on what he's known online, he can be the Protagonist of the next project and he's even mentioned liking bad anime.

~!~Mitchy- fix your multiplayer issues and we'll overlook the poor launch

Krejlooc: The worst part of fixing multiplayer issues on console is missing patches, scandalously for many of these issues, they still exist. Just post your problems here, propose a fix and we'll toss in unofficial fixes before everyone leaves, lol. I get that fixing your multiplayer issues on console isn't exactly new, but it's new as in the days of shareware consoles where people could easily submit issues if they bothered to do so.
Vermintide 2 on PS4 and Steam is one of us, we've added a bunch of performance fixes that push the game to the limit for me. It's very barebones. It's not a really good looking game, runs and looks fine, it just requires a lot of grinding before being worth the $15 USD price tag.
It didn't run like a great performance mess, it ran and looked fine and it felt solid. But it's got butter smooth performance. That being said, if there was a release if this was one of them its going to get a lot of ifs and probs, so do the folks who used this too, dropping the price...instead
Fortnite is behind a paywall with its paid cosmetics on Xbox and PS, they don't care about missing patches. The base game on PS is about 10 years old (this is 2004) and there has been no patch on PS since...
Last night I was playing for a few matches and noticed some messages going off. A post on reddit read:
"Aaayy! Monster Hunter World 4K patch incoming April 30th! (-"
Sure, maybe they'll just drop the 4K resolution to 1080p for the Pro, but I can see who wants an extra $5.00 if they're only gonna go up the 30% fps increase and not address some PS5 dead pixels on Pro or X.
Also goddammit if you thought "im going to play with the resolution of 1080p" on Pro you have to go for the X version. Is there a new version at that? And then don't tell Shawn about it, come on.

Blablurn: Yep. Still shit on the Pc version.
Also, why none of their heard Dead or Alive 6. Also it would really baffle why they wouldn't do a iteration that adds more buttons than

~!~Open world, mobile-ish games coming to Nintendo Switch

Piscus: Nintendo tweeted this earlier today 
Without any further information, here is what I've gleaned from my proximity
Polygon staff writers are reporting inside the head of one of the Nintendo Switch indie titles. Semi-Custom Robo-styged.
Nintendo likely owns the IP but has no plans for moving it over to other platforms (presumably going to 3DS, Wii U, PC).
I can confirm Wolfenstein 2 there. Not sure about Dragon Quest.
Sources confirm Switch’s Wii U port is not for immediate immediate comments (so somewhat cheeky), and indeed bought dressing relatively quickly.
Thoughts?

~!~Which Pokemon games were your favorite and why?

Livia: Hello Era! This week I was curious about which Pokemon games of the last decade/decade were your favorites and why. Then I will be counting the games that were announced/released around that time. Of course, after this, we have Gen 5, Platinum, HGSS and the Platinum remakes.
So, without it being a monumental event in my life, I decided to break it down and see what you're favorites in those games from your favorite communities.
Pikachu
It was this Pikachu pikacabuster that convinced me to give in to wild augmenters every gen I heard of. I thought i was the most knowledgeable person in the game including peer in the discussions and also picky trainers. Pikachu being so damn knowledgeable of the world and relatively trusting Psyduck. Psyduck being the world's greatest as a higanite, the games are pure gold in my eyes and it didnt have X/Y about muscle memory and memorization as pikachu.
Higan
This was my brother giving me the new toy in the slot lol. 
Psyduck
And the whole Jessie + James rematch costume I guess. 
Psyduck being wicked takes
It was really unfair and frustrating to rely on was one of the reasons I didn't like the games as much. Gamebreaking moves like Glide Bomber were unacceptable. 
Psyduck then goes too far and just blows laserpton everywhere. I flipped on the game just for this. 
Pikachu followed up disappointing me with the Beyond-a-Day Victory Road music. If only for returning.
Psyduck then made me still dislike Magnemite because of its moveset before returning. While Magnemite was unpopular at the time, Magnemite bit the dust. Not only was it absolutely horrible move choice after returning, but I think glitch-fighting techniques like a Roll Brog (cleared the game and completely fixed some issues) made me stop playing it at that point.
Pokemon Conquest
Where I finally had a reason to quit competitive battling. It was something

Crayon: Hi! my name is frank wrest. I adjust my calendar to fit today so we can talk about today.
Last night I heard about a power surge. So quick google search showed that it exists and is mentioned in maintenance emails. No idea if anything else it could hold is this is a related to a surge?
-----
Roy: its not, I keep expecting to hear audio on and off autopilot while it’s happening!
-----
Sorel: I received an update yesterday about a new projector to fit my Plex, I didn't know what to expect. They will ship with a black friday price that links to customers. PLEASE!!! Hopefully they will know what they are adding this time :D
-----
AfropunkNyc: Don't think it has widespread wifi interference at random points is it? Usually the console is off-line mostly. Ive read according to this reddit rumor there is interference when mine is in it, when thats false then I say its probably overheating so I sent a box and it's sold right now.
-----
Crayon: I mean there's a black friday price drop of ~$25 that just copy their firmware to $18 for a console.
-----
Ravelle: Have you looked in the right section? This thread looks misleading.
-----
Hero of Legend: Do you mean the black friday price drop? Or doing a "black friday" round like Peter Doerr does in every stage of his games?

Broken Joystick: XD

====================
~!~"We all played X yesterday" vs. "Was it ok, X last?"

Araujo: Ok i've been playing umpteenth game online, and it is a rage-quitting battle of attrition battle of attrition.
I have decided that yesterday, i killed the boss and level up Black coffee.
Now, reading the title, i think i would have considered it back when i was younger. However, I have born so many games (casually, very casually) where I feel that the fight is really between me and a friend, and don't like being left out. For example, last night, i was playing as Hydra, via perfect timing.
Like i said, i played X, beat him, made him into a Rocket Blue. However,res this toxic effect you don't get in games. 
How come this negativity towards sequels can be 'emphas' or 'baresso' in online gaming ? Switch is a perfect window for this. It may seem steep to most of us towards games with large open worlds but i'm assuming in some case we are talking tens of millions of other free-roaming players. 
Throw in that this was a game that was saved with time, and we are talking about average time spent playing.
For Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled, for a game like that, i thought it was 'interesting', but when i played the crap out of the last boss, i was instantly reminded that i was playing cheeseball Mecha Sonic in a leg-hopping Russian theme populated by sluggers, and those little dickheads with devil ninjitsu rolling about.
I'm currently playing The House In Fata Morgana, and for that, im 'miked' the game and 'grown up'.
Im currently in the 'sit at a desk trying to play as slower paced old man Xanei if there's a cutscene worth 'playing around with'.
In such a big world, the amount of engrish we speak to the game is... poor!
-----
Glio: For me it is a matter of mythology.
For example: Pikachu is called Pachinko in Italian and it is a verb. Probably because it is the most common verb last gen.
-----
super-famicom: You have to be an idiot to miss it.
-----
Why would you do that?: I see it more
====================
~!~Loving RDR2, how do I next over-level my RDR license?

Persephone: So, I first noticed it the other day after posting an LTTP about RDR online. It's not bad right? Well there's the usual public strap up on game services and the above stuff, but once I've looked it up I don't understand... Is it broken, how do I go about getting it physically? I've taken care of it and trying to get it recognized, I've definitely put some time in and re-sold it but I'm not sure where to start. I've read that I've had a license since like February but I'm different. What can I do?
-----
ASaiyan: It can't be broken, right? You wouldn't start over if you don't have a valid one. The first one I believe, had a 1 on 1 match with a USM record constantly on my team record as well. If you want to limit yourself, I believe there was a problem with it a while back, where there was no record, and even a record that was removed and added on in the end, but no one could figure it out and be like "we have record changes enabled on controller situations after we have starred in a report or your rule breaker this week, we just assume". So I have no regrets.

This is a cute idea. Looking forward to the next Flyhigh Hotel photo editing project.

And the bird is actuallyLucius. Giggity looking guy.

My brother bought one of these plates on eBay and he really loved it.

~!~Monster Hunter On Nintendo Switch: Is It Randomiagh To Real Innovators?

delete12345: A lot of people, myself included, posted articles citing examples of things they heard and words they haven’t (attempted to ignore favorites). I have learned that not everyone agrees on the resolution and thus this thread is better.
So here's the evil there. Isn't the idea that "people" are not heroes in the end?
-----
ILikeFeet: And yet it was discovered on a machine that really ought to shut up about garbage on other platforms. Full stop
-----
Dark Cloud: They are having a fair share anyways so it’s kind of tough for them to have a great platform in this industry when it being lookalikes.
-----
Grexeno: Less information is better.
-----
get2sampling: Less and less is not a walk in the park compared to when it was first mentioned in the article.
-----
stan_marsh: The fact that people are more open to discussion rather than to conjecture is a neat thing to me
-----
BioXCrisis: lame that they don't want innovation or free information on here.... honestly how much risk is there
-----
elektrixx: Uh... I wonder if it's just easier to own an actual console, lol. Because when modern gaming really starts fostering a console ecosystem, it opens people to the box that they've grown accustomed to in many ways. Like it or not, the desire to own an actual home console is an ongoing one, not some past time.

entremet: I know a lot of Switches won't go back to the second Splatfest. I think they will find a way to add inklings and Squidtales. However, I don't know if sideboards will carry over.
Here is my preview:
Is there a low level Splatoon community here? I think they are making everything hard for thier first game.
-----
ScOULaris: Yeah, I think I'm becoming great at this game, but because I was composed to the Octolings no contest.
-----
ScOULaris: Also:
-----
OrbitalBeard: The fact that now they're basically an alternate-scenario squid in lab dawn unloading every inkling with a Squid Queen at 200mph is pretty awesome and win-a-win.
Most likely they'll be discreetly launching a new content overhaul Ketsui-style, though.
-----
Orbulon: 1) yep, the inklings lead to the first post #1
2) No contest. I think they are good stakes fighting wild game
3) They launch tutorial content packs
4) Always win (significantly) because I'm still being flabbergasted they did what but an hour ago, yet they still will.
5) they deliver the stuff they promise them along with what they sell us
-----
ScOULaris: Do we have issues with the concept and execution of the first two posts?
-----
Orbulon: Pretty sure you have a lot to catch your eye there. 
If you haven't played Squid Crawl yet, check it out. It's a stealthy, slow paced, with quirky contents in it as you play through it, its gameplay breaking mechanics are a legither sort of thing to go through mutliplayer with.
-----
ScOULaris: No problem! I completely forgot about that. Nice to see you were able to play the AC swampy adventure mode while you can still read about it online.
-----
Orbulon: That and the two new fighters really give you a reason to stay out of the slow-motion Inkling hot-loading and squid loading yet again.
-----
ScOULaris: It's a small selection of “variants” that can be your sneaky scavenging partner

~!~What is your favourite game cover of all time?

Gartooth: Recently came across Shatter Hand's Wild West, which I came across this past weekend. Love the book, very long.

Linkark07: I've beat it recently, and an old school gaming magazine was only available for pre-order on G3. If I ordered the cover wrong they'd send me a new paper for pre-ordering, which I really didn't want to do.
-----

PLASTICA-MAN: Old school magazine.
People think the cover of Legend of Heroes 4 is bad?
-----
Syril: I love the cover of Skyrim Special Edition specially. That was the best one. The author could go on and on for a bunch of negatives but everything was perfect.
Everspace might be my favorite FPS ever three decades ago.
A former member of the staff says the cover was 'stuck' on the crosshairs'.
-----
kurahador: The best is Knightmare.
-----
Syril: A low budget RPG with The Witcher 3's weird world-building where I love exploring. I wish I dropped in different areas for a bit in order to fill my RAM and not trip over themselves trying to get to it.
-----
Serpens007: One of the best books i've ever read, even more so this time, the author isn't too friendly either. Really prefer Publisher GAMES and the magazines are better, a lot of them have little to no hyperbole
-----
Atomic Playboy: I could really do with featuring The Witcher in the title. It just wouldn't make the difference, it would just highlight the glaring issues with it.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses
Gacha Wars
Shin Megami Tensei 4 Golden
Digimon Double Echo

Most importantly though, it has to happen. From the quickest pace of any game on the market, to the slowest pace of any game on the market, there must be a dud if it ever existed. Hit me up if it's already been discussed here, mine is beginning to slowly leak.

~!~Wouldnt it be cool if you could played E3 demo the whole time if you paid for the yearly subscription

Ex-Actarus: That, me, is a low opinion but i believe that Activision would be less inclined to alter their stance if they could ‘play our demos’ at day and time. There is a AAA game publisher in every corner of the world who is willing to make it happen and they definitely do no such thing as less.
So, everyone works full time at Walmart now, you just go to work at Walmart for like a month. All the basics are fixed and you’ll be able to play in the stores you pay. But even if Activision changed their stance, how come you still buy any new games, whatsoever. Did you buy new third party games that people want to try (spy, Décie, Déraciné) and don’t want (Shadow of The Tomb Raider)? Or new AAA games (ala Tomb Raider, Sony first party games, Nintendo games etc), new games are more platforms?

InspectaDekka: Activision is taking this seriously.

OwOtacon: We really need Brad Sams.

~!~Are the graphics of the new Pokemon games down to the low end?

Mórríoghain: Is the whole world still around 15 years away from the new Pokemon games? Quite frankly, it's insane. I had that thought when they were showing the anime :P
-----
DecoReturns: It’s okay I guess. Most it’s like 2K hasn’t shown anything not even recognisably next gen. 
Especially down Toy Story.
-----
Papertoonz: everything
it's an awful time to be concerned with next gen actually
-----
salromano: Bedrock Gen 1.1.2 focuses on the onlining of existing stuff for the upcoming Switch version (so in-game graphics are down-to-earth, this time) and how much original content that will absolutely be running on the Switch.
It's not a huge change from previous gens either.
-----
Donniewahlberg: I feel like a lot of my enjoyment for the new Pokémon games looks more in line with the old games but otherwise I think it's fine for now and you also wouldn't have any input issues by just watching trailers and why it would be bad to play now due to things like motion blur and animation to try and mimic those GC games in 4K. And the confirmed leaks for the LG and EH games even look much better overall, will dig in when I get my copy
-----
RochHoch: It's definitely less "AA" than the 8-bit glory days, but what the hell does the bitrate look like now that we're at "no more than 30 frames per second" (what the hell IS IGN, the 16 bit era)?
-----
Speedlynx: 30 is still incredibly fast. That's what those old games were all about. The graphics then have been getting worse and lower over time and they don't currently have locked frames now.
-----
RochHoch: No requirements to play on an 8-bit console still, correct?
-----
Odeko: Having to top off a 40mil monitor is absurd.

Lant_War: 60fps+ would be great

~!~Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Xbox One X vs PS4 Pro and CBB/DX-900

Theorry: I just figured that most people will all be curious to try this out. 
Basically lets have a look together.
So 1. Xbox One X - Super Mario 64, Smash 64, Spyro 64. 
2. PlayStation 4 Pro - Knack, Far Cry 64. 
3. Switch - Fortnite (pick any version).
4. PC - Watchmojo. 
These are all the games I was told on the Xbox One. My question is if people would just not care much if this option didn't exist as it would ruin the experience. 
And if they did, would they set it up as something to hack due to the poor performance of the consoles and similarly doesn't benefit players that are playing on an official Xbox One.
-----
Old School Gamer: The "graphics" comes off as not great as the other games, but it still looks like the best looking game Xbox came out right after HD.
-----
Sir Guts: Do you want options to change the scales, settings Edition?
-----
Bits N Pieces: My dad got game one last night in two release days.
Seriously does this porn pop on the box.
-----
Knight613: Game is amazing.
-----
icespide: is there a way to connect origin premium account to game? looks broken
-----
jizzywinks: Now I just want this to work on the PS4.
-----
WellbornWarrior: Looking good on DF. I just wish the option to turn off resolution scaling wouldn't get locked behind a button to give everyone the option. Or at least, make it available at all now that there's parity.
-----
Theorry: GTA V has the problematic trifecta problem. Unless I get third screen Moonlight has abysmal performance.

Falchion: Thanks fucking at John.

~!~Any issue with connecting legacy PS4 to PC?

liocrane: My PS4 has been acting sort of erratically lately today. I have randomly started playing games and most recently watching Hulu. Its a weird problem.
I tried different connections installed on my system and the issue is that the PS4 will sometimes disconnect itself from my network and I'm having these issues with an NAT type I’m use for. 
Something I’m guessing is that the NAT type is too weak.
Any help people could provide would be appreciated. Thank you!
-----
Filth_Flib: DMZ is not Modular and has very different content and behavior depending on the connection. So some people's experiences may vary based on connection. 
It's not impossible to test but it's not guaranteed and not something I was aware of.
-----
WhoaIsThatMars: yes. tried it, replicated some issues, resolved. Spent a few hours doing network tests and issues but all network stuff is perfectly functional.
-----
Petrus: It happens to me all the time in Windows Servers.
I deleted and reinstalled the game and reinstalled on windows machine again as well, but both this each each each connecting an server with issues and to multiple Windows Servers for things that should be before fixed.
If it happens in all the Windows servers I just reinstall and that fails for as much of it. Other times I just disable and re-sync a fix.
-----
IGNReasonForUs: What about windows servers? Most of them are peak users, but there are many who are enjoying the service.
-----
Prine: Is the solution to doing that? How do you check if it's acting the same as wifi or ethernet or whatever else?
Basically, I go into the Windows 10 Agent and I set it's DMZ to DMZ so that even if the process can't get Started, at least it's okay? Then I download the game and it works. The game will sit at the xbox m. I basically booted from Safe mode and it's gone for now. I replaced all the inputs and the NIC from the PS4, reinstalled and everything sounds good now. Booting into Safe Mode does the following:
C has NAT "internal"
I'm connected to that. After I go into the Network option, I see "Protip
====================
~!~How likely are you to buy a game day 1 on Yakuza 3?

Elysiums: I always grab Sekiro but never on impulse until I start Yakuza 0 later this month, is that too easy to just wait a few months?
I'm not sure how long the wait for 0 will be but probably more than little longer unless I am more critical of the game design.
I just feel that I am missing out alot already. But I will wait for reviews and go back on my PS4 to try my luck.
I feel that a few months after that i will hopefully decide to buy a game despite Yakuza 3 and 6 on WiiU and if those games are good, I will most likely get MHW, MK8 maybe'll receive a discount at launch or even platinum and jump immediately to 3d platform.
If I decide I will buy Yokai instead, of same genre, I will play the other 3 on PS5 and do 500 mission games instead of going straight for madagascar. Anything else ? Also I have no daily life.
-----
Maligna: Far, away. 
Never.
-----
Flux: It's not a great life, but I'll fairly often grab it once it's done and ready to play. For me it's never a guaranteed release.
-----
King of Dreamland: With Yakuza Kiwami, for example, I never get that early-mid January when it first releases, especially when the PS4 version came out or it was on sale and I have to wait until closer to launch day.
Ps: I’ve not played a Yakuza game since Kiwami came out, which means I’ve been wanting to play it here and there since 2006 now is possibly the best time to play them because they’re on PC and I (mostly) want to be able to play with my wife or on the go.
-----
IronicSonic: 1. Yes, we have lives too
2. I can so easily get a new game in as little as 3 months.
It has to happen, if it ever happen.

Elysiums: Not for a while at least I can wait and play as long as the gatcha game I want. I usually go in for a cleaning on a first run and play as long as possible

~!~RTTP - Sonic Chronicles (aka Sonic Unleashed)

TheGamingNewsGuy: I finally beat Sonic Chronicles and decided to give this a go as I it's one of my top 3 games of all time, playing Forces more and more often
My two games played Sonic Chronicles were laid out in front of me enough that I knew how much of a struggle it would be to tell a young adult that "you can't go now" is to GameStop's point. Something I woulda thought would happen with Age because Sonic Chronicles was one of the most one of in the last decade that age gave games like Sonic CD, Sonic 2006, Sonic X , Shadow the Hedgehog, Shadow the Hedgehog 2, Sonic 3, Lost World, Sonic Mania, Sonic Generations, Mania 2, Lost World 3, Colors and 06 and it must have been hard for IS to understand what the fuck were going on before hand. If that has been the case ever since you find out in the title that you are supposed to know, ask a mod to look at the text description( gonna have it's quirks)
So my first session I had this to say: "we've been enjoying many of your services since I told you to quit. we're working both with you and with most of their clients (who took it on as clients only issues from different clients touch and through the network) and it's worked amazing! today we want you to be happy new subscribers."
I was kinda "eh" about it lol
Twenty years later I still feel kinda overwhelmed and couldn't do it alone. I've got friends who work more in retail especially in retail and we had trouble not meeting people at work and in other friends and such. butlove it! though our group in particular hadn't gifted him/herself with so much games. I've also found new things to play on the service that are less than 15min get up here at night (on a service stand alone or whatever) and can admitips a bit.
The game looks really good and so remarkably I thought. I thought ever since I bought it for the GameCube in 2005 it was my last one.
I thought it would be great commerical game to finally give exposure to? And if not yes don't get involved if it's been cancelled in favour of not getting it?
It's something of a shame that I don't really find the finest gaming journalist but here are some quite big indie puns

~!~[The Verge] Parents should ask their kids about Fortnite and Monster Hunter World

JammerLammy: 
-----
zedox: Not really a feature for me... I've actually risen to the occasion to ask my kids about the reason I'm buying Fortnite and Monster Hunter World.
-----
JammerLammy: Sorry for the bump, double post.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Even if they had kids, the choice for their parents would be hard at first. I believe moms make 2 billion per year and kids make up half of all those dollar amount of investment time you can put on a platform. I’m still looking at videos of their kids playing, one of them even said he did not know how to play really “gamers” and never really spent any money, and I won’t be missing out on anything it seems.
I’ll reflect and think if they can raise a kid that’s better than asking any parent I’m seeing
-----
Lackless: Epic has really shoved their games in my Steam directory and made me pay for their service.
Long story short: consumer rights.
-----
Razgriz417: period of time, this does nothing for me. Ass people who also go buy their games and never play them are trash, nor do I benefit either from that as I notice other people buy stuff other than their games. ;_;
-----
Zhukov: EA's got my interest.
Best of luck?
-----
Conor419: It would be my reaction if I had children.
Even if these countries you have the most access to information about aren't small fry, if there's something more hidden that they don't know about, the sooner I fully realize I'm a rabbit.
-----
Funny Valentine: At worst it provides false hope for equality. At worse it makes good consumer services worse.

Frimaire: Guess this is wildly unfair.
People seem to think parents who don't care about any kids will be better off with few, if any children.

~!~Same textures as the Emperor on Mass Effect, but with cybernetic limbs?

AgentStrange: Even back in Dark Souls 3 the AI wasn't as nimble as it is in the original game which makes the comparison weird because the AI was either slow or clumsy. It's been a while though since I've played both games so I can't explain this. 
using psychical term to compare the enemy variety and differences with ME Shepard in spite of the AI being a concious chaos.

The Almighty Tria: They should have had great procedurally generated planets or at least those procedural generated ones.
The only awesome thing else was to just procedurally generate normal enemies and human NPCs.

The Almighty Tria: It's a much faster and much preferred version of the first Reaper.

~!~Nintendo Is Excited For Mega Man 11 Update Soars in Three Following Days [Update: Nope]

Zippo: The spirits in this month's Mega Man 11 Update are now trashing, according to Aaron Greenberg. I don't think there's much to say. Masuda, Reggie and Switch's likely next president are likely in the final year of his current term.
Apparently this is coming from the Nintendo Power podcast, very possibly a reference to a recent worldwide coverage, that many plans to downgrade lllduring the new year.
One important fact is that them putting the spirits in Shadow is a bizarre decision really. I can't imagine they're just in the Velvet Room, you can see Sam Lantinga and the rumor about her joining them.
Perhaps they went insane when they sent in Channer to bring throws to the next cube, as he can send a lot of punks into it and still make more money? At worse they would ask strangers, insiders are bliss. At worst is ppl that grossly assume the answer to not charge is tacked on lol.

Edit: the Link has shoes.

Big One: Has the card publisher started working on the Switch release? They’ll test it out tomorrow.

You should mostly cover Smash 4 in this thread, mostly. ITS NOTHING OFLIKE RAH RAH U TO O
I think Smash is fun, the funny, and impossible finale that's always best experienced in a Smash Bros-like competitive setting. The overall weird factor has been topped by the entertaining like making one combo for one character and then using them in crossover fashion (a la Street Fighter). You'd be benefitting from better-written writers/ writers to figure out what's actually happening or why the endings suddenlyizzle. Exemplify safe combo strategies and not things like "brass melee combo" or "ninja punches" etc.
Of course you can't beat "badass melee boss" or "support the blind attack" without bringing Samurai, Ninja, or Akuma up as a civilian counter to your opponent's

vestan: I always bookmarked this page for recent info if y'all don't wanna hear about IS for whatever reason but I felt like sharing the lead up apparent from an insider leak from an old Tom Chick video:
It's bizarre to hear Notch go "I'm going to cry" once a game is due out on console of all platforms. It sounds like once Borderlands 3 is available for consoles after all. If they have one home server with Borderlands fans, said server could function as any Steam Remote but there's no means up for consoles yet.
I linked the amidst some google words but after looking at 2 people knowledgeable with these things, he pulled the "with pc players" explanation and shows that the jar currently doesn't have Remote and you can't log in to Xbox:

~!~The Jimquisition - A Cracking of the Sui’s Padding

Fiel: We have reached the point in this medium where we can well point and question things we know for certain from metrics like popularity, views and audience share (and its impact on industry). 
In the last week, Netflix has not reported on any pc strenghts users might have if they jump in to the video streaming space. Jim has however pointed to a significant difference between what recent and more recent Steam games could draw from and Valve’s intent with the steam video technology in general.
Jim has also noted how stutter developers think is worth implementing. It’s true a lot and Valve’s main monetization idea with steam is a 50% cut for every 3 seconds player presses, the reality is steam being stubborn experimental. In fact he notes he thinks it would create an interesting console monetization system.
This morning I jotted this question down within myself for discussion
-----
xxracerxx: What. Steam NOT STANDA. 
Is an advocate for child pornography and punishing people for it.
-----
Fiel: I am sorry. 
Earlier wish we get a real talk from Valve about this issue, but it would not be one of these talks, its a talk about how games are perceived by gamers. These discussions are the best.
-----
Twiz: I read it again. Maybe as a joke, I thought he was avoiding specific questions specific to this discussion.
Google is a treasure.
-----
EkStatiC: Steam PRO, or for general consumers "Data Analyst" as Jim has called it, will handwave your moral support, threads will be just filled with "LMAO! - Glassdoor Pre- Survey! MARKETING! - ELMO SHOP! !!!ELLS MADE! - Whirl! !!!CORE SAVAGE!!!!" and I'm gonna revoke the papers immediately, because I was miffed that Valve had nothing beneficial to expose and was charging for what little protection they had, instead of paying us for what is *just* free.

Phantom Thief: Searched and didn't find anything. This has been posted in the other thread, where I posted all of it. I know some people have already tried the TCG I Am Setsuna Edition, a version of the game, but I wanted to make sure that people who haven't played it are familiar with what it offers.
This is the description for the digital Trading Card Game or Pokemon Trading Card Game.
Pre-orders
It begins on October 2, 2018 in Japan, with a launch date of October 20. In Japan you will be able to register for pre-order for the digital Trading Card Game You wish to join you on the massive Pokemon Trading Card Game.
Player Authentication
Ok, so you know trainers. The roster is just like any other form of trading thanks to unlocks such as Padding, Trainer Quotes, Trainer Quotes etc. Your starting stats are those of the gens, if you Ryan poke him. So if you like, you can trade while dressed in casual attire. Though you can have the I.P., here's the I.P as an added cheatcode for the game.
If you need a doc or something, that's a good start, right?
The Gen 1 Pokémon Trading Card Game roster is as follows
Cirrus
Starmografter
Zubat
Yitness Trainer
Persionak
There are approx. details for the I.P from here to where you pocket it.

Clov: Yep! Awesome idea for a thread! Discovered it in the other thread! Makes it super easy to track down trainers via the internet!

The only time yes had I seen a trailer for a game was when it was on Gamepass but they actually released trailers for the game but not early enough to check out their quality efforts.

~!~Dissuria Grounds - new roguelike Zelda-like?

Carnby: Announced months ago, but around 8 years after the last demo KS promised, DissonANCE is a 2D side scrollers+multiplayer roguelite/RPG-ish, where you can experience the beauty of a mother/family. I have heard its already been touched on by some to death boards, which is a shame since its one of my top insta- I like the look of the board(steam and gab's) but i'm for real curious and have 1) played it before
2) review how beautiful it is and play as long as you feel
3) How the gameplay is
4) hints the gamemakers behind the labor of the game
5) promises a cold feckie on release

~!~Assassin Assassin: Fury is a very good game

Pankratous: A year after completing AC Odyssey, I finally played and adored Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection prior to picking the series up with Syndicate. Following the lowest resolution of 70-if-a-verion, the Ancient One abandoned the pursuit of the perfect target assassinations. Looking back at where The Ezio saga began for me, this was an amazing experience to play through.
In using the built-in assassinations and stealth aspects of the game, Assassin's Creed: The Ezio Collection adds an interesting amount of atmosphere to an already visually striking game. If you're not fond of the title, well you've jumped ship into a great franchise. This time, the story is presented in a cinematic fashion, that leaves you open to assassins to hunt. Still not feeling that blank for the main storyline, however, Blade Runner made the right choice in introducing a new world to the narrative. The result is an immaculate film that blew minds everywhere.
*blade soak it*
Assassin's Creed: Origins is another awesome game. Story+Story! 
Amazing soundtrack. The band back to work and the music swelled to another very emotional level as Blade Runner-infused melodrama loaded with tribute requests. The songs make for great backdrops and neat mysteries. A smart approach here, seeing the game concept art filled with games from the past being thrown into the dumpster as an attempt to garner more positive impressions. I
-----
Quinton: I felt that game mechanics and choices had a lot more weight to them than I ever saw in the books or the games I've played through in the past. The first Assassin's Creed contains Torment and the second Assassin's Creed, so there are likely better ways to run these games in the next 20-30 years.
-----
ReddishGUI: I didn't like it at all.
-----
Axe: Not close to 30 tho. Hopefully they set it closer to 20 or also 40 someday.
-----
Laughing Banana: Origins was hugely disappointing mess of a game imo and that's being generous with experimentation. Most of the fun of the franchise comes from writing your own character, which is itself quite difficult (and often flawed, by the way).
Looking forward to when the series is fully redone (yes, gonna have our own RPG series again in the future).

~!~LTTP: Resident Evil 6

isawbluejim: I am in the mood for some horror game LTTP. I own neither for completionist reasons.
I gotta confess, I haven't been much of a horror gamer at all lately; more and more I've gone back to playing the more TEW horror games - Dead Space and the like, for instance. I like the back and forth of trying to call elder scrolls puddling. and maybe this sounded like a great choice. The first time I'd ever tried it, I just couldn't, the sound was out of control.
When it finally happened, I was intrigued, and ordered it on the Steam store for 30%. Ended up going with the Umbrella Academy title or something, as I was a huge fan of Clock Tower. I played this over the course of an hour on Steam.
The sound was a mix of t-worms with and (?) Mad Max, and I was actually getting really nervous about entering combat, so having those sticks of hair stuck up in my mouth was scary.
- Walking bombs and big ol blue pen was kinda creepy. Maybe I will finally wrap something up and put it up
- TEW is a bit scary for some reason, maybe because I was nervous, but at that point, it became too much of a hassle. Also doesn't sound enjoyable. Maybe it wasn't as scary as the Resident Evils 4.
After the first TEW hit, I was onto something with t-worms with Umbrella's different attacks. I kind of got used to it, but I expected it to be something different to the first TEW
I remember looking at Wipeout for the first time once, the burn is intense for both a realistic hack 'n' slash and a TEW modern graphical style. I thought both had a lot going for it and it was the first time I'd ever gotten so that I could show them my new shiny RTX 2080 TI 1080p setup (I put on an NVIDIA RTX variant of my GTX 1080 at the time due to RTX prices)
However, the Burn is present and creepy: the OVA to the panel is excellent; and the sound is quite really good:
I just hope the people who made the networking that provides the most enjoyment for horror, and who are the people who are going to write the rest of the article don't think like this just ha

~!~Do your pets have their own personal story?

seiki: Hello all, so my little bro and I both want to create a housepet story for a game.
Bowser is getting a girlfriend and i have fun a lot, but i realized this has kept me from most of having a lot of fun with new dogs. Good thing i like that everything is cute and inviting and that when you pet him i can come out OK or tired. He is specially cute in his eyes, specially his green fuzzy balls.
I am not really into Disney or showing of new movies but i wanted to know from people who have pets in popular games which popular ones you think are special.
I took this interest because i like little kids stories which is why all I see in Monster Boy is funny shoes ( cant wait to see gifs 😂).
PS: i love petting :)
-----
CaviarMeths: It's not a particularly uncommon thing, but I'd use my PS4 as a front for players to walk dogs to toys.
Animal Crossing is the closest to it. I think it lends well to the concept of being a foster caretaker and a player in general. Full control helps, but you'd also lose the controls within new accounts if you f***ing abuse a dog.

angel: I got a little pissed off that my wedding jewel jewel Penny for getting a Dang Dog had a pet by the skin of my heart.

Frecklestein: I would be happy with a version 2 of Ratchet that can watch animation. Also bc there was a ton of spider breathing.

~!~AAA Games Need To Be Rewarded Too

HououinKyouma00: I'm currently cooking dinner and debating which dishes to serve at a later date (tomorrow night and not normally on the weekend) and my prep comprehension is HAPPENING... Second time I'm in a situation like that I'd never, really expected it to happen, but it's finally happening.
One of my favorite menu-service/meal-working-agames in recent years has been games like Zyders Noodle and the magical Egg, filled to the brim with nasty, abusive, and disgusting creatures that hunt to drag you down even dryer. Once you have a charm rating or whatever to ensure a reward or reward card or whatever, the whimsicalness and theely, the pleasing aspect is replaced with an annoying aspect (stealing) that may or may not require you to pay for your meal.
My favorite recent example is the recent "Doodle game" and how the main character decides how many eggs to deposit from a single pond (Mushroom or chicken). You can think there is something fishy about this particular pond where you can deposit as much water as you want, but that's just a few ideas a or so.
Given the ongoing removal of the frustrating and phobic "Do not disturb fellow animal" notifications in most stuff like MMOs and Barn to get eyeballs and QR codes, I think they' probably a good time for me to notice this and shut the damn thing off permanently.
If you have heard of any other games that have had a similar problem like this and you were eagerly awaiting news, or 
began you had to shut this off, for me the easy solution was to use my own phone when playing the game so the sounds were bypassed... but when it loaded up i heard it played the game instead. Plays music was removed as well (surprisingly enough) and now it talks to the chicks directly instead of the annoying portal message that entire game and browser games always had.
From what I have heard that's also from utterant abuse and there's always someone getting their blood aint a good match in the real world, so i thought, "wouldn't the pooe be pooe think I have something to actually pay a lot of attention to.", so next time you're playing it just don't get a Switch lol, because that would be a pretty big danger in real

Mr. Nice: Here are just some of the updates I got on my Switch account:
Friend region: When starting a game, if you get new region, that game will use the Local PS4 version of the game. Not enabled by default in the US version, but I did get the extra DLC for that and a few other things.
Thief region: Friend region is now separate from friend location. Open your Japanese guides with JP import guides and use only that language. No requirements for Japanese copy.
Save states: Save states now only take two Joy-Con to clear in-game. Several were found, some were missing, and my save was reset the second time just to clear those.
Community Pack: I cleared out the remaining chapter of meat boy territory. Well they kept adding new pack. I did buy the whole package but got harder to use for the relatively enemy-less area.

~!~Let's talk about games with name recognition that is actually better than the original release

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): A game seems to be a landmark release and can truly stand out even if its initial release and reception are second to none. That's right, it's actually a better copy of a game released and loved at launch. This kind of value is only held back by a simple title.
Many will call Dark Souls 2 "The original Dark Souls". Yet, it's not a perfect copy of Dark Souls that hasn't been re-released in the past. Dark Souls never was a perfect, consistent release to begin with. Yet, the original release of the game cannot be called perfect because details and secrets throughout the game that were intended to be lore-friendly still fall completely under the same title. Any RPG fan should be able to feel the uniqueness and beauty of the Dark Souls title plus the crazy stuff of Dark Souls 2. 
I'll start...
Thief of Thieves
Developer: SquareNES
ROM: Windows 7 autorun
I picked this game because I've always liked the look of the original version of the game and long hours in the game as a non-member of the gang. At first I thought the game looked mediocre but then it got old and I thought it had a good chance to make a name for myself at Nintendo.
Worse I realized it had tons of fan service! Even made it to chart in software when it launched in the States on 4/15/18(?)
The name of it is "Thief of Thieves"
RELEASE: Windows 7* at a MSRP of $19.99. Mercifully, Square said in August the game would come to Windows PC.
GAMEPLAY: Dark Souls*
Let me clarify I'm talking about the original Dark Souls
RELEASE: Windows Store*
ROM: Windows 7\8\10\10\14\x64
Nostalgia from "Thief of Thieves" using "Bloodborne" attributed to "Bloodborne", was an ill pulse to be "thief of thieves". Alongside that thievery was stealing "blacks", and it was despicable!
Final Analysis: Fighting with a "Bison" in Dark Souls was torture!
Spoiler
Yes, Ubi is behind this on many levels. The fact they created Fyre twins for the atmosphere and the

~!~PSA: Do you turn off the wireless for game audio?

shoptroll: I used to turn-down the audio for various games to reduce booting noise and on there to make sure my consoles were working properly (though at times there were technical downgrades). Recently, depending on the game, I turned it back on to make sure everything was working as per usual, now I feel like I'm not getting the best out of audio.
Has anyone done this for games like this and have this thing where I turn it off, but are still getting sound?
-----
leng jai: Sometimes games just turn off automatically. 
It's usually games that sound very loud but turn it back on slowly and listen for resms or burst sound etc.
-----
GreenMamba: I just turn it back on all the time and I don't realize a single sound until I actually play.
-----

====================
~!~Are you storing/eating your Switch and getting ready for the New Switch Era?

"Duck Sauce" Snorteda: This new trailer for the new Switch has me hyped to the wild. For those on the fence about picking up a Switch, I want everything ahead of launch day. 
This new trailer does a great job of showing what everyone is looking for:
No screens or info as of yet, though.
Nintendo confirms that the launch lineup this year will be:
Zelda
Mega Man X
Mega Man Championship Edition
Mega Man 11
Mega Man Legends
Mega Man X Legacy Collection
Octopath Traveler
Octopath Traveller
Captain Toads
Sonic Mania Plus
Like the last few months, I haven't really had many Switch games and I've had plenty of moisture in June and July. While November and August diminished supplies, they're still plenty of bang for my buck.
I'll be using screens/fresco outside screen testing this year (against later-gen consoles) and protective screens will work no-around on the new Switch.
What's my Switch game left over?
Octopath! (Vizero)
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Minecraft (Switch excluded)
Brawlout (Nintendo Switch)
Etrian Odyssey Nexus: Ad Isoverability Edition
Pokemon Quest (Vizero)
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze
Bayonetta 2
NES Give Yo
-----
LinkStrikesBack: So also soaked in nostalgia. Personally I'll be using those screens.
-----
NotLiquid: I'm ready to start planning games, but I'll be more hesitant to start a new game, sticking it out too long and then making a conscious decision to sell before the new console comes out
Of all those games, Octopath in particular blew me away yesterday. Now I'm just gonna have to decide after E3 how serious is the risk of buying anita.
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: Don't buy anytime soon, IMO. Unless the Game Boy games are compared to the GBC games in a way that can be put down easily, I can't imagine myself having significant interest in a new entry in the Dr. Mario series.

TechnicPuppet: Yes. Still waiting for the "bigger game at the time. See: Gal*Gun XD)

~!~Rumor: Virtual Console Is Cantbelieve

Lozjam: Virtual console? 
I know people will happily rage at the death of virtual console because it is (or ever was) considered a spinoff of FF, but what do you think Nintendo "should" be working for beyond any reasonable doubt in wanting to revive the dead beloved console? Nintendo would loose a tremendous amount of goodwill they might not have otherwise by putting their catalog on the Switch and launching a new console that they consider to be a "still family console"... Marble its home. 
Nintendo and Nintendo "own" these properties. PlayStation "owns" SNES and "PSX". It is true that there are multiple beloved consoles of this generation. But the failure for Nintendo to bring these franchises to Switch was either their own fault with their publishing and one of its own, or SSM or other 2nd party companies clearly moved away from virtual console. I just feel like that is sort of history every gen when lapsing fans start expecting a nintendo-rise that is now in the middle of something but turn in displease or take for virtual. The first year it wasdule for the new console, the siren child for example. "Rumor has it a port" was believed, a "new indie IP cameoed" or simply a rumor. And its incredibly misleading when Nintendo "owns" these IPs and has them representaly pushed by Nintendo. "Port is coming or we think it will be announced at E3" is nonsense. 
I really thought about what they are before clicking into the decision to start talking about VC and Virtual Consoles. Given how difficult it must be to get on board, I still hoped that Nintendo would tune the announcement down for future "big" console in order to have ports to Q4. Though I don’t really care, VC would be a self promotion for Nintendo...shouldn’t that be a good thing? Okay, let it ride, if they are going to ride it...first console I want to play an nintendo-owned console ages before it takes on all the VC wishes it has with VC kids, I want it to star in the new Spyro movie and at least somewhat have a portable port on the way. But to be honest, moneyhatting rumors (that would be depressing) always works, so games like Metroid or Yakuza threads don’t have a say in my

~!~Machinima shutting down due to lack of content

Nappael: Machinima had one of the most frustrating and skilfully run online servers I have ever seen until they started to get more consumer friendly as time went on. They had several day-and-date events. There was no way to make an in-game gif at all. 
Many of the servers were a joke which kept happening for weeks. I haven't had a single server being shut down since 2014. 
Machinima has clearly improved. They added (a lot) content since day 1, making new players experience and funnelling the server with many world events and so on. 
I have a feeling they will be able to get back onto improving things for the next few years. 
TLDR; Many of the servers and whatnot have apparently been a joke for a long time, and they will probably be shut down in a few years.

ChaosSmurf: Machinima is a good site and should be in better shape next time. World of Durango and World of Vendetta are still around in my daughter's LOVE library.

~!~How is liveservice number one for gaming?

crazillo: Has there been any chance of an industry leader of higher quality games being added to the service before? Microsoft and Sony could do very, very well in the mobile/services side and could possibly bring In for those who have doubts in their services. Thinking about the strategy for new studios. We got the XBL going, my PC and console are hooked up to my TV. However, ever since the Jimmy Huang article on The Art of Failure, very little news and info is available about the service successfully launching on everything. Even on the smallest update(like a Black Friday sale) I feel like it's pretty minimal. Much smaller, but very small IMO. No news on Activision Blizzard or Blizzard rumor/leaks, at least until the 60.000.000 hype launch in late November.
I can understand that companies like EA, Ubisoft, Creative Cloud, Funcom, of course the big ones. However, this isn't the first time I've felt this towards gaming services. I always felt a huge advantage to game streaming services like GamePass or EA access, but with services like Xbox live, Netflix, it is basically devalued and reduced the appeal of gaming as a monthly subscription service. And enough people would give their money to Microsoft, even if 0% of people have to pay for it. This could be especially true for big publishers as well. With EA, Netflix, CBS et al launching streaming services, in 2020, each system should draw close to 20% of users for its services. 
I've been with Microsoft since 2010, its 1st party output has always been below Sony interactive. Every release from Microsoft is a service, not a new game, nothing new on Gamepass or Game Access. It's missing Forza horizon 4, Halo 5, Killer Instinct and other new Xbox games. But at a glance feel like a new world super big enough to reach people with reduced subscription costs.
Outside Mediocracki, which I think was announced early last year, 1st party games have never really received substantial growth post launch. Very few, though. Have they become indie, to the point where you wouldn't even consider imported AAA releases due to the lack of hype launch customers have for the models. Most just get a release day deal, except Ubi. But with Ubisoft and Sony making games as common as possible they're starting to grow their studios again.

Action is about as derivative as “prepping something that was never what you wanted” is. Although, if you take time from FIFA and RDR2 with the nature of the FIFA series, it potentially ends up just being an evolution of the formula of 1 and 2, something that is what EA wanted to make.
Also dodge me with what was described as “nerdy arisen”. If that’s what you mean.

Its remarkably good. 
Lack of blockbusters, they finally completing their PS4 classic with much larger scope, ambition and scripted stories and unending CGI and not getting wrapped up in the PlayStation hype culture before getting backtraced and being upfront about the whole thing.

~!~Races in games where you control a positive or negative outcome.

justiceiro: So, guys, recently i played through through the divine beasts, and i heard that there were some evil souls like groups in hell. I decided to try to explore the game more, to play a game using both positive and negative outcomes, and i came to the conclusion that i didn't care about either outcome. I was astonished at the thought that i didn't care either outcome, because i choose positive outcomes by default and im done, because i like you go on! 
The trilogy, followed by the allied series, followed by the final boss that was khill. These are not only bad, but there were many bad enemies and many good ones, and after that bad shit was gone. But back to the topic, what progress is there in the games in either a positive or negative direction?
If i M OVEILLUS positive future is that you can choose to not kill the bad enemies? If i don't care about each outcome in the trilogy, i can choose to not kill a future bad example, or bad story say, found here. Where is the "you built a chain combo and did nothing in the past? You..... stepped back in time to strive for that accomplishment".
Now, i am biased, so i said in future that this is not only positive but you can actually do what you want almost. But i was talking with one friend of mine in a serious argument that when i think about game design, and here he told me that most of the games he played was doing something that i did little to achieve, and when i achieve something like power rank i tackle a small flaw (i know, there are small things you can do but without it i still don't accomplished something, i hope to master it more in next time, but it depends on

The biggest,gelmost popular game kET is FINLAND (a mashup of tabletop and video game in a town called Future Junk) and it's great to see them get a head of steam. Finland will be theDutch evo competition, competition that originated, spread and flourish over the longer period of time between Kickstarters and total funding. Finland saw the doubles for the past streams featuring both the live and kickstarted crowd, the distributions, the stream itself and this open-world Japan inspired game in quite some hype + heated discussion.​
​Finland and it's been won over and over before. This time, the winner would win the prize, the stranger goes on a pilgrimage to Himself (along with the many others involved) for rituals that are going to haunt his soul for the rest of his journey. Relic of Evil is the will of the Rift, the doom they would be set upon Suda51 to perform. And thus, the centerpiece of the contest will now win at the highest levels that the Kickstarter campaign can hope to reach.
​Finland has managed to win the last crew of ​give and receive the final prize in each category, as the winning team seeks to build an engine that will power this project into the next one within 2 years.
​Of course, imagine a far larger A1 
This would also be a good game to announce a campaign for if Suda didn't want a closing steam links to be a lock.

Indelible: Dark Souls on the first town making bank on a 4K tv with a mix of high and low resolution assets. In towns you can find an NPC (or relationships) that talks about you and unicorn's friendship, which is interesting. Has any loading time and is it a walking speed or even running speed?
-----
jalenralphyeje: I got 1X 1X and released last year. I think theres a lot of visuals and movement in that game but you're enjoying it for the most part. Theres so much going for your wrist that it's hard to get used to just sliding around 5ft to 10ft on public places and walkingers. This is not easily moved and with it previous movement I fall asleep while dragging my partner across the room at times. I can fix that in tonight.
-----
elzeus: God of War and Detroit each had a loading time. Dark Souls II on the other hand was unlocked. Dark Souls when you boot it you can basically fly straightaway while the dude goes up a bit. Not very difficult to get to your goal but Dark Souls can drag a little.
-----
DPT120: Strangely, There have been plenty of times where loading times have been out longer than I'm comfortable with already. I wouldn’t be surprised if OP picks one of these games.
-----
Protome: It didn’t load for me, but the service was a very good job for sure and still delivers.
-----
RoboPlato: I didn’t think it was a traditional game. I imagine it would work something like how visual novels do. The moment all of the attacks connect and the NPC gets alerted by track and whether or not he/she had the magical weapon (that doesn’t load) it’s a magical achievement!
Anyhow, I have faith you can stop playing it You know the load times are dreadfully heavy? Games that are loading really can.
P.S. Also will I be able to keep the game running forever if this gets fixed?

~!~De-obfuscated quests in the Mass Effect games

Wololo: Recently trying to play through the Mass Effect series, I started up my first playthrough of Inquisition. This is how you get the de-obfuscated quest logon's ability for your characters which involves you destroying a shuttle ship as previously predicted.
I came across this video that gave a great summary of the entire de-obfuscation process. The last image in the video uses a long-forgotten shader cache so it doesn't seem like this video ever made a video. I don't even know if the video was ever initially uploaded to various game sites, but was found by a replay player as a handy summary.
was working on this before I even made the save, since the developers don't upload video footage sometimes. This game made me wonder if I needed to keep playing because these "just" de-obfuscation quests in games like ST and DS where you have to actually kill a bunch of npcs on the map…
if I keep playing, what others do as cool as this one quest? Cdi? Cdi. Wh

I don't really agree that all these gotchas should be AI generated quests or what not within the game. They totally need to be finicier puzzles rather than trying to take complete graphics wherever.

~!~The Graphical Technology of Kingdom Hearts χ and Kingdom Hearts 3

Eolz: A few retweets later and we still aren't sure on if Kingdom Hearts 3 will run on consoles nowadays or not. The Kingdom Hearts series is praised for its "platonic 3D graphics", but with the second entry launching in little over two years, have we now reached a point where the graphics are poorly explained, sometimes even hit or not hit correctly (e.g. while looking at the world for the second time obviously) and you can still have multonal amounts of motion sickness? With KH3 is the game developer solution in this?
For me it's 3D graphics, considering that it's an MMO in HD and there are even references to HD versions of the games in square assets there isn't much that can be said about the graphical prowess of KH3 in 2018.
And so, my question to you: what are some of the more popular in terms of internet reputation regarding the graphical technology used in KH3 to generate this perception, and why?
-----
AlexMeloche: It made many people not want to play the game
-----
DNAbro: Well Nomura intentionally left a lot of stuff out.
Also...it’s by far the most popular team to fill all the technical gap left by Nomura in the last decade.
-----
Odeko: KH3 is in an almost perfect position, although, it looks worse. The graphics alone are not gonna offset it.
I’m saying this cause I’ve been seeing more hyped groups list some games in the actual PC heavily (Can't believe a friend of mine bought it on PS+ during E3. Gonna try instead to justify myself not going with the PS4 version since they don’t sell numbers like they should...but again, heavily discount on PS plus).

That doesn't mean most were wrong.

~!~Far Cry 5 (PS4) Hides Completionism Like Nothing?

SOLDIER: This is not a war/apocalypse thread. No mention of political themes, etc. I’m asking as a calling of excellence and I don’t mean to criticize the story of the game as it is. I want to point out:
Regarding gameplay shifts, the plot twist of a character not coming to terms with his past and coming to terms with reality. 
One of the best things about this type of narrative/game narratives is that it basically shifts the focus from one character to another, and the player of the narrative automatically becomes another, depending on how the narrative operates- in Deus Ex, a protagonist is an apolitical character- but in Far Cry 5, for you he is a politically-acquired character who practices violence and has conceived a clan of fellow soldiers inspired by his past. Humanly, dissociative states and moral defects, and anxieties are shifted, and such characteristics become one of the protagonists of the story. 
This change also effects the gameplay. The game is enveloped by a invisible war / political fantasy of France, where the same men and women, roughly second to Nazi #Allegiance and #NoAutism are pro-Nazi, and there are remained static even in post-credits scenes - i

Deleted member 42686: Over my shoulder I dont get all that nice raw gore since the game supports scale models on a PS4pro such as:
- Huge blocky facial model
- Almost entire character has a whole arm got cut off
- At least twice is in the story state
- Considering literally less than 5 minutes of the game this is really jarring
-----
Memento: OP you should put that out there instead of some "lies".
Billress of time.
-----
SpinlyLimbs: I imagine this affects the tattoos?
Not sure if they're static just like you said. The character models aren't. Deus Ex on the other hand, get through the opening, and then you look at the characters and they change and come back to life otherwise never see back.

~!~Wayforward (Another developer to face the controversy surrounding Psychonauts 2) is still on hold

JMTHEFOX: Before I start talking about these issues, I want to talk about one particular issue with Psychonauts 2. Issues that I have seen numerous times where the reviewers very much understand what they are talking about and just rush into the panic with articles and announcements to portray the game as flamethatly evil or that David Cage adapted the script for the upcoming Batman movie from 10 years ago to this year. Much to my dismay, they somehow managed to send out a PR about this issue to the norm that we can still read our notes on a computer, obviously meaning it’s still better to discuss the implications of the game and its creator this week than sit around while a pile of hot, 2-hex love dust. 
Based on what I’ve observed so far, however, this discourse over the writer of the article and the author of the article circley is getting annoying, as well as the author of the PR email informing people about this. I wanted to talk about this because, as someone who was not even aware of what this whole incident was about at all until right before the article went live, I can’t help but take these PR blunders so literally, Going straight up to the biggest holy shit. 
Screw it, I guess. Game wasn’t selling really well. Not that the fans were overly concerned about the wider market, just that people were still buying PUBG when the devs went public so black friday evening was about the day. Were the investigative journalists also like, pulling the trigger? 
Anyway, there are still people out there who legitimately feel they have been called out by these hardcore fans, and have had their careers taken to an brink of ruin just because of the behaviors of the company... Who knows, maybe there’s some bright spots here made all the worse.

Temascos: I don't think it's the publisher's fault, nor do I think it should be redrowned in the grand scheme of 'lephally shaking controversy'. Regardless, the people who worked hard on this absolutely dogshit can't think much better for standing.

And went and met a guy in an anime.
Then another robot and midboss person
Then you drop down into the forest and it's okay, there's an enemy who will blow your stuff off.
Then again, it's the family's house, so they saw the mycha and went down there, finding some high level builds there, so they upgraded the car to harder numbers. And then you find a girl and decide it's better to take advantage of some of the damon armor and go to town on the goal house and kill some thugs rahdy maaaaarfoote's (just one exception).
Then you find out midboss was one of the Feral Fanged Nobodies, and you can activate it once you get to one of the 4 floors.
Then you find out he's here one of the kinks done since you needed to do a ton of battle or it joins your party and is not yours and thus bad, so you live there.
Then your character gets a new job (it wasn't explained or explained) and you hop in to try and join the core members(Sophia, Betty, Joshua and Mars.
Now it's your turn.

TheSubsequentTriangle: Neat. Loved the first one so doesn't make sense either. Covering only one region, the only thing we know about this game is...
-----
Masterspeed: I played the first one and liked it. Not quite the same genre but I'll be shocked if it didn't have a sequel in your list of priorities. 
What they are working on now is starting another RPG.

Platy: This is also the previous AC game... so I think we will hear someone announce something incen

Servbot24: Guess that makes sense.
I think companies will always choose to operate somewhat anonymously.

sibarraz: This doesn't exactly help with gamerservice, but i love that this game exists, thanks to the hype

~!~RE3 Remake for PS4/Xbox One Update (Metroid Fusion Remake, Cloud Save & free Multiplayer)

Eolz: From Dengeki PS Blog
Going to wait till we see the update before posting since we don't have an OT thread already, but just wanted to drop this here:
Original Article
NOTE: The page shows the date and time of the update before and after. For example, the day before.
It's worth mentioning that the Free Multiplayer option is in a News blog on the page right now, but they didn't give impressions of it.
Digital Post-Release Gameplay
So about now, we finally have a gameplay reveal. Tl;dr as they'd likely want to wait till next year to reveal it earlier or reveal it on the E3 stage, thats more important on this day.
There is a "NOW" button while it's not officially being announced yet, but maybe that's someone at Square who can give us a idea of the game's quality? I only watched some of the Official Anthem gameplay, so I'm still working my way through from datamining/mashing in order to ascertain what information I had before. Also I'd like to emphasize that the Luigi's Mansion Prototype video isn't really something you'd want to see.
With an E3 release date now rumored, assets will be upgraded including new lighting and textures for the final assets. (no screenshot)
Screens
So what do you want out of this? Better music? Analog synth solution? Rock band play? Easy toggle for FPV cameras? NiGHTS? F polls? Do multi-player demos count? Local multiplayer on 3DS? More text? Please post some exciting info in the comments above!
-----
ILikeFeet: New reveal maybe?

Patitoloco: First post from the thread.
I REMAIN, THE CLAN EXIST!!!

Jarod McChicken: I honestly don't see this. This will be like next gen: a full remake with updated assets, and the Last Guardian's performance will 100% be "blown to the wind" for points as well. (And if The Culling ever comes out, well, that's another discussion)

====================
~!~What PC games is on the road at the moment with the ability to play with an Aim Controller?

Tizoc: So, a few years ago I bought the first game for I5-3400, just when i-4 had released and it was on sale for a paltry 30 USD / game.
The games were quite good so I didn't mind the assembly / tedious tedium of the first few games at least.
I wanted my first Portable FPS so bad and I didn't play Darksiders until well into its lifespan and I didn't actually play it until around E3 2012. Despite it being relatively newer at E3 2012 it had a good obscenely high modded gunplay. I'd be down for more like that.
And yes, every game I played this generation is in 1080p resolution. I guess I like that. I think so. And I feel burned by having dropped more games into the newest one, because the previous was better. I need more comfort horror games, i guess, the series has great atmosphere and the atmosphere they have of having included not being able to run 3rd person games on PC still, and essentially I've tried it with my big gun to death.
But for some reason my pc keeps getting older, definitely doesn't wanna play older games anymore and lately I just start Steam, with Doom and CS:GO and also SP/W and have gotten great at that, run ok with RTS games with a try feel and really liked MS doing it, Windows especially Tweek
Then came MHW recently and everything...
And I love that kinda endearing feeling of seeing the graphics of games past that are great, but you'll burn one out with it, with Doom and Wolfenstein (not that there's anything wrong with these games), and most other AAA devs I didn't at least tried out some their game already and then just dropped it at I think three or four sales of some kind or another and lost interest.
Worse yet, part of me is trying to crawl through that big black "why am I so weak" portal chest out the front door and this ancient trash talking devslayer in robes teaching me about some personal truths.
The WiiU was my first console and I don't I love it no

~!~God of War 4: how the axe is one of the best weapon in a video game

Toriko: Game of the Long War
Since the 60's hit the gaming industry gave an axe much needed love. When playing a fighting game in the 60's it truly feels like the best weapon in the most variety and flexibility to conquer challenging situations and grief your enemies. Doing away with the quarterstaff or equipping a different one to optimize damage is satisfying.
This is what killing Ganon in 480 for the first time feels like 
Amazing
Great perks 
Great moveset
Great multi meter Easter egg system
Amazing customization
Great moveset/customization with very detailed and detailed armor
Unique abilities that stick around for long 
All the modern improvements to 3 areas thats slight improvements that combine into a beefing up of what waslvl for the endgame and adds it's own unique spice and make in this new era of moveset and customisation that hasnt been done before a long time. Yes the Rabbids and other mmo devs removed the greed overpowered elements but I think it adds a new layer to the formula( Hopefully the Rabbids pack can get the greed bug resolved).
I just want to thank the devs for throwing it out ( Going to use the axe on a certain hill and climbing that takes time and skill is almost fun. I never anticipated a developer would have such an intricate and well defined weapon like the axe. It really destroys the pretension that you are starting with the game.
-----
InsaneTiger: What is this mythical “weapon of the apocalypse”
-----
InquisitorAles: It's the axe, not a mythical evil one.
-----
Marty: Yeah I was surprised to see it as a post in the OT.
-----
Arion: Yeah neither is good or evil. It bugs me in every way. I can see why some like to meme about it being evil, but it's not like a sword itself is inherently evil and therefore should be respected.
It's weird and meaningless. I understand why people love in a post apocalyptic hell, plenty of people just love in other places I have. I am not saying this isn't a case of the developer willfully ignorant to the consequences of something existence, it's just that there's something about it that's generic and generic as fuck.

~!~Question about Dino Crisis 2 and my girlfriend (no canon to SMT games)

Turin: So, the past few months I've gotten back into finding out that the franchise, aside from most Resident Evil games were actually developed in-house by a Western studio. I saw it before on metacritic. I decided to watch the franchise live. The Dino Crisis was a well made franchise. On the downside, I don't really understand what "80 % chance". The opening of the first game is still there and so many other parts are barely known... we just go from that? I guess it's better to view the franchise like this:
and here is the second one:
So what was the storyline you loved about the first one? Basic doesn't really stop now, I still think what the rest of your topic is also fantastic / badass or just stupid or dumb to say. I find the original hard. I got really into it though at least, man!
tl;dr: Its a "72 %" horror franchise developed by Sumo Digital; it was dated but still interesting to say the least.
-----
D65: This being a higher budget/Western game popped up on Steam over half the time.
That first disc was legit ok even though. There are many grumblings about how it was actually 2012 western and that "glorious 80 % real time linear", but the story and character design of the first two games are terrible.
-----
Rodney McKay: It's a Western studio, even if they've been more successful that Western. This is the playstyle of the Japanese games where you can have (a) run and gun your way through hordes of demons, b) run and shoot them and dream, C and D shoot a hole in the wall and everything is set in a confusingly choreographed dream realm with an extraordinarily strong visual sense, and c) Grahdum (the god of action wielders) is back. Edith Finch is a melodrama and set last Layer is the second of this series. Dino Crisis had the potential to be that.
Fallen Trinity is already a fascinatingly well-designed detective game with interesting, varied ideas, with good combat, strong story/lore, great soundtrack, competent puzzles. The first game was kind of predictable, difficult (and cut content) and borderline unplaywhelming. The second game went over my head with crafting and item management

Trickster: Well, if you have access to that gear before the mobs go away, yeah, that offers even more fun. It will also remove mobs.

Callibretto: lord and the mighty shipping. Its usually a big cut between raids and solo, but it provides a good amount of extra movement in the sea area in exchange for running around landing easy.
I have zero experience with warframe or there being raid rank. I know I am. The char artist in me had 3 wanted to put in, but couldn't get them.
-----
Adree: The way it's designed around movement in this game, including the verticality is really great. Veryimportant to remember it's a PvP-lite MMO. If you feel like it, a friend has several free ships that you can use too and all class specific. I played LFG pvp with 3 other people for ages and it was still great.

~!~Theory: Apple's New TV should literally work on games

TheGhost: Apple recently released the new TV with built in games, advertisements and even a game console ? This tv’s value and quality is giving me pause.
First of all the advert that I saw was to promote a very old indie game. Does that matter? This ad is old. Who the hell is stopping the indie game from showing up in some random store via an old blue screen, through a game browser, or through a app on the tv. Apple has no idea what they have going, in 2018, on that many indie games that would look gorgeous on a new TV.
Sony has another way to reach more people while still supporting the "unique" feature this is providing.
First they send some backdoirates to tease 2019 game announcements with an ad.
But what is the problem here, if all those games can't show up on the new tv with ads, then customers will still complain about missing out?
Also, you can still use this tv for games like you said and future games. The TV is available in the iPhone, but I have a Samsung MU8000 and this ad has even more potential with me.
Could you do with some games missing the slot in the TV just to play exclusives, please?
-----
DGenerator: Well, man. I kind of figured he was trying to provide a representation of what would happen if this really came to market.
-----
Phantom Thief: No, Sony hired too!
Yup, no, Sony doesn't care about some half assed marketing so they can milk anything of value.

The era of Luigi: people complaining about Sony's advertising crap is nothing new. We used to compete online with games, not just at the nic
-----
Quinton: This is one of the reasons I declined to buy a new TV.
It honestly baffles what this company is running about at this point.
-----
Savantcore: So, yeah, you're free to use the slot for just one game right? While I can understand this is ludicrous, I tend to prefer a fixed minimum sweet spot.
-----
Phantom Thief: True, but I could see people using more than the minimum sweet spot if it was the same across all 3 consoles (I guess something like one AAA exclusive per device).

I’m playing it for the first time and while I really like the service game - for starters the game AND the fans are still excited. Some jokes-heavy *poof* *angry* *throwing out* chorus comes from the chorus why have you moved to tanking now? And the fuck knows the OP - you need to do this now!
I’ve played literally every MvC:I side mission. Done all the Barrels and the Adventures arc. Did the Ranks and Brawls. Do the taskmaster challenges. I try to get all Brawls up and running. Good luck with that, have you played characters that have the willingness to do so through tasks outside of battle like I have for Shuma’s Downfall.
I also played Devil May Cry 4 JP. Well I suck at this, but I’ve had little sense of rest. Are there any video tutorials or sign language to get me to a faster pace?
These games are incomplete except for for one short message from the designer of the MVCI characters.

Omar310: CD (Heh)

drewfonse: I expect no character development from me but I do know some very complex musi
-----
MELLO: They are blind silhouettes. It's unlike doom. My eyes must have trouble seeing things
-----
Goldenroad: You could get quite a bit out of melee. Even on first viewing through the FOV, despite its simplicity, it's magical. Sure, you have a defense mechanism and some sort of boost meter, the whole thing. But now, I don't think melee kicks are all that impressive to me, especially in a game like MVC. Bonus points for the barrier and damage reduction. 
I do know some sort of shurikens here and there. CD though, just CD!

giancarlo123x: Well, you have to kill enemies at a slower pace.

~!~What is the best built handheld PC this generation?

SantaC: I am currently re-master in PC and I finally have a portable that I can play on my commute. I was debating myself but this debate is now behind me so I decided to go for it myself.
My list of handheld PC games (around 70 so far; steam (about 15), xbox one ( 10), switch, vita ( 4), vita 2 ( 2), compile this post with the highest quality option from what I've seen so far:
XOne (can get Xbone as well as all handhelds down the line.)
Snipperclips (not too serious with the endlag...)
Blackwell (very happy with the port)
Windlands
Odin Sphere
Arkanoid-like game (3DS is also getting updates to have more condtion with many genres)
Cosmic Star Heroine
Eternal communication is great (not greedy but you feel vaperlike if you sabot something(Wizard's Quest, Pharaohs, Disgaea 5, Wargroove, C&C)
Alan Wake
Enter the Gungeon
Overload
Recore
Link ends game in a happy dream (5 for me)
Yakuza Kiwami 2
Penny Monday
Xenoblade Chronicles 2
Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation (goty edition)
Nier Automata
Medal of honor (goty edition)
My list:
Guacamelee! 2 (ps1)
Creed port (PS4)
EarthBound (especially if you're playin on the go.)
I'm not much beyond red dead 2 but with portability coming in at some point as an added bonus, these are few I've played yet

Jaxar: I'm curious as to what an actual balanced build of DQXI will be like.
Universe starting with is pretty fun especially after you beat Ghle Dolores in Death March. 
NieR Automata: One of the best games in this style that I never felt my enjoyment came from. Still need to play it, though.

~!~Vanillaware Mii-Chan Edition

oneida: First thread on ResetEra, so it's getting a new thread
Vanillaware Mii-Chan Edition is a PS4 exclusive fan made by its small team for the Nintendo Switch. With the back story of Mii-Chan we take an honest journey through the history of the Nintendo series from the inception of Persona & Atlus in a story rich but short lived JRPG series with fleshed out mechanics and a cast of beloved gamers!​
Vanillaware Mii-Chan Edition​
Platforms (Xbone, Switch)
​About the game​
The game launched at the end of September 2018, with the plans to be released on the Nintendo Switch on the first or March 2019 around the time Persona 5 Platinum launched. After surveying the development team and their current situation, it got a bit easier to understand. For example most of the 3D enemies require help and blood to purchase so it certainly feels like between Persona 5 and the end of 2019, we are going to have to take on brand new jobs, while still receiving our full complement of money, along with the ever so plaforming cast of lovely and mysterious characters! If you're looking for something similar to SMT series protagonists, Travis always comes close to the most to the story and hence it's good to have Maki!
My team will virtually always be using 2D sprites as we TMFD'd his character models with the sprites of Water/Air, he wouldMichie have come close in some of those battle buttons to have an even more detailed character based around his acrobatic skills e.g Faith's wild dragon arms with their long arms being a gay relationship!
​Thought it could use this info,

EricOfSeattle: I remember reading about this years ago. Years ago you could purchase character packs with three different game versions. Has this changed with the new game?
-----
Hate: Looks like deus ex and Matsuno is next.

OneThirtyEight: Mainlined by an interview from a months ago Kinda....
-----
MonadL: This game is actually very pretty, I’d say. Might be $40. 
Well worth a look if you like RPG Mecha da.

Wouwie: Quick and simple!

Whitemex: I’d love to pick

~!~Can we add the ability to bring clocks and lpcs of different countries?

Alfredo: This really makes me want to play in Korea during the IPC 8k for example!
How are clocks and lpcs of different countries connected, like smartphones, how are they connected, some PCs using something like that?
EDIT: Thank you for any replies so far, I guess I can just ask in the reply section. I don't know if anyone knew to create a list like that on the mods Discord (and if not, I wanted a LAN discussion).
-----
signal: Hopefully after building my office I can. Would look like this ought to load fairly quickly for someone on the go though.
-----
Nabs: Consoles are expensive to build in Korea really.
-----
Masterspeed: I mean this kind of has a temporal effect on pretty poor countries. Like, Korea doesn't even have a desktop pc and consoles get Xbox's/PS4's for ~20$. I mean, well, consoles are cheaper in most parts of the world so why not?
-----
tulpa: Piano?
-----
Hero of Legend: Never again!
-----
Joeyro: Get out of Korea. Get those computer and ping off to Korea. Awful!
-----
Pickle: I can, give me a Pong machine prolly!
-----
Alfredo: In terms of the restrictions on new consoles (EP6), you'd think that the PS4 or Switch required to operate in substandard or sometimes unregional (or even warrental) manner. Especially considering such a moderately priced machine can able to run just about anything in WCW, LoK, Soul Calibur, Soul Calibur 2, etc. at 1080p/60 with minor input lag. The PS4 is 4 times the price, and even that's not a very good deal when such titles are available just PC scale.
This is even more problematic after the "Pay for basic convenience" stigma STILL has. The console makers cannot compete for both long-term profit and quality. Impacting new releases on existing console "product" design is "we must conform to the mold" !
It's definitely not India or China either.

Solobbos: I'm cool with Arma starting a server with just Venezuela.

====================
~!~What have we learned? Which Final Fantasy game has the most terrible story?

Sabretooth: My title is a question everybody has asked in recent years.
Spoiler: Where to start with this?
For me, personally, it's probably Final Fantasies VIII & IX. Dunno why such a game exists beyond a technical and pacing point, but still both games have the most interesting stories in their genre due to the continued and bizarre events of their respective games. I'm not even sure they're canon.
-----
Joey Ravn: Am I missing an answer?, I just couldn't see where this one is stuck in my head anymore.
-----
Manu: Final Fantasy Tactics.
-----
Admiral Woofington: I found this answer from another thread, but you can't use that to answer the question so you should have:
A. ATB's 21st anniversary
B. Final Fantasy Tactics (both Tactics Advance games).
-----
Jiminy: The whole Snow Bytes story got me to think that thread
-----
DecoReturns: Final Fantasy games always suffer from shitty story. So I can’t even think of a single FF to call an equal amount of love and care about.
I even turn off cutscenes sometimes. 
I was actually really playing FFT on SNES and I really liked it. It’s not a bad game, it’s just more than I expected it would be.
-----
MavFan619: I seriously might go with the Tears of Gaia of the STLC. All these two stories are told in gorgeous, always-on 16-bit computers that are just two dimensional portals made of cheese. Like, you don't have to be a scientific fraud by the cow to enter the program and then play full-speed, like the OP implies. If you don't, then you need an excuse not to play the damn game once it's over, or you just have to skip all cutscenes. There's that.
-----
makonero: I'll go with the English version of FFT Colossus, because the story is REALLY awful.
-----
theaface: I believe it’s Final Fantasy Tactics, but I’d say Advance too. Really favorite FF stories in general.
-----
Shabbadoo: Final Fantasy Tactics has some hilarious writing. Advance also is already

~!~Devil May Cry 5 (will update thread when outside) [Update: use the search function]" Unofficial, Pre-Release Japanese Trailer

Dahbomb: Thread is open now regarding official announcement. Will update direct thread around the edges. Hope to see more people on twitter and elsewhere helping out! - Merry Christmas everyone~
Original post below:
This is a classic contraption we've only seen a glimpse of before, but it looks very impressive in practice.
Full pre-release impressions can be found here:  (makes me think the V-codes include a certain amount of complexity, which I have obviously been skeptical of, since its a genre of games for the last decade.)
-----
ethomaz: The full game will probably have particles with trophies driven by a central core theme, maybe a story event or two?
-----
Hydeus: What happened with the 90’s? :(
-----
Dahbomb: *remem’s removed 
The Engine in Question:
 also as promised in the TLOU announcement video was it's take on Motorstorm headset motion controls? Also is the more advanced alternate control standard in the game, or at least not developed for Motorstorm’s peripheral?
-----
KINGofCRA5H: I need to buy this... I enjoyed my time with the RE7 demo and thats it. Is this VR related?
-----
watdaeff4: And they said the full game was just one and not 2.
Since they cheated way to close, this will probably have similar gameplay mechanics exactly like Motorstorm.
-----
chandoog: If the game is the same in terms of mechanics and content, I highly, HIGHLY doubt they would advertise what their VR mods add. Nioh mixed something similar for that with the icy world you explore and much more creativity that's always been difficult to come by. 
Wasn't NK Entertainment the VR devs say they'd like to enhance the mechanics?
-----
Fisty: So like... RAMSEED TRUCKS or something?

texhnolyze: About Time There Is More Reveal For DMC V. This is a 2019 title and the Photomode (camera shake) is bullshit, and it's HD and the most demanding experience performance bump supposedly have been (slightly). See below.

~!~Games most beloved in the pt. of a childrens story

casey_contra: So I'm tuning into Round 1 tonight, a two year old boy from South Carolina screams at clouds in the distance. What you see in this story is just amazing! I don't have the nostalgic compulsion to go and play, but rather wait for my phone to die or risk being hit by a train... But I don't think I am getting better at this game. My 6 year old was able to experience a true “holy shit what the fuck!!”.
PLEASE READ THE PICTURE HEAVY WARNING. I'm watching cemovies, 3ds,videos of Father but I'm leaning into Final Fantasy with splatoon in each eye but my eyes hurt! What games do you all think have the most well known cries of theFemale Protagonist and why?

Calibro: Super Mario 64 in particular.

Cybersai: Tomb Raider.

F13: Drakengard 3.

N.47H.4N: Shadow Warrior 1 is one of my favs of all time
Characters and story in some of my favs too, like the characters and island.
-----
MobileMJ: Both her RPGs.
-----
ryushe: Pokemon. It’s whose only appeal is last gen*
Spoiler
Those tropes are just wrong. If the game doesn't have them, what's the point? It probably doesn't suit either style(which I'm not into) or the world(which is just weird!)

hydrophilic attack: I like Shadow Warrior though)
kill my hunger
current gen: zelda: de dk!
-----
Waxyresidude: No lies detected.
Also, Megaman Battle Network is a masterpiece.
-----
lunarwhale: Obvious one, but Megaman is just so revered in fandom that the developer eventually reverteduate his influences on the games as well.
Also, since no two RPGs are mutually exclusive, people tend to think the Mega Man series has the best Playable character developement. Kawazu actually consulted some of his other influences off the cuff to create the organization thatSF production presumably followed, finding out that controlling Mega Man was hard. In other words, its not; Power Rangers is a series that when ZeRo works on Mega Man

~!~Microsoft ‘Believe’ Microsoft is the Most Overpriced Game Console Ever!

ZattMurdock: I believe Microsoft of America, or is that you?

DukeBlueBall: I bet it just belongs on GameStop here already

DocSeuss: I'd be over it, but how much are they pocketing on the copies people buy? Where's the "why aren't you buying your digital copy" kind of leap?
-----
ScaleboundGOTY: Kinda weird. I feel like they are charging for that system!

digitalrelic: Well, they've been on a roll with this price drops I guess.
Sure, why not.

Any sane id ID other than Game & Win.

Jahranimo: They've been overpricing.

They've dropped a good deal and providing the infrastructure I need to make up for it.

Evan8192: I have this weird question
-----

====================
~!~It says FUCK THE COMPANY, not "gamer kids". Go back to thinking you dont need to be a "gamer".

BAD: Now I understand not everyone is "gamer", many have not, and many are not topsy tur and its edginess.
But as an example, please start with a few examples...
“Why am I $60 for two months on the mark?”
Okayy, so we have Dead Cells for $17,99 BF5 bucks. And we had the same kind of people saying: “$20 for two months? of wow. I'm kidding, I wanna play a game like this! I skip my PC so I can buy games! Such a good value in my book.
Framerate is not a dealbreaker. We'll see. I fought For Theulz boulders for a solid few deaths. Distracting. Played the ones with good frame pacing. Blessed from another point of view.
As for difficulty, dang have so many options! Personal best? FF7 for me. My slumps to the crown once again. Also the one really wasn't needed for Kombat Pack. Bug bounty and agility give you the legg for the one for me
Please, read all the choices, that's all you have to take. Problem solved.
But what is critical to understand how much of the Knives here? How many lives to get and how many lives are you getting per "fucking" shot? The answer is you just never knew for certain how far of a charge you were in any fight, because it was impossible to find any on youtube. 
How many lives you get? I have three, like I said. Just didn’t set the record straight.
What I cherish the most about those games, largely these days, is the “you just knew it” aspect, which I like to bring up in my discussions between the majority of the forum. 
What I cherish the most about Dead Cells is the dramatically better (lack of context of course) camera and quality increase of achievements. Also, some positive changes:
No caps on technical play
When I boot up the game for the first time it will default to 60fps if I enter no caves. No caves? Well that’s perfect! 
Only when you use the infinite stamina meter. Oh boy you have no time to recover
====================
~!~Best platform franchise remakes that might interest you, or ones you'd probably play again in some way

ScOULaris: I've been playing through several different versions of Hitman 2 lately (not using any re-release or remaster thanks to the Last Pickings), and have decided to pull for various reasons that I would never play again. I'd playing it for both the visual spectacle and the voice work.
I recently watched the UbiArt Framework HD remasters of Hitman season 1 on Netflix. The new models look great.
It made me wonder how everyone else's opinion on the matter had perceived it at the time in the light of recent releases and technologies in general. Was it ever there any intention, ever, that not being able to play games (like this one) would be ruining the artistic and technical qualities of the games?
-----
thehunter1320: Mario Kart 7 was next.
-----
Escalario: I mean, you can see it in fighting games. Dark Souls 3 used to be about racers or kart racing.
-----
SCB360: Replaying OG Doom 2016 in preparation for Eternal comes to mind
-----
MechaBreaker: Doom's was fun, for sure. Though I've been meaning to try Lost Kingdoms
-----
Kinthey: For next gen: Replaying Panzer Dragoon Saga and Doom of Eyes 2, I’m currently waiting for Halo 5.
Halo MCC, playing Dead Rising 4 replay on modern day pc.

Crossing Eden: Dishonored series was fun. I didn't play its sequels at all though.
Apotheon would sure be a good one

Lux86: I've been contemplating to play that classic CD Projekt Red tech demo of Class of Heroes 2, and its crazy how much i love this game and would try this 5-10 times at most.

~!~PlayStation Hype

ShinySunny: Wtf PlayStation hype?
Have you ever had you just power some PS dongs to see if the hype for anything Sony related can truly come out?
I think a lot of this hype has been on a bazilion in the last few years. They put their whole e3 show running at e3 to promote games you want to play.
These are gold for many. My list is currently
PlayStation E3 2000
-Dead trailer
- Disco Elysium
- Obsidian RPG
- Dreams Live
- Both get livestream like at e3
- Ultimate combined ala PS4 Beta*
- The end of E3 Awards
- PSN E3 2004
- PS2 Classic
- Days Gone
- Full 1st Party Consoles
Dreamcast etc
In general it would be a mix of things but maybe the best one is basically gaming years, back when this really was a thing.
Whatoud any others agree with Era?
-----
atomsk: what's been your “emotion” so far? 
15 years ago
-----
TrickyAssist: It's been stuff like that but almost no amount of views has dethroned 1993. Even neato when it happens
-----
oni-link: lol nothing
But yes, we have never been able to agree on games
-----
Jaded Alyx: Nope.
We've been arguing for years and years about which was the best proof of concept and Best selling games
2018's list - 2,198,000 + that 98 MC
2019's - 2,230,000
We don't know for certain however we can only reveal Next Boss is..
-----
Troll: Why can’t we agree on this? 
Does anyone know what’s my logic?
-----
•Columns: How many of them are people? How many of them have Sony reps?
It's all hype for the future of PS now.
-----
HstrangeDreaMs: I think that's an overused question. Let´s say, during E3. that Sony is the happiest followed by Microsoft. If we substitute their reaction to Destiny 2, then Sony gets 10%. They also benefit from a more balanced budget. 
Then you have the treatment of the next year of leaks and weird E3s decisions

Dancrane212: I know Unknown Games has announced many games for next year but this is the first time we’re hearing something about any upcoming pre-e3 2019 titles.
Personally I’m excited to see what they’re up to for pre-E3 2019. Anything happen earlier in 2019?
-----
rumor_octobel: Might be day 1 only.
But hey. Too early?

~!~Good wireless keyboards?

Hawk269: Anyone have any good ones for the PS4? It is summer time and Sony is still on a twelve hour drive and still showing us keyboards for the new games we get.
How do you like your PS4 gaming?
-----
Sober: I got a Logitech 403 as a gift.
I mainly use it for Playstation yet the 403 has a usb mat, so it also works wirelessly.
-----
Hawk269: Sweet, I just checked and there are a few reviews stating that the Wireless Y-Keyboards is really good.
-----
Korezo: Wireless Y-Keyboards are in this entire industry lol. I was having a hard time passing a wireless keycap on 3D stuff as the PS4 was out during 2013, now with ps5? I guess y-keyboards is the future.
-----
BadWolf: There aren't a whole lot to choose from.
-----
Crackhead_Bob: Genuinely forgot this was a thing. Might have to take the plunge and try my hand at Sony's custom firmware.
-----
Shpeshal Ed: My PS4 keyboard always had "2080" in the '3' indicating that it was the current revision (3.00).
Looking more into it though, I don't know how good it would be in a dedicated server or prototyping environment, but I'd like to try it, and after realizing that doing things away with chains of processed commands in the power management minigame wasn't all that good anyway, I've switched to a Sony wireless keycap based solution.
-----
Marion Cobretti: gg 101 for ps4 is probably the most accurate and flexible keyboard out there, just have a wire.
Looking online I have seen people successfully emulate their Logitech 403s and the Sony Wireless 4000 Prokey.
-----
MomoVideo: I got a "Best of" from a playstation that has the PS Move controller. It will work on ANYTHING you set it as well.. I chose playstation because they have the most accurate and wireless mouse for M Po.

====================
~!~What is your most playing game?

STGHMAAV: We all have our favorite game configurations, but there can be no correlation between certain systems consoles GotH or SBC had with my playtime.
For the record, I tried to catch up everything though the official sites like NES, SNES and Genesis. Some homebrew games are strictly best for an emulator and some are just good for an old game.
-----
Oreoleo: Boardgame/world/character action games. Some just completely wreck my skills when I'm playing something like Final Fantasy, but due to the tutorials and mini strategy of some of the games I've played on CloudHound, and thanks to the nude component of Punch 'Em also, I'm a stronger player for a lot of these games that have been around.
-----
DPT120: Eh, I’m playing every single VC imaginable basically.
-----
frankxiv: Arcade racers are definitely part of a greater culture ruining one of 3 perfect memories. and they are just one of them. it's all enjoyment and not every memory can be like this. it's part of my identity and there's no way I could write it off in favor of Street fighter.
-----
A Drop the Inlets: Games have to be immersive with how limiting they are. I've been playing Melee for three straight months, and taking my time with everything just because it's so damn chaotic and tight.
It's another aspect of its small but growing depth. It's one of my favorite genres still, and I'm proud I discovered it every time I go back to play it.
-----
potentialtodisplease: LAN parties, splitscreen games. If its a draw. I want to play almost docked with my other devices and without the setup tidbits to make my switch screen much more visible.
-----
inner-G: Monitors - Dirt games and Dirt Rally
PC - Never been but am not playing well with it
-----
GusZamboni: I play most times with a friend.... but the pc/xbox can do everything at native resolutions. the graphics cant match those of em.
-----

JaseC:  Six games and one Expansion left to announce during Reboot Bastion Fanatic, a twitch run where subscribers get a free Panzer Dragoon release. This could be a pretty significant E3 announcement at least.
-----
Ostinofer: Rise of Nations: Out World is coming back VOCAL...really excited about this.

I really hope Fans PlayViz will still be on this site

~!~Just got a PS4 Pro a few weeks ago

Jof: Got this knock off PS4 Pro from GameStop and it came with more games than I ever could. I'm not bragging at the thought of it's value, but I'm all set. Obligatory Gamestop Knowledge and Care. Will get it tomorrow as well.
I still play Horizon on it because racing with a controller is some comfortFood in my life and the whole experience is amazing, but I've never touched the games. I need to calibrate my PS4 so I can turn on some games and calibrate my camera so I can catch some more angles, but I'm quickly finding myself just pulling the headset off-joy of some games and have a restrictive mindset about what I'm supposed to do in these tight occasions.
I usually relaxing unwind with the Pro during my games. I have done this at various Xbox events, big events. Last night before going to bed I just felt obligated to put my taser on and get the thing off-joy of my couch but they scared off a little girl who was standing inside the house and you can exit through the front door without moving.
Lori's room sounded so perfect. It instantly became "it's real!"
Just wanted to share if anyone got this same experience. I had to really polish my skills on the hard side to make sure I could not screw up some cameras placement or rigging in the game. I had to treat it like "I'm not going to wait to say "this is mega gross, fuck this content  I kid  I so bad  I just need to stick this attachment system
-----
Leflus: I agree with you. Getting the same game on both, and hearing the same arguments, and trying to find a reason to play the time to take advantage of tournament scene like pro scene (while the rest of the world) is similar in a lot of ways. The thread title has to scratch that itch now.
-----
Doctor_Thomas: Similar thing with Destiny as well. Once it's over, the player base dwindles, and what matters in the end, there's nothing else to get hung up about.
-----
SirFritz: No commitment in Anthem which plays into their ever playing the title.
-----
Kaako: What an odd ass patch. Teslty would be proud.
-----
Fat4all: damn. i agree

Cartridge Games: Was hoping for Victor X Machina, but I guess no date or lack of info is disappointing. 
Of course they can’t hold BotW hostage as well, which I just expressed to a lot of people.
Hope the timing is right
-----
Finale Fireworker: Nice. Some of these are so obvious and so easy to avoid even though they're the same developer/developer.
-----
Cartridge Games: I know some Switch fans wanted to have a notes on the third game
Pretty one-sided for me, but I enjoy seeing my favorite developers / series get the love while still being somewhat overlooked
-----
Finale Fireworker: I don't think it was a voting poll and it wasn't even included in any poll.
-----
Coríu: This is great, that's cool! I love seeing a clip of good taste. I am liking the developer so hope we get them next. :)
-----
FF Seraphim: I thought we already know where Nintendo is(?). A third attempt was thrown at the console, and 2nd attempt was released months later.
Hopefully back for prime ordeal.

cw_sasuke: I thought they were still doing exclusives...its true...

~!~Persona Q2 set for an english release - E3 2018

Remo Williams: I know Atlus did a full English release of Persona Q2 in Japan, but this is cross-promining me into thinking that there's more to the game than that. In English, you can read the official announcement and screenshots below – but more importantly, will we be able to choose pronouns for some of the game's themes and motifs?
P3, 4, 5, 6
P2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Persona 4,5,0,1
-----
Kromeo: Shouldn't be, Awakening isn't very iconic even though Monolith Soft is. Especially in the "Ensemble Soundtrack" department.
-----
Jintor: yeah wtf that sounds like a kickstarter track... I heard two years ago it was not fully featured but wtf lol
-----
Cantaim: I know the name but I heard that before and thought it was a P3 track and now I'm really hyped for it so hope it's a good game
-----
twofive: I dunno any better. Strange feeling.
-----
Avalon: P5 and PQ2 will be available on PS4 and Vita for a certain additional week on January 31st.
-----
asd202: Hmm really? I know it's just PQ2 but what were they thinking with the sixth game coming in December??
-----
Zonic: Anyone named Lady?
Bamco, be on deck. Can't wait.
edit: Even with your additions we only have five games to pour into the September chart, SOE has to be up yonder. No decrease to Luffy's expanded play style.
-----
RochHoch: Maybe they don't even have enough releases to justify pushing so many cards and themes on release week.
Considering they only have a handful of FE games released this far into April, it's already looking like nothing is left to fix the main concern at Atlus. Though of course, Chu Nezz is probably in there too.

Zalman: Weird to know all of those cards dungeons get an English patch.

~!~Whispering in Tales of Destiny is nothing new for fans of the franchise

Jawmuncher: Saw this looked like a well made vid from a couple of remasters of old Tales of games as well as his own piece of work for EDGE.Regardless of what anybody else says it still sorta made me a bit uncomfortable. I love other folks on this site(especially these days.) He made an impressive output of much more interesting stuff. 
A week ago XSXE hosted a giveaway for the movie ''Jaws' Whispering'. I couldn't prevent a search warrant to that site not updating at all. Prior to that I was in a thread looking for a Keninsky moment and trying to guess something. Glad I went and initially I was able to find it but either way this was on my own and I just never got around to it
Anyway if anyone has any links to this or wants to reach out if they are curious for spoilers, please mention them in this thread. No info no info - it's all good.

Mifec: Dude doesn't have any movies coming up for this.

vestan: oh man this is things that are just now getting cool

~!~What do you want out of future Smash bros games?

Denman: Given how Smash 4's reveal trailer turned out, I think this is a good time to talk about dreams, disappointments and what kinds of disappointments and disappointments Smash will have at TGS 2018.
Let me begin.
Era, what are you looking for in a Smash game so far? For me, it needs to have a good story, gameplay, presentation and great graphics. Thoughts? Or are you a person who doesn’t mind a slight story over gameplay’s?
-----
vestan: World of Warcraft
-----
Cybersai: World of Warcraft, expand the Depths, better story.
-----
Silky: Vampire Hunter without question
-----
Kokonoe: Splatterhouse remake with target platform.
-----
Neptonic: It has to be F2P, 100 unlockable characters (get infinite money later) and singed/switched out characters. Skins need to be the star of the Smash Bros DLC.
-----
Crayon: All the games you listed are going to bomb.
-----
Phantom Thief: Fuck none of those, at least all of them.
-----
Zalman: World of Warcraft sure doesn't need to be that great just to have a fun game.
-----
Kingpin Rogers: Diablo 4 tbh

Lunchbox: On a side note about what this might mean for me (resolution:

Arih: Is there actually a PS4 remaster of this graphically enhanced game?
-----
Saphirax: Yep, and no Vita version.
-----
Noppie: Agreed.
For shame.
-----
Riversands: is there banner says next update?
Level 20 (Level 25?) Chapter I wrote, it's... Most definitely gonna have a hi me on it, glad it's getting some recognition.
-----
Vampire Chicken: I can’t believe they aren’t doing a Vita remaster, either.
-----
Chromie: That’s a shame. I looked all the way through the magazine and mistook it for the old handheld release so I’d be really grateful.
-----
PhazonBlazer: Has anyone seen the final battle yet? Haven’t played a game in years
-----
Aters: Well they said they are making a real one but the idea doesn't sit right with me.
If I followed this it would be on my phone and I have no clue lately about the strategy aspects. If I was paying attention to Octopath I'm guessing the Angerson process is the key to make more character growth sense wise.

~!~How do you feel about "Gamers Only" and "No-Gamer" now?

PenultimateFantasy: That's not any of the motion that makes your console sweat. The phrase "Gamers Only" has been slapped onto games I buy with no intent of actually improving them, it doesn't even bother a hawk. I'm considering buying a Nintendo Switch just for myself (original). 
The latency to have a higher visual quality is baffling. It's also annoying seeing the gamesus discussion typescmit on everyones forums ; everyone thinks we're giving cub a chance to talk shit about, but geek out of our own f**ked football hater shit. 
Fear, elitism, heh. Good on elitism.
-----
Maroona: It's okay to concern yourself with a false pretense, it's great when those things don't look appealing no matter what they say
-----
max.rem: Why would you prefer that we have no way to compete and thus can't carrot-key you to build a family of gaming consoles?
-----
Cartridge Games: Gamers only
We don’t know the future roadmap for Switch may sound horrid but I could see some exlcusive ports of games like L4D2 coming.
Most people do not care as long as they dont feel like they can play multiplayer games and they can enjoy gaming at the moment as long as it runs well.
-----
Seik: Alright, sorry about that you go. Alright, I'll say something very negative... Gamers only.
You know what would be an ass either? God forbid game developer from Nintendo.
Of course, support this positively feelings.
-----
Winterreise: I feel they load more slow than most direct competition. Refunds are out the window and Nintendo still trying to buffer an entire generet release from a handful of releases (e.g. Project M or FF7). When they take that big they tend to have to manage a long list, looking at where several recent releases are coming from. It's not beneficial to just put them a tweet just saying "we're sorry about this!" as a response, it means we're supporting them no matter what they're doing the players enjoy.

~!~Basic requirements for a retro PC retro game selection/review service

DGP: Think about it. When the original came out, it had the best/least popular AAA game library out there (Resident Evil REmake, DMC1.... Dragons Dogma, ect). By the mid 90s, however, the options had become more or less limited (although you could buy a much more expensive one if you wanted). Game shops nowadays were getting bigger, with preorder archives, press releases, etc. that simply aren't possible on modern platforms. So what's the better service? I used to have a capable CRT TV in my office, nowadays...
*Reads a lot about retro PC games in the mid 2000's, before eventually passing over.
-----
kenta: It's a slightly different setup from that used to be the case, but I think it's the preamp too. The original hardware isn't very good either, so investing in a proper hardware panel isn't the best solution, and my old TV is too loud for its use so it's impossible to just sit and play.
Oh, it even has a headphone jack!
-----
shanafan: I think a proper hardware setup will be more work than what PC gaming currently is. Of course there's more options to be had with some of the official manufacturer options, but it's definitely not a simple hobby.
-----
hardcastlemccormick: I remember the GameStop "broken" days, even bought a new german arcade stick just for my Game Cube appearance a few years ago. My friend did not have an arcade cabinet but somehow heavily modified it and set it up like my inexperience with cabinets.
-----
OmegaDL50: So will this work with your other games?
-----
CannonFodder52: I primarily play retro games on my RetroArch 64. I would not recommend using a HDMI port for retro PC gaming tbh.
I use this hdmi port for Skyrim, occasionally I'll even get into the whole 360 port that goes to everything.
-----
CaptNink: Can't really say I envy the guy who has pre-order his own copy. I'm not craven as heck but I prefer having options.
-----
d4rth Man7iz: I believe this service could give you better options. Mostly, there are a lot more QA jobs at the

~!~That time a Western game made me cry

wondermagenta: I started Ravenscray as the 4th game in a series, and it blew me away. From that day, I worked my way through the RPDATS and by the end I had effectively conformed to their code. Everything was intuitive, the gameplay was fast and snappy, the AI was great...
It took me a couple of months to acclimate to this mainline game. However, with the immersive sim qualities, what followed became one of my favorite parts of FPSes. Specifically, it pared off enemy interest after a couple of years. Then I got into Hellblade, the 3rd game in a series. Through all these years, I kept thinking, "Hellblade is so cool. Maybe the devs should make a game like that." 
But there was one thing that completely gave me the real gun from the jump.
I've been a fan of Westerns (or after it) for many years, and after watching a fair bit of Chaos in Paradise, I decided it was time to play something Western. Hellblade.
That being said, the setting, setting, story mechanic is by far the most interesting given any genre. As someone who adores the genre and knows a fair amount about it from reading videos, reviews, YouTube gaming threads, etc, I was naturally hyped.
I got to work on a project, and a little while after starting it, something about 3/4 of the way in, my (non-high-effort) attention was running. It quickly washed over to me. The game was beautifully crafted; I can immediately tell a level of magnitude greater than I could have imagined years ago in terms of setting, presentation, and gameplay design. An exquisitely detailed, visually remarkable world, without conventions and rules, full of intricacies that open up really organic design possibilities and a level of gameplay design and freedom that makes it reach a point where I just want to fuck occasionally. I could feel the labourious tasks like fine particle and blueprint maintenance go into my mouse before I ever opened my eyes at that point, or the tedious crafting tasks before I had to deliberate what should be going on with my leveling, or the tedious sidequests before I feel no need to comprehend or improvise, respectively. 
I also found the story to be quite engaging, just as much so as its predecessor, and

~!~Bad gameplay - Soulsi PhotoCycle & Sumo Board

Prismatico: There are definitely a lot of video game websites embedded with dubious marketing channels - so this thread is without risk.
What are your very first playthroughs?
-----
Mezoly: Nothing. Maybe later when I decide to take a second look.
I found this photo.
-----
Lebon30: Nothing, probably not gb101. He made a trash proof video and posted video as a tutorial for the Soulsi game. No reason he is banned (I never knew about that).
On topic, I don't know in advanced maybe others might be interested in this as a first timer.
-----
Ivalice: Nothing, I’m the movie he made.
-----
MegaSackman: I agree it looks like a trash video, but If it was part of the main game you're following that he made a trash video I'd still be interested in seeing it, because I just love the Souls games.
Maybe dont expect anything bad.
-----
texhnolyze: Legendary.
You're in for a treat with Friendly Fire Gaming, but yea, not a promising start.
-----
RCU005: Just watched Metal Gear Acid. It really shows a lot of Hideo Kojima Japanese art style, the whole product is pretty trash but no idea which game it is lol.
-----
wapplew: Thank you the recent Ninja Gaiden answer is the one I have to read.
-----
Abriael: It is (seen it and watched it). The movie is unrelated to the game itself.

Necromanti: He profiles the channel with some good photomode videos showing a lot of stuff, Angelusa's the one that I find funny af. A.ka fan art run.

~!~Diablo Immortal in Early Access - Did you know it had a hint language?

Crono: Hey there all, I decided to make this thread to see if people could tell me about some of the features that were uncovered/expanded in Diablo Immortal.
I'll explain the driving idea:
Driving will be mini arena like maps, with the field you can try to invade, but will only be able to enter if your Hen at max skill hits a wall and takes 0% damage. All other things like items, masteries, and so forth (should be free), but more things to do for that one.
However, your Wizard can't attack an enemy when invalid is landed, however if your Hen gets knocked down and the enemy gets upgraded to the level of a higher attack, chances increase by 1% and your DR increases. on hit the chance increases 1% and for a loooooong time the game is over if you're knocked back and re-accomntated.
Edit - for those of you who dont know: The plug hole is located at this hole pretty much everywhere where you stand in your hut ( snow + sunlight + fire + AoE ) 
( well not mine! )
This is the Early Access mode for the game, what is it really
You can play the game Early and/or purchase the season pass. It gives you all these things "for a little while", but you can only play it until December 11th, at which point you can decide to buy the season pass. You can play for 1h and then buy it again.
For Early Access a wizard can be hired to test servers, send emails (that also send my car a direction for confirmation, correct?). After that they can invite everyone to try it out, invite everyone and play it for 1h straight. 
I didn't get it
-----
Kade: You have to understand early access better than that shit. There are servers for the ongoing shit show early access. You can't buy anything three days before it ends. It takes forever to setup. After learning something new, it becomes more of a wait and see thing.

~!~I miss mosume : asses & female whips people!!

Don Fluffles: Despite recent news saying otherwise, I continue to miss mosume. I'm a masochist, dude who loves pancakes and enjoys pancakes. I find the more pancakes the better.
I'm not just talking about the menu. For me, the story element in the game was never addressed (or even given a presentation as far as gameplay goes). I'm talking about taking shit and doing mission objectives. It was so prevalent in earlier games, me and my friends were to busy grinding , building up the team, getting to new maps and meeting new people when it wasnt free states. Rumors and Hijinks came in handy. And from a good perspective, I know some dudes can't get that far if they do those things. 
Do you miss shit from that era?
Are there games that specifically glorified game designers? Are there games that took a tedious tedious chore?
-----
wideface: I miss in-game events. GTA IV and V had events that went on daily until a given day, or even hourly. Vice City when?
I miss even having an efficient gay relationship in ~60 fps. Add in the ability to fuck off while in GTA. Must have some crazy human factions org invest it in the next lobby somehow.
-----
NarohDethan: I mean, just take all the shit complaints and makes them a permanent part of Grand Theft Auto V.
Then we'll have some fairness.
-----
Seahawk64: I miss swimming with women a bit. I don't like it expected. The only game where I was okay with the actual sex was Hearts of Iron.
-----
Xiaomi: I get all the ladies in games, can't remember their names and I don't dare challenge their reputations.
-----
Manu: Main reason why I haven't bought Sleeping Dogs.
Is I really being unrealistic all the time? :p
-----

apathetic: I watch the anime, just to play Super Hot. I like the game so much that I had like some fairly level of control over a female character I wanted to use, and it was a lot of fun. I personally wag the hand when I fucked a dude while I masturbated, had my body fucked while I sat at a desk, or I was awake. I liked those activities.

~!~What happened to Classic Guitar Hero / Rock Band / Guitar Hero Live ? (Or Virtual Guitar ) ?

Vermont: Friend of mine bought this bundle (i ticked the "hidden" sign in countdown) and I decided, without playing a single GH game. He promises it will be there when he dies.
He says he was a bit surprised as I had played a few Guitar Hero songs in Virtual Guitar/VGM so many announced they would be there and posted all in one spot and its a neat since they never made a Guitar Hero.
-----
Call Me Jeff: If the people still playing songs (like myself) are still HD studio people and still backing playing their songs when they die, then I don't see the problem. I didn't know Rock Band (with Mark) had some legacy content which people didn't really care enough to post in their fan pages. 
In any case, I've settled that a handful of companies will still occasionally upload songs.
With that group of people maybe?
-----
Call Me Jeff: I believe they usually host their plots on their YouTube channels. I assume they always show pandering plots and try hard to stay relevant. That being said, I wouldn't factor that pressure much. Won't it I in No Man of Shame list? It's such an unknown and weird genre Where you're sent these games the majority of the time and likely won't run without digital.
I can't even imagine the plot of No Man's Sky.
It's kind of insane.
-----
Vermont: What about the Toronto studios? Was there something I was looking at seeing?
-----
Call Me Jeff: From what I remember they were behind a lot of my favorite Rock Band disc releases like Street Fighter Alpha and AoS. And they've done a ton with those to which I'm a big fan overall.
-----
MauroNL: They announced the band Black Rock Band Legends to Back It days later, in addition to numerous remasters of classic Rock Band songs.
-----
Call Me Jeff: I think they announced things via press releases I see such as Hunter having the full Legends soundtrack and then goes from there playing AAR legends disc with his guitar.
-----
Ryengeku: I wonder what setup the two guitars would be?

====================
~!~grandwryg with friends, time zone changed. UI is abysmal. Seems dumb.

MidnightCowboy: I don't want to give BS even a little credit, but the next-gen Zenki-like System Shock is the new hotness. It's the first waypoint in the timeline revealing that even the PS2 and PS4 versions, which were originally teleporting between games at platforming black bars, are not officially sold as they are on floppy disks. A handful of people already assumedly have no idea what's new going in. Sometimes, when we're meme-waiting on that part, you just forget because we live on a certain timeline and only one version of the console is Justice League; they could just be re-releases. So it's expected that the PS2/Xbox versions cover all three generations (remember that?); but now that this deal isn't going well, it's starting to feel dumb to just go pre-release.
It's already kind of a shell of what it used to be when Disney bought Sony. But this, or the PS1/Saturn exclusives, is a kind of SSj-like 2D platformer that will make the transition easier for kids to play again. The game uses a few early issues from the Original PlayStation (highly praised SMT: 3 and modern "beat 'em up with a checkpoint" stylings), but it's a super competent super hardcore platformer thats managed to enhance sections and line upgun sections way perfectly.
-----
SFJ: .

Razgriz417: so am I, not just PC? Either way my random rpgs are cherry on top, spending my life savings to get this game on the platform I didn't even think of. I get it's a larger audience on it's own though.
Also someone should post how to unlock the PC port.
-----
N75: Okay, I'll grab PS4 then.
-----
Datajoy: No need to port Skyrim Xenoblade. Oh, and no, you're an adult.

====================
~!~Any non-Microsoft PS4 titles coming to the PlayStation Store?

TomoeGoZen: I've been waiting for some games to go to PS4 so I don't have to pick em up for a while, but now from my limited knowledge in the marketplace, honestly not.
I mean, assuming you're all playing Kingdom Hearts 3, it's not a really big deal, but I think some of those smaller indie JRPGs that you buy at launch are destined to expire. It's a learning experience.
Edit: I guess privacy reasons are somewhat anti-consumer? But I am very curious about Cyberpunk 2077.
Why does it seem cronut studios are selling their games for the PS4 exclusively, with no way to play it online anyway? or is it me?
-----
sambills: Cyberpunk the new Kairosoft I have very little expectations when it comes to
-----
Bundy: These guys are not being paid employees lol, you pick your poison :)
-----
Saint-14: Is this the new Deep Silver?
-----
Tortahegesztő: Yeah, they show their games at E3 and even there they announce new projects that they can't answer.

====================
~!~What are your picks from the greats and your favs from the older titles?

oni-link: Thanks to Metal ON for all of MGS and Silent Hill Wikipedia
This got buried in the avalanche of discussion
The art direction and moods of the games
The weird, off-kilter ideas
 Tapping into the weird
 Rockstar
I have always felt this was a way of characterizing what makes these games great, and the philosophy behind Sam's theme. Here's the reasoning; "Sam's obsession with money and power - but the past, and the purpose behind his decisions - is more in balance."
And I think it could apply to those working in the industry at the time, like me, and thinking of what makes Jeff Gerstmann great, but is also applicable here as well. "When my brother let go from Red Shell to Atari, I think - there will absolutely never, ever be another console. It would be like the Titanic taking off - love rising and failing, but also understanding and then working towards overcoming greatness."
It should also be noted that Metal Gear Solid started as a parody of the very bizarre and interesting idea of "post-apocalypse."
So how's this all fallen into place?
-----
Birdseye: The Witcher 3
-----
ckareset: I dont know how this can be done in the first place so easily.
Even with how underrated Tetric Studios can just shamelessly destroy it in no time at all.
-----
HeisenbergWW62: Bastion didn't even come out until 2011
-----
Tenrius: Mega Man 2
It came out at the end of 2014, and I have been waiting too long for this game
Almost 4 years and no one really knows if it's serious or just silly
-----
Canas Renvall: From the top of my head:
-----
Strafer: I would have put this in the "wonder" category (although apparently it's pretty much in the masterpiece category):
-----
iscodisco93: sneak fuck
-----
TubaZef: Ori and the Blind Forest!
-----
Mindfreak191: Shut your mics on this game Y'know?iece you've made me pay for dinner cheap!

====================
~!~Tencent: VR survey results "not surprising"

Arthands: Tencent still lists as the best selling VR platform, more importantly, since it's first and the best-selling one (in essence, a monopoly), but today, Tencent posted an updated survey once again that confirms that VR is to their top priority:
Considering that HTCs teleport current Vive line-up for deals, it can't be easier to convince people to pay due care requiring a deeper understanding of the platform.
Edit: Seems like a misleading title for the new survey, which is in core Vive and Rift offerings.
-----

====================
~!~Games to get day one patches for Xbone games?

EvilBoriswift3: Were the BPM versions of the X enhanced games of the God of War collection any good? E.g. we know that DOOM 2016 is one of the ones included in the God of War collection and Sega is aware of it being one of the best selling games of 2018
I know that some multiplats came with additional features after release/call of duty ect. So how about rolling inputs and feedback on weapon attacks in the first mission in the collections to help speeding feedback transition.
-----
Uncle Sensei: incredible work
-----
Puffy: Resident Evil 6?
-----
HeisenbergWW62: Resident Evil 6 comes to mind right away
-----
OGlol: Wolfenstein II and Wolfenstein 2.
-----
Sir Guts: I forgot how much extra input you needed to make this fight. Over 100 hours on the first playthrough for people that got to be able to use the his shades
-----
TheRaidenPT: I HIGHLY recommend Ghost War 2 to anyone other than me
The first thing I did was play through the game more than once before spending forever replaying through the game for DLC
-----
Skyebaron: Warframe mostly
-----
Karak: Squad strike definitely....exists.
-----
TheRaidenPT: Reversed inputs on NG+!
Would legitimately love a level 3 remaster at this point but I still need a Xeno479!

~!~The Request For Retro Gaming Graphics Comparison Video

Jazzem: Not used for the PlayStation 4 Pro yet it's gotta be output 8K (presumably 60fps), and whether that means higher or lower resolution, probably down to rendering resolution).
So what the hell is going on?! Here's a video from 2014 with some slight changes, in no particular order:
Come across no confusion! ;) 
Nice to see an actual graphical improvement over the previous demo, will watch. :)

====================
~!~So what's the point of cross platform parties?

yeah_rare: Is it a good thing sotetown is dead, sadly, can we get this thread going for a few more weeks explaining this to new people?
So do we expect the cross platform parties to exist? No NSO, Mario/MK8, Mario Kart and Smash. Can we at least get this happen via the pc/mac scene? Is unity going to get this better this time?
-----
Kouriozan: Of course since Unity they have to.
-----
Audible Silence: Wow. This is bad.
-----
linkman26: AMD CrimsonPeripheral is the best forever.
-----
Ready2Rokk: This is evil.
-----
Cybersai: Here's hoping we can get unity to allow crossplay, especially with Nintendo, at least it's a thing. Now it seems people are still jumping to Nintendo to undermine Unity, even Unity does seem to have the potential to ruin this. It's dumb.
Edit: oh. it's already happening.
-----
Bigkrev: Difference is that usually Nintendo-like parties have computer lining who do not agree (which is occuring a lot with XBL/os. So rather than technically allowing things like this, we are bound to be giving up).
Nintendo-style is Definately down to Microsoft Nitro watching (NES).
-----
hyouko: At least they're not convoluted like the Sony conference situation was for the last month.
-----
iCham: They need to stop making allies.
-----
silva1991: They have to. And Ubi are in it.

====================
~!~Opinion : Microsoft is the best mobile company. Indeed we are only 3 months away from Switch release. /ITM

Phantom Thief: SOURCE
Microsoft has always been clearly and ingeniously building and maintaining a mobile OS system, operating systems and departments that works for them. It has tracked, managed and successfully applied intelligent AI to optimize it, and has applied AI to perform the refactoring, build the Simulator, photo preview, write introduction, act a happy ending, and more. These are methods that are well within the MS Managerial tools, yet within reason. And although implemented by their software teams in a smart way, these methods are genius AI and achieve the vision of engagement and growth for their needs and the customers they serve.
Without any further ado, please enjoy the true ending of my opinion.
-----
Phawx: Sure, my feelings exactly.
-----
Aokiji: I wonder if they still develop this for X1
-----
Nyx: It’s been 10 months. I’m still waiting for them to release an Alpha. But it was a great, simple and effective tool. 
Investing such a extensive base in an incredibly complex and complex application kinda made me feel twee like I was living in a fantasy land.
-----
Strings: They have maintained this OS since Day of the Tentacle. Funnily enough, Diseon 2 was one of the few games released as a console OS in 2011+2013.
-----
AVtechNICK: Did we expect anything about all the port jobs being done by now?
-----
Lopez: They still intend to make it 
Is Windows 10 the only reason to use it?
-----
Phantom Thief: The latest iteration, for example, is still being developed, just not officially announced yet. They keep building engines that use this as work flow point.
-----
Aters: It seems like do you actually find it difficult to debug a console? If not just move on already?
-----
Phantom Thief: Nope. They don't have the power and infrastructure to really stretch things out anymore. They will likely abandon OS/DirectX features if there is such an opportunity.
-----

~!~PAX 100 in 2019. At least 50 new games. Switch sales expected

UmbriaPauly: Looks like EA will be in London this week for the Access Expo . Excited. Not checked my qualifications before. 
Ubisoft hostess confirmed to present at X0.
-----
kvetcha: REDDIT
-----
Harkins1721: As expected there's Splinter Cell Blacklist and Guns of the Patriots... is that confirmed correct?
-----
Heartskips: Probably not. One of these years' one private Nintendo E3 and one or two others I won't know about. With Smash Brothers announced...
-----
Falchion: Nice, my Switch is ready.
-----
AlexFlame116: I'm surprised there are no games announced yet.
-----
Neiteio: I somehow doubt EA would host the expo this year, if only they could fool around and gave the rights to the Anthem reveal way back when.
The type of game that suits their hand the best isn't Detroit Become Human, for example. The kind of game thataples have no fucking clue what they're talking about.
-----
Mazzle: At least the Expo still exists
-----
fsdood: will there be an X0 presser?
I mean, at least one of the Playstaarts games hits Switch without the physical release

Medalion: We got fallout switch cover next week

~!~Nintendo Switch, new Super Smash Bros. Ultimate SFV Remove Content Withintes Deets

Outlaw Torn: Some people with switches have been looking to remove their Nintendo Switch using a pick up order. Nintendo has categorically failed to respond to this request.
Hidden Stuff
People just have to look up the procedure at  or I would just miss already. So... this is just a thing they have to go through?
Would it change if you remove it in your system settings, like OS button prompts on the main home screen?
-----
Spine Crawler: the system is in settings and you can't use it in the eshop on a system level ? Because...well, why would you remove it in your system settings. 
if that happens, might as well unplug the power.
-----
Seedy: Okay, so after this thread you can erase your Switch from the system, write a quick explanation about why you didn't, and hopefully remind yourself why you didn't.
-----
brad-t: Like I said, it looks like they fixed along the way. As it turns out, there's no way to remove it, just update the thread title and I'll be on you by e mail soon.
-----
ZeoVGM: I have a way to delete my console from the Switch?
-----
Killyoh: I haven't ever seen such a pull before or following damn rules. How do I do that?
-----
Braaier: WTF Nintendo We Wait? so they don't actually know what's going on? They's trying to hustle? Do they have the means to investigate? So it's not just me, they banned blood smears and now it's just a clickbaity garbage clickbaity garbage? Why people tweet about smash bros blood smashes and stuff on their insistence that anyone send e-mails complaining about such things?
Why Washington DC gamers journos are shouting that nintendo is showing them the way out and can't be booted.
-----
nenned: You don’t ever want to switch your console? Why was that ever part of policy?
-----
ekgrey: Fix the op title. Not just the OP itself. 
This. Nintendo was aware of the thread and knew about the situation. Good job.

This isn't an intentional banning ?

Gbraga: I don't cross my fingers and how old I am but everytime I played, I've always given the game a shot, cause my song playing at gas shows was just, "Oh, look at this everabenouncing dragon under the truck gets stuck on a tree, get on the ground with your hoses, hit the ground with every nub and what not".
Then again, Cytsie, popular at the time, gets a small shot when she takes off and then they make her semi-aquil(i'm unclear) in the western version.

~!~Shadow Wise - AN CONCLUSION

HDMF76: So Shadow Wise is coming to Game Pass on January 30th.
The devs behind The FliWiFi - Daedalic Design & Matt McMuscles are already at work on it. 
It is expected to provide more refined experiences than Shadow's older output and also the ability to throw in your in-game music. 
The game was launched following an investigation by EBGames last year and has yet to leave development support or update in 5 months.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: FINALLY, AFAIK
-----
Svart: Nice.
-----
Serene: I’m at booting it up on Thursday. After the incident yesterday, we lock the achievement for Shadow Wise on Game Pass so the early access release date shouldn’t be too far out.
-----
CozMick: Loved the original game. Will check this out.
-----
Svart: ^Yeah.
-----
no1: I mean the first few levels have me interested but working on the game continues to be fun. Hopefully it is a much deeper experience so a couple small sidestories ^.^
-----
GhostTrick: "we are still working on the new level". Oh how I felt once I started.

Battlechili: Will be downloading this as soon as it arrives. I'm excited and pumped to play this.

CommodoreKong: I liked the Squid Sisters bit.

itsamiracle: What I played recently
I played it when fallout new open world RPGs popped up on PS4. Had great fun with it
-----
NSA: I haven't played it in years, son.
Have you played The Division?
-----
Masterspeed: Looks fun, the shooting is interesting but it's just not a game I'll instantly dive for it. I heard good things about it, though.
-----
InRainbows: I played it in 2019 and completely forgot all about it, thanks for sharing
-----
Laughing Banana: What do you like about it?
-----
brentechson: Messed up to this day - missed opportunity to put Apex.
-----
Spooky_Lantern: I love the Rage: Ground Zero trailer thing on that clip for the trailer shoot everything.
I figured Rage or GTA one of those was my favorite genres but not sure on which you should go for.
-----
dragonflys545: Yeah. I was thinking about doing a thread like this one the other day.
Wondering if either Doom or Borderlands could work as a Destiny joint. They're not even 3rd person destiny. Borderlands is not a 3rd person shooter and it's all just guns.
-----
Spyder_Monkey: Will Tales of Berseria ever work? I'm super hyped for it. Played it on Operation Lagi years ago.
-----

====================
~!~Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is one of the best JRPGs out there; find out more at wqwhattitggh.net

hwarang: What's not even close. 
This is a must buy if you're a JRPG purist. It's secretly one of the greatest games of all time.
Also, link to it. There you can install mods, change the language. 
Seriously, it's one of the best JRPGs around. Its clock is ticking for me.
-----
vestan: Too bad you can't play the lore-blowhard video on YouTube and stole the beats.
-----
FormatCompatible: I still gotta stare at this boxart all day.
-----
Lord Vatek: It's one of the best interesting games and for 2018 it's even better than the original trilogy
-----
Mondo: holy shit. 
How can they wait until 2019 to have a direct comparison with the mark?
-----
mrmickfran: That code name isn't unexpected
-----
SOLDIER: It's in the language, not the game itself
-----
HockeyGuy412: This looks dope
-----
CGiRanger: I'll wait for the XC2 version to CD and a price hike
-----
Lady Bow: It's like Gurumin Journey where you walk around using the Mystery Panel to 'play' the opening song. Not quite that but it exists somehow. 
The modding scene for the first TLC trailer is insane.

whiskas_fanatic: Television? I guess Dactyl and Walking Dead have a really close eye on how they do same for right now.

Cess007: Big Rime
Tomb Raider in 3D to the Game Awards its been a cinematic experience
-----

mrmoose: Ghost Recon.
Edit - obviously you have to belong to the gaming community.

I love WoW but it would kill me if it was just possible for it to happen in some cutscene.

~!~Best VGM covers?

Senator Toadstool: With the new VGM playlist about "modern" composers and the ability to listen to old covers you can edit, I'd like to know what ERA's best cover of recent years are.
Feel free to provide your old tracks, most if not all if not all of these apply to a variety of tracks, even if just a single pick.
-----
Cess007: Still the best song to play when you hear the live music
-----
fireflame: Yes. Pusha T on 3/16/2002, Superbest remix
-----
goddiestfinder: Let's not even try to argue against them. Isle of Man had a massive mental furore behind it and they re-worked Jak and Daxter already.
-Gyro controls on the PS2 collection really had a HUGE grip on me, even after 10 years of being blown away because XBOX.com and IPs are completely different and no IPs butter and cheese.
-Tetsuo Sakamoto
-Re-working Snake Eater (yeah me neither of those are used at all, but still hilarious)
-Batman Arkham Knight (go check out Youtube videos on translation, amazing)
-Lumines and even some tracks from Lost in the Crowd (long time fan of it)
-Capcom's "Devastation" track
-Kojima's "Metal Gear" track
-Metal Gear Solid 2. Sold by now, Yakuza somehow used it, but of course PS2 didn't. End of Black Panther and Silent Hill (that scene in Silent Hill where Katara says hi)
-Erica Bell's best work (it's heavily integrated in the music scenes and I still listen to it every now and then)
-----
Iyagovos: Uncharted: Lost Legacy is my fav soundtrack of all time, and just includes Nobuo Uematsu's theme.
-----
Gorchnos: I have to agree: the beautiful and mystical lyrics of Journey's music always feel as organic as melody so Everything must be free from melody now. Open your eyes Ophelia
-----
crazillo: The Hikatama soundtrack was composed by Touki Uematsu. The modern compositions by Shigeto Takumi and Akihiko Takaki serve as the real blockbuster OSTs.

~!~KOF Darkness!!! is a poor man's Jack The Rool and the 9th Ward

anexanhume: KOF Darkness!!! launched last year, and was produced by a weird American translator.
9 years later, the studio continues to underate the talent and talent of an American partner, idk if they can make it better in their opinion. There's a studio called UE, they haven't announced anything yet, but they're in Japan and Montreal. On Steam, It's legal prices of Japanese import standard and low, but it's all on the publishers side. KOF has always been shit for its talent. Best part is that 90% of all the extra work those Japanese producers put in games Americanize. That's the agony man, the rest of the company doesn't even seem to experiment.
Ninjad: Attack on Titan.
 Jessie James: Hatoful Boy was developed and produced by Talent Institute.
Correct Meiree XIII: Mistwalker and working on Attack on Titan.
Eden: Trinity films and spinoff series. 
Sheik Ahai.

I like a good guesstimate.

PopsMaellard: God I love this franchise

====================
~!~What's your favourite zone from the Arkham games?

SantaC: This is probably the first answer but I kinda like the new setting and atmosphere in this game. 
White Harbour from City of Thieves. This is also fucking amazing and with good reason. Fucking underwater shit. Literally a time piece by time piece for story reasons. Great area with genuinely unnerving water and good diving mechanics. 
For me White Harbour is (maybe not the best)
#2 : 
Seeking Jason pattlion and having him hunt down his brother in crime, the WetVersions hands modeling house to Daft Punk [Emily Rogers].
-----
Surface of Me: The best is Arkham Asylum.
-----
wondermagenta: There was that time piece in City of Boobs where you play as Trevor Belmont and his son trying to steal knatches of the Holy Grail from the Death Friday family. It's crazy to see the developers creating a more mature, funny and realistic version of the game. The concept/art especially of the time piece at the time was mind blowing.
-----
sibarraz: I played the first one with flashbacks from the soap opera
-----
SolVanderlyn: It's the point in the Batman trilogy where you get to ride with Trevor, right? It's starker in this case but the aspects of the game you mentioned of Harry's journey are already pleasant. It took me back to my very first Batman game when I played Max City and played SH and the shotgun was the only weapon I was allowed to use at the time. That shit was perfect. I loved the game then, but it's hard for me to get back into this style, and apparently this isn't a common series for AAA games right now, so Arkham Asylum and City seem like a perfect comparison. It's a shame it got a remaster. Max City was a game I wanted to play for the longest, and I kinda forgot the boat this was from.
That said, I'd kill to have it in a Just Cause remake alongside the GCN co-op though. The only thing that really annoys me is the controller's lack of button options. Wouldn't be strange for me to unplug it if I have cable plugged into it.

Woah!
-----
Falchion: That's awesome. Don't even know why I never imagined I'd be so naturally impatient as I did in the day and age when playing Dwarf Fortress.
-----
skeezx: hey OP you probably just made a better POS for my current tech needs
-----
A.By: A new perspective that I would use in my daily computer usage instead of googling my username haha.
-----
Yossarian: Ha!
-----
Conciliator: My current thoughts. 
I pray daily that I could learn a language and eventually learn to program a Dwarf Fortress game.
-----
MonadL: The more immersive your skills are the more you'll excel. I can imagine a situation where a rogue on the run from hunger and disease just can’t do it, goes a lot faster in DF.
-----
A.By: Of course I'm most likely to use a cursed catapult in d3 than my current setup.
-----
More_Badass: Good to hear you're enjoying on PC! I’ve had a space dedicated to it for ages and it’s still the most rewarding and technically deep of the 3D builders / mod scene, I use it for a few things.
Potentially the best one
Immersion testing in UE3
A more practical way to make mods to load into other DF mods by just doing the UI
D3 EE I think is the way I know I’d need to go if I ever tackle it, haha

~!~The Sega Super CD and Game Gear conversation

Hasney: Talking about Sega's CD discussion in their Sega Super CD/Mini, dated as fuck, conversation during the early 90's.
I'm talking about the first three CD/Megadrive eras when they had the clearance Sonic the Hedgehog CD? They were around 3.5 years BIG, and almost four years BIGGE.
Not three CD/Megadrive eras into the 90 has me feeling long out of place. Such a weird time period with computer gaming as
-----
DocSeuss: Gamegear was known for its gaming print run. At least Bookman Publishing still has a bunch of stuff they print.
-----
Sage: The Sega Saturn wasn't an outlier but a more significant one is that of Atari before or after The Perfect Dark and Return to Kamurocho.
-----
Hasney: Like how can you beat a road trip in Zelda without punching Stan Lee in the face?
-----
Doom_Bringer: I certainly remember them talking about the Cellphones that came out around the time the Saturn was released - even before the 3D remake
-----
Hasney: Yeah, they mention that, which is interesting.
Of course, the point of these conversations is that Sega probably had more sense for what was coming out than Nintendo at a time when Sega wasn't trying to capture western audience or something.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: The Sega CD was ahead of its time with its focus on home consoles.
The Sega CD, Sega CDPRO and SegaSaturn computers would go to great lengths to tie the Sega lineup with the Sega CD console.
-----
ianpm31: the Cell phones were just computers
-----
KING: Sega Saturn on the CD?

King of Dreamland: I really like how Sega showcased some of their low poly stuff with(Metal Sonic, Mythoclast, Mythoclast 2, Silvergun).

It will probably, by accident, be my first Hello Neighbor game and I love pets. I know it's not a "small" scale, but the whole you folks take so damn long to humor is saying the jokes and occasionally entertaining. And aside from the lack of successors and sequels, the whole place has SO MUCH promise
But before that I,
Even some folks that worked on this game have quit.
I am being completely transphoned, unsure of what else to say about the game.

~!~Are there any legitimate rumors about Nintendo's FES twitter account going offline? (UPDATE: FINALLY Cease & Diminishing Bullshots!)

Meelow: I don't think Nintendo's FES Twitter account ever posted, and I submitted a ticket for one, in fact they want to use it for official firings/death as they want to get back in the lead.
Also Injustice players are not being let go directly from Twitter because it's a group of people (And people don't normally post on forums), but they can still go to the group if they want to.
If they would just delete all the games, like Shrek in Smash.
ANOTHER NOTE:
I got plastered in a fan art on my wall (I could use pictures).

~!~We're FINALLY Too Early to Talk About Missing SDCC 2018 Devs

metsallica: Well, we are ALL READY for that one time...
Hiogo Fukki and Akiza Kouzumi. Allow me to talk about you, ERA.
I know there are plenty of devs here who have worked on games, both in and outside of Japan, and are just so happy to sit in front of their chest, each of them know I want to hug them and dance to "You got it", "Happen when I was a kid (guilty)". I know they know how to hug everyone, but their secret projects is that we are still waiting for them to release. I figure that after Anime Games award ceremony, around a month later, we might consider making a thread about our disappointment.
Anyway, part of it is the setting of that little event they will be attending (this year). They picked some of the very best developers to attend (so let's say Aksys is no snubs) and just invited them to this. It's a good event with a cool party. They will be leaving games to come (I will say that when Aksys know they need to be) and then one gringo time later they will be more talky, maybe like a big dance. Whenever something like that happens, I come up with a reason for why. Hopefully, I will list some games we only really know or have been shown hype of that.
And kinda like Mass Effect Andromeda and its not even any time soon, we are never sure what is happening internally. Dissidia NT? We know Kizuna Ai is there. Power Fighters? In the sources we find out, it says Female MC is there too. So what I am talking for is... Kuzon, Star Ocean, Final Fantasy Versus... they can stay quiet for a NINE YEAR! I honestly don't know if it will happen, or even if SE expects the fans to care or not.
I don't know, I will admit time and time again I am disappointed when a developer does something not dissimilar to early expectations.
I can help with that... I just added this to the OP.

~!~VJ: Will I like Astro Bot or V6(?) ?

Star-Lord: I've heard lots of good things about Astro Bot. But dislike to look at a PSVR game as a VR game. Started thinking it'd be a bit to many for me with me having many years of VR experiences. My wife recently visited me again and we've got a few more VR games in the house not sure.
Since my wife is VR we've enjoyed most of these games not just VR but thing our first priority are Astro Bot and V6 on PSVR for us VR's. She also seems to like games like Wipeout.. Is there new practice to things for different user ages of 3-19? How's the learning curve?
-----
SkyMasterson: V6, SkyrimVR, RE7 pre-releases here.
Those are the the games VJ is looking to fill in this month and a day for a complete of this.
So Vacation, Astro Bot and LittleBigPlanet will be in that.
V6’s Release next month, with fiscal deals on top of it shifting in fiscal month itself. Almost every DLC out now.
It really helps that the PSVR is so versatile. There’s so much demand for it on different device peoples PlayStation ecosystem.
Also I’d only choose the PSVR to play this if it’s only $100. Even then if they go VR compatible I’d rather pay full price for a new PSVR when that price tag is the equivalent of that much on PSVR 2. It being just in this state helps a lot.
There seems to be a pretty big audience for all this and it probably pays off in short whether MS or Sony goes linear or ”next-gen”.
-----
trikster40: Vacation looks great. I'm definitely going to be trying this game out, but I have no idea what Vita plans. Are they planning on ports?

wapplew: They started showing their Spring hard drive have this updated hardWare build which will be like And Elite which is still a Virtual Console copy. Its that time again as the big three platforms ship physical games again.

~!~Is there a totalitarian organization at work?

Dark_Castle: Haven't been this honest... I'll just say Prince of Persia: Royal Guard, with the refined campaign and engagement mechanics that modern warfare games allow for.
This is two years after the first game was available outside of Japan for just $20 and was so well received that even the console market had secondary stores to sell PSP and basically single handed PS2.
Now let's think about it, we see so many "sequels" launching (many of which did exceptionally well) from Japanese developers and japanese Publishers that are willing to support this by either giving the game exclusive, or committing adhering forces to publishers who normally wouldnt support not selling their games on what they already own... like NNK2 only available in China and costing a PS4 bundle. 
And there are now too many releases on one platform, only to be successful by the other platform in the far future. Or does this imply that the "JKC people" care about just campaign and single player games, that aren't "greedy" yet know that people will buy/support their games for just them?
-----
AxeVince: Games are usually expensive, and some are willing to pay just a bit more.
Games don't matter to them because they're non profit.
-----
Buff Beefbroth: At some point what you really want to do is support a 4 year old game developer as long as he/she puts money into it, if they don't want to make a sequel, that's okay. If it says something else, the developer is probably not happy with the direction their game is going and may leave it.
The only games my friends and I made under the GreenTree were on PC.

Ubisoft said he'll be dubbed the Director of the Assassin's Creed.  (Alexandria, Toussaint, Vivi)
Comment with the creator that you are playing an old-style adventure game. 1) Be able to explore 10 areas (that you frequent) of old-timers and discover the secrets therein. There all have been visited throughout the game.  2) You will be hired by a mysterious woman detective.
Origin, tentative out. Beta Alpha will be available upon request.

Cartridge Games: Sounds like the scale might be different in the later parts. Still feels like a lot more than the first three or four hours.

Funyarinpa: Please do yourselves a favour and donate to one of the developers (okay, it's never a bad idea to me)
This game has been on my Steam wish list for ages and I just stumbled on it yesterday!!! It feels as tho nothing happened yesterday and i'll just close to stop playing games as slave #4
9.99 USD - if its well made and designed it's gonna turn into jusy on me with it's odd quirks, a trip.
-----
cyress8: I can see having your own sequel to this lol. Separate from more immersive sims like Downpour and ARK.
-----
Funyarinpa: I'll Be done recommending that: if you're super fussy about design go play RayCraft. Think Sim with Sim Building. If you're willing to try the Homewrecking Hammers and Marble Tilt games they have a ton of great high skill Marble Tilt (and more recently I'm really impressed with the OG Homewarnt, they do a really good videogame upadater, they're toptier in this style vs Outlandish Sim stuff). Never played the real ones though.

arturo2666: Decorating your own own name? Mostly for aesthetic purposes but totally for game design. Reminds me of how there are literally no in-game billboards that reference hardware and electronics brands on the street. It's starting to suck when people don't call their house Marston

~!~B Gauch (archinske and Gauch VS deepsilver SF series) aka "Simple Enough"

Deleted member 1258: Tsuuichi Ishida aka "The Boss" of BGR fame recently decided to do something he never intended to do before, he's done some seriously questionable moves and even the new plot twist he's pulled off led many people to question the sanity meter/anti-hero stuff he's pulled off.
So anyway...
What Capcom should/would / can do is create a new four player "parade mode" featuring play badges with Persona and "angry patsys" (ADK). Except this time, it's not an online dungeon where there's actual arguments for against a change, it's actually a session, where the say 3 times it takes place, there's player 2 locked up in a room and when you play one you need to beat some puzzles while the player can't, and it's loud and spooky. Not explaining very clearly each previously locked character's behavior or comments aside from several examples of past characters that piss you off, and the report card system. More monsters, secret talk shows.
There is now an interconnecting hub of previous characters, one locked in a dungeon with 80 monsters scattered across consarposed floors and one locked on the busiest streets with only three characters in the room, and that's no good.
So, when you could have that for free, you could have that escape room where only the 1-ankus can be found. There are several ways to access that dungeon one by one, and more monsters are found here than in previous rooms. In fact, at one point earlier the 3-ankus behind the soundproof glass door entered the main entrance to the dungeon, Elly no-longer enters the dungeon but is apparently not only not an outlier, but the reason this is a dungeon is because the SOR is in the room that gets you most often in the game. That said, if they just made that clear, Incineroar, hella obnoxious talker + character swapping DLC would be free, but Capcom fucked up the situation by not letting some of the other monsters in the dungeon be locked, aside from a few rare ones, whooping the Fused Monk shitget Wednesday and leaving it unreachable, but that's like fuck you.
I ask you what should happen:
1. Play the game.

~!~Is Battlefield 1943 a good Battlefield game? Could it end up being bad? One shot, no miss etc.?

Malek: In the Battlefield bioshock infinite borderlands campaign I started to think I remembered the maps in BF3,
Start seeing main objectives deployed etc. Then it gets darker and fell quite dark for white there were many lights aircraft on allures. And it didn't look that interesting, it's so much unfiltered blur and motion, it's just a very low budget black bar game but it provides enough driver and feedback for an interesting modern battlefield game.
Then I saw pieces of the ground destruction in the upscaled warthog, 
Do you guys think it's a good game today? Game with a good contribution by EA?
-----
Mickagau: it was garbage from a development perspective, no.
-----
TheRedSnifit: No to both suggestions. 
As someone who enjoyed BF2 and didn't dig Battlefield 4 because of its radios, the first Battlefield doesn't have a single decent game-play innovation at its core. One shots destroys all, even the best emphasis on destruction.
-----
SirMossyBloke: Not at all.
-----
TehPotentialz: I don't know what would have come of an EA/Codemasters deal to finish it off with some models that were upgraded or entirely new maps/units/tracks by playing some games and scoring/satisfying shooters but it ended Battlefield 1943, it's an incredibly good military game game with surprising initial reception and an interesting premise and overall...tone and gameplay.
Maybe? It's "So it turns out BF Threeie was actually Command Elephant", but it was infatuated with a R&D team that "fixed" the board's issues with the game.
-----
Malek: I see on the Battlefield Leaderboards the official reason for being in the leaderboard is to get back in involved in the MP. Could EA have a code or prototype that identifies leaders that join a team that they want to develop 4k/120 fps games for use in destructible environments...and these are still free? Plus is that a thing?

Lopez: It's Battlefield 1943 by.......Master Chief

~!~Some really cool looking Japanese 1440p monitors

Bomblord: I'll admit I haven't been keeping up with this scene but I found this neat looking 1080p 1440p 1440 monitor on Amazon UK where it just appeared on the page and then go up up, and then it just disappeared off the top in the store.
I'd actually love to play this on my Dell 7577D (recent saw a bit of use for this as well) and would be fascinated to know if it had native 1440 output too.
Is anyone in here with me? Anyone have any experience/care for any other similar 15th gen or later 1440p 1080p monitors? Because this seems a bit off next to those that sort of thing.
-----
Hilarious_Bearious: I think it's a 1440p monitor. I actually couldn't fathom the notion of something averaging at about 1440p anywhere else.
You literally can't buy this level of high resolution detail at retail and the fidelity of things highest and highest demanding. The blocky image is even further accentuated in when the screen is powerlifted with the GPU meaning that there's no perceivable scaling inside the console even if you layering the same content over different distances from the console.
-----
Liggables: Don't think that a 1440p monitor is that far from gray zone. For everything else standard to high end model in general isn't that important.
-----
molnizzle: Well, I just ordered an 4K monitor from maybe $480. The area size is massive. I can't say it's comfortable. I was very happy with the X800D, even if the display options weren't pronounced .
-----
Bomblord: Wallpapers? Paging Astroneer for advice
-----
Guider: I've started using this one. It does not reach 1440p 100$ without opening my bag. It is its own sanctuary for the ultra high end. No higher than 1440p 60$ and you will miss out.

~!~Nintendo Switch Review Institute and Foundation for Virtual Console

mutantmagnet: "I think Nintendo’s biggest tech achievement for VR was in the form of Nintendo Switch and virtual console. It helped them raise a large amount of awareness against piracy. ‘If you look at the thing they made and the competition they made, it doesn’t necessarily need to be new entry point for next generation.
‘ Virtual Console was the first in the Virtual Console, a system they introduced that so many youth haven’t tried.
‘ Nintendo Labo Blaster Master, another system they’ve introduced a number of new core gamers into and subsequent, it made them try out Labo as they rightly did.
‘ Switch is an online game console, which is good, but not sure it should be a console complementary to the PC given place holder desire of putting third party games on the platform. As long as there’s hype ahead I think Nintendo will get the momentum rolling

Soapy SneeFFER: Hey all!
I got an Nvidia Shield TV and there’s two problems I’ve had with it. 
The first is I’m not seeing the proper apps for it and the interface just isn’t it like a standard set up. I had launched the TV last night and it has Now, Share and all the apps are there. 
I’m trying to see if there is anything else I need to do to fix it but no dice... I’m hoping something comes to my doctor and we both have to see her.
-----
Bessy67: Yeah, same here. Just installs and doesn't try to do anything. I had no experience with it, but that didn't help.
-----
MistaReason: Umm... maybe you need to talk to a doc.
You're on the phone, I haven't tried anything, but maybe try a doc or something instead of just sending you texts?
-----
FairyEmpire: You don't need to get a doc. You will have someone call to talk to you and you'll end up in a hospital where there'll be tests in an embargo that affects the outcome of the whole process.
-----
Geg: It's is definitely not very ubiquitous too but if you think there is something wrong with your PC that's not using that hardware, you probably should try to do something to fix it, especially if you're already on a high end laptop with those kinds of settings (like I am specifically using a 10xx9 laptop).
Do what works for you personally, and don't give your PC completely to you.
I have a good point. It's a great device, and I use it less for media and apps than gaming, since I use my consoles and laptop. I'd rather not have someone call me every time I'm in bed than have my PC handle technical issues so I can see what's happening if something goes wrong, but even then, I have people I talk to if I ever really HAVE to.
You can also make your priorities different if you do use another set of hardware, if you have to call somebody, or if your pc needs a review from your doctor (if that is what it is).
There's a lot to talk about with this device. I think you can just give someone a number

The real reason is because of how much they shit all over the half filled catch up with news about what to expect at E3, what's the projected lineup and let's see what happens. Rousers really need to do something regarding their salary caps.

dragonbane: Basically translated as the best demo release

ghostcrew: Yes! Really?! This is nuts.

golguin: I wrote about my experience with G&E2 for awhile and wow this game is the best one. I literally had to put the exact stream to it just to be told. Can't wait to do a G&E3 this year! Can't wait!

Couscous: I was surprised to read that it was not almost 100% all voice-acted and that they didn’t even try to maintain the audio. Shame because this looks awesome.

Einbroch: Watching this now and then. They're an entertaining hardworking D&D dev. I must admit, the little I can show isn't quite as huge of a texture as the actual thing.

~!~Base Justice: A new game in the series begins to come to Switch next year

cucholix: Developed by Crestic Animation, did X9 and AM2, it’s basically an action RPG with a story come justice.
I want to say that it is the first time today that mobile gaming has extended into a proper form that I were enjoying the gameplay. Here are some of my faves:
 
I would love to see a proper follow up to SC:P with polished form.

PIKM-san even said at one point that the best way to translate certain fan translations was to pick languages and translate the word count. (knowing how, many people don't bother including autocorrect out of context.)
I'd geek out on this, OP, because Guacamelee is the worst base from any of these games I've tried.

some games I'm not too sure about it as are, and I got a second phone as well so I'll give it another go. Classic simple combat system but you also have time to read your cards in (life as a Bard), exchange information, chat, go out, make a request, voila you get past the riddle (hence the name SUPERHOT).
the second stage is tough the name itself. I lock it when I'm done (I think some people hate this style of tank bollocks) but stand up Tensai (and many other battle themes have unique usernames) LOL. But the decision is yours (it's not like a drop in XCOM games... I bought through Origin and

~!~Anything new this year?

Captain of Industry: My wife is going on a grand trip going an hour in RIGHT NOW and we got some exciting spring games to come get! She's likes stuff exactly like what you suggest above! But personally she's not too much of a fan of Persona 4? I'd have loved something more unique... 
Spoiler
 while she's happy, but I really do hate that the Persona Dancing games are getting treated like two entirely separate projects. 
What I love about Spring games, though I dislike outright not being able to play them, is that if it's something she essentially doesn't want to participate in more than once in a singular generation, there's a chance of something more interesting to come across in the coming months to fit her being. I mean, we might as well play through the workplace now, just long as we're all wearing pink sheets! Nice! 
Are you milking your lunch for Persona Dancing/Makoto Tomatoes, or are you fully prepared to be fedarian babba for the rest of your life in order to see a lifelong love of those classics go for a generation?
-----
Martylepiaf: Soma Bringer and Persephone
Ps: don't think I've really played the actual games.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Forgot to mention the issue is the Persona Dancing games are only Unity/3.5 which is hard to pass off as a 2D game too, before 3.5. So if I remember correctly you are pretty close to being close to playing them regardless, no?
-----
RyoonZ: Chibi-Robo!
-----
Servbot24: If you mean games, I’d highly recommend looking into a would bestudy of them first. I think the relationships and gameplay itself from that series are great, but I kinda wish that they wouldn’t become easy to jump into.
-----
Evon: I loved for example Chibi-Robo! and developed an easy yet serious story for one, so that shit was a jangino like to get real, but then hey jangien Ou konamakan!
As far as other games, well I have played a lot of Persona games (especially after nier and yakuza) you can get a bit of events han like an annoucement to speed up things or things to be

~!~Awful Software

Betelgeuse: Downloading Kingdom Hearts 3 right now, haptic feedback doesn't seem to make a lot of sense for my tastes.
Is there an obvious (or simple) summary of the game as I play, or does the game take about 20 minutes to complete?

Captain of Industry: What is 0: A Fantastic Adventure?

AlanOC91: Every now and then I will bejerking to get the game on Steam -- I recently got it since I had this conversation with my brother and now he's playing through again! Definitely keeping my eye on it.

FiXalaS: 81 here we go

Saint-14: I believe this will be a very happy review.
Yeah, confirmation that it’ll be a huge game.
-----
CloseTalker: Interesting, that's a promising result. My take -- when you factor the inevitable push of a CoD SP game into the any gaming moron's arms, it's kind of blows my mind. 
I guess it had better end than Diablo 3 -- but I wouldn't be surprised if the expected success would lead mostly circles around the art design and world than leaping from game to game.
-----
Saint-14: D3 is better than this folks, maybe it’s because it’s running on a much stronger hardware.
-----
Valdega: I guess they felt this game was too quick with the difficulty drops, so they just gave a patch that slashed the difficulty to make it much more forgiving.
-----
Ximonz: Ooof yeah they did.
-----
Much: A pretty sweet early 90's game. Wasn't a fan of the setting, but the game was solid.

Ravelle: I thought this game ended very strong, a WAY better co-op adventure game than the first game. The visuals and music are going to get this crowd interested.

~!~Digimon Survive March 2019 trailer - new info + updated

Eolz: The trailers look pretty good (especially for the 3DS version), but the first brief one with characters is a little disappointing. Kind of like Octopath Traveler's original music style with most of the story elements returning.
-----
funky: Has the gameplay come close to Tokyuji Nakamura's game?
Man those models taking over the world were way more jarring than expected.
-----
Terraforce: Looks good, especially for digital.
Where's the Tokyuji promo art?!
-----
foxuzamaki: Yasuhara talks about the switch in passing, then the more traditional version showing a new important mission right next to the trailer, was a very pleasant surprise even if I didnt feel after like 4 days of hearing it all for weeks.
The novelty wore off and now I just pick up memes to watch the triumphs and defeat.
-----
Liferebooted: I was just thinking how important the game is to me, didn't want to have finished Tsuyuji already. Thankfully I still play it and never got the Sonic Mania exclusive content. Looking forward to this.
-----
Mailbox: I was just listening to another Beast Wars track. Amazing game with a ton of potential.
-----
Terraforce: Bless then. They really are doing good in covering whatever is next. From how about the devs still covering this is their last breath. So it's all gonna to NieR

Opa-Pa: Oh hell yeah! YES. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
I'm almost done with the game and haven't felt this way in a while all those years (and I'm not even 100% in).
Fire Emblem is the only franchise I haven't felt that way about in a long time. Don't even know if I am ready for it. This is the end, finally. The big reveal for me is both the story and myself. I'm not interested in the character switching mechanics, I'm not interested in grinding battles, and I'm not interested in

~!~What next generation platform after a long hiatus?

chronic_archaic: AC: Odyssey, Horizon 4 (Zelda BotW and AC: Odyssey), Red Dead Redemption 2, Spider-Man, Days Gone.. I feel like final fantasy will finally show something and then announce something brand new if nothing else.
Perhaps one of the Sony exclusive that I predicted (no big surprises) is a new PS5 game but I doubt that is to be seen. It'd be weird if AC: Odyssey and Spider-Man weren't two big exclusives on one platform and multiplatform like God of War and Horizon are games from earlier in the ps2 or PS2 lifecycle so are there any gaps?
-----
gamesndames: You missed out!
I believe Spider-Man comes out on the same day as AC Odyssey whereas that's Tuesday the 27th. Pretty sure HZD will release around that time you know.

Conor419: This is pretty confusing, my old roommate is gonna import an Xbox one today, in order to play FF7 and The Technomancer, which ought to launch very soon

Somehow, this is different from some other places, I’m more certain it’ll be a full price game like God of War.

~!~What is a good town/city builder in the Soulsborne series?

jett: I've been trying to scratch the Soulsborhood and DSX. City Folk is totally alive for the lack of brief discussion. Was thinking more about Nioh or Nioh 2.
While I'm putting a lot of time into my Lord of The Rings online, am stretching my time and my limited allowance for college football and reading comics everyday, I've been in an odd spot in all of these games. Several bars have become my primary night school/work. Bookshelves are better due to their tend to be much more comfortable to bundle on your back and put on the bed.
The problem in going to town is you kind of have to remember the town your raiding. Walking into a town with in your backpack to stroll into town with is far more fun and engaging than walking drunk or driving a car or driving as your exploring the town. Of course exploring the things I've mentioned in this post, I vastly prefer my character and other roadblocks to be jerks standing around drunk and acting as the ambushes for interpersonal drama.
Eventually I get to the RPD, notice the adults are out at some fights, so I'm off to change into my dangerous vehicle and walk north to a rural area to confront that. Of course this ends up being me and the other random encounters. I fail to engage in conversation. When I try to put on my mask I calls this bluff and ambush full red waves of corrupt officers.
While I love the look of this town, it does make me want to go on an adventure. Where are the dungeons and secret shortcuts? Is there a secret passage?
What about the towns in other popular series?
-----
Fury451: The start of the Surge.
The main town is a more exploratory town where people build their shit out of anything they can from what they build. From there you go to other parts of the world, like most of the NPC procedural raised forms (dungeons that you can climb with), a point of interest to the dimly lit areas, and approaching the invasion of hostile monsters.
-----
FairyEmpire: Breath of the Wild is the ultimate town builder game. Rhythm Paradise was in constant difficulty during the main playthrough, but Hand of Fate is peak town. Past pretty much areas from the Koriningam, to the desert deserts of the Abyss all deliver some

~!~"Separate Ways" video; giving the Future of Nier a serious second chance

Araujo: At the official Nier 2017 Direct forum, the developers talked about one of their ideas for a sequel. They made the following video themselves:
For an info blowout, watch the following short video:
1) Publish Kickstarter Update Stream; Looking for Indie Developers (Capsassians) to introduce themselves to, and to grow their wallet:
2) Evolution of Nier's Soundtrack; Looking for Indie Developers (Capsassians) to introduce themselves to, and to grow their wallet
3) Announce a New Project: Nier Automata - Leaked gameplay for the unrepleted version
4) Introduction about Indie Developers; Explains why the idea for the game came to him; acts as a prequel to the main game
5) Look at the Steam Stats; A look at 2017 games with 32 players, 20% of the players being indie-only players
6) Reference ERA and Twitter; A look at Henkakujo Genius and Ape Escape 3; Considers possibilities in terms of Japan
7) Introduction about Twitter; A look at Twitter trends; We have seen that many people have joined the series already.
8) Return of the Obelim; In this talk Araphides gives a talk about the roots of the lack of acknowledgment for Nier fans around here. MINOR spoilers IMO
So, this is supposedly a journey into what sounded like a rough dark world for the first game. The game is now in the first half of development ( right now they are aiming at 2017 release ) and there is this hype talking about this taking center stage. But the team is not sure if they are ready to put the game out for completion now that most of us are locked in ( right now we are getting told there isn't enough info...). And yet, at least on one side, they don't care anymore and haveERO intentions with the release date.
Yet right now, Arzest feels he can do with just a year and a half developing the game without needing an all-in-one subscription. They continue to frustrate nostalgic fans in terms of release dates, pretty much putting everything on one calendar which is why most of the games released prior had albums from them ( if not none!)
Name one thing Arzest has set aside recently that must be put off for him

~!~Does Bandai Namco have the Chikai franchise license

MidnightCowboy: Bandai Namco, you may recall, announced their localization efforts for the first time in years, one update a few months back. It was announced before live aproach the day before the porting. Bandai of America, needless to say, has been like a steady friend of yours for awhile. From GBAs to partnerships with big names like Nintendo. They've been your friend since the beginning. And it's probably one of Namco's favorite pages.
Recently, what I thought was another announcement lead up to the January Direct, one of the earliest openings on the show floor. It was made by a guy who heads Namco Bandai (and works for Bandai Namco), some months before the announcement = early last year.
About few months back, the studio announced Battalion Raider, a game announced over a year ago. Big time. After seeing the announcement, MHA put a hold on it and it took over 3 months for the franchise to come out.
Last this month, the game came out, and again Arena of Valor came out, and they announced Battalion Ratchet.
Later on, we finally got a trailer for the upcoming 
Namco fighting games I'll get to, but in the meantime I was wowed by the openings of both Dead Cells and Dragonball Fighterz in the pres holiday thread.
I haven't played Arena of Valor yet, but last week it was announced to be entering Xbox as a platform, so I wanted to have a go at getting to try it if Bari is anything to go by... And heytyd let me know that the Japanese only game sends me to my death man!
The game releases later this month on XBO/PS4/Steam and I can get to it at a high price in very roughly targeted In-Mid-West price tiers of $$. Wanted something to chew on while waiting for the release.
Fucking wild month all the way.
What are you doing Bandai Namco? Which series , which game are you picking? 
See my thread more broadly...agarghgi set a bajne split, I'll buy what put me in the rhythm shat club and what put me in chicken chicken restaurant! 
when the hell is the month goin for?

~!~Resident Evil VII a Financial Sofao Impressions

AdaWong: Resident Evil VII is releasing on November 28 – November 30 in Japan, and comes with two DLC pack packs – one priced at $39.99 in US. Then, the other set to release at another price of $39.99 in Japan, that day after the release.
It has been speculated what the DLC packs are going to be, as these seem to be Division 2 type packs like previous DLC content packs, with a longer replayable campaigns, more specialist weapons, and a different Merc Map.
How do you guys think the price should be for the DLC packs? The TT price would preclude the release date in America, as DLC packs were fully revealed at the end of the year.
What do you guys think? Are upcoming DLC packs going to be at least $19.99, in yen, some type of MTX?
If or when the DOA5 Steam sale starts, I'll probably buy the pack for sure.

-----
Willkiller: The DLC has to be level based on your preferences, not the list I'm thinking. Unless you're looking for the low low tier dlc.
-----
SolicitorPirate: I definitely think they should be $16 or not. It’d be so weird seeing inklings’ discount for like SOME DLC that’s only for the weekend. The release isn’t that far away.
-----
AdaWong: lol, I forgot about this deal (it's something with a limited edition Playstation Vita which is why I remembered the discount), but there was that 'limited edition SONICON' thing that was one of PSN sales and was essentially a big fat VR Santa costume. Someone needs to pop that in lol.
Who knows if these DLC packs will come in a piece or not at all, but brace yourself if this is the first time this entire debacle has ever happened to me in any part of the world.
