~!~The Legend of Zelda Series Announced for Switch (as part Nintendo Direct)

vestan: Didn't see a thread for this but this was announced during Nintendo's direct. Looks like a summoning of sorts between Link and the Champions. It's a very unique title and I'm pretty sure that it's not just coming to Switch. I just did a Switch quickplay (no online unfortunately) and it looks like it'll work.
-----
NKnight7: Nice.
-----
the lizard: I read the title as "The Legend of Zelda Spin".
-----
NotLiquid: Cool. I'll play it
-----
Phantom Thief: I'm so fucking in
-----
TheRaidenPT: I! I! I! I! I!
-----
Mediking: HOLY SHIT
-----
Kinsei: Link and the Champions are back.
-----
brokeastronaut: Yesssss
-----
TheRaidenPT: I was starting to get really interested in this game. Will I actually get to experience the Champion again?

~!~RDR II: Tracking and Horse Comparison - NXGamer

Dr. Caroll: NXGamer has done a great job compounding the new gameplay with a well-deserved new video.
-----
TheGhost: I was hoping to see some horse tracking from the new CB back in October.
-----
Xando: Exciting!!
-----
Heshinsi: NXGamer is one of the best videos.
I hope they upload the rest soon.
-----
Kurdel: Wow, nice!
-----

Dr. Caroll: By the way, the original RockStar's general manager, Stefanification (Budget Director): 
What's the deal with the horse tracking on Pro and X1X?
-----
CaviarMeths: Ooof, I thought this was already done. Fingers crossed.
-----
Cess007: Nice, I was just about to post this!
-----
texhnolyze: Oh nice! I love that you've made a video on this!

~!~The under representation of Final Fantasy VI in Smash Bros Ultimate

NotLiquid: This was something I was thinking about after I replayed Final Fantasy VI on the Wii U Virtual Console. I remember it was announced and a lot of people were very excited, but it still didn't have quite the same reach as Smash Bros.
It seems like FFVI in a good way to try to capture the same audience FFVI had at the time, especially when it comes to Wii U.
How the hell did FFVI's director do so well, but with Square-Enix and Capcom's previous titles being ignored? It seems like Square-Enix was really in charge of what was going on in the game, and they knew that if we wanted to have a good game, we'd have to be a FF.
-----
Platy: They are not doing FF =O
By ignoring FFVI at this point they are saying that they will not include it in Smash Bros
-----
NKnight7: I'm glad the game is considered well over its prime time phase.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: The director is a fucking dog
-----
Vicious17: Square-Enix is working on FFVII Remake?
-----
Platy: It is possible to have a good proportion of FFV on the Switch.
There is still a small minority of fans who say that FFVI is not good enough.
-----
The Almighty Tria: It's a bad game. It's not even a bad game.
-----
Nanashrew: Capcom didn't just decide to not include the game in Smash Bros.
-----
Jawmuncher: Yep. 
Still don't know if Square even knows. It's a pretty big deal if you ask me.
-----
Nemesis162: That's not true. I think they're not even considering FFVI.

~!~ARMS Party Crash: Min Min vs. Mis Min vs. Spring Man vs. Springtron; Party Crash coming to Switch on March 12

Neoxon: Also, Mis Min vs. Spring-Top is getting a new badge.
Source: Nintendo (Twitter)
-----
Neoxon: The Party Crash is indeed a new Party Crash.
-----
jefjay: Soooo...how many of you are gonna play this?
-----
TheMink: I'm a bit hesitant on this one as it doesn't seem like a MOBA.
-----
Parvaati: I was able to play the first one with a friend. It was pretty fun.
-----
Kokonoe: Oh hell yes. I need this game.
-----
jefjay: Yeah, I'm really keen for this one. I really hope they don't kill themselves by releasing this on cartridge.
-----
Neoxon: It's the party crash of the second game, so no.
-----
SparksterMeta0: Wow. I really hope this one comes to the Switch. Played the first one.
-----
Mediking: Wow. Min Min vs. Mis Min.

~!~Forza Horizon 4 new roadblocks are deaths and I'm done

wwm0nkey: Just got finished with the game and thought I'd give it a try and see if I enjoy it or not.
So I finally got to Australia and the weekend reoween session started and all I get for tuning in to play the game I'm playing is a mixture of having to see what your driving option is before selecting the map.
So far this mode has been really fun but after about 5 hours I'm having a hard time getting into it. The car selection to select the weather etc has felt lacking.
All in all I'm having a really hard time getting into it. I don't have much incentive to tune in.
So far I'm liking what I'm seeing so far but a friend of mine got stuck on a wire at high speed. I'm not sure how to fix that, maybe get around to playing as though I'm actually down to ply BOTW off and on or just play BOTW in handheld mode.
So yeah I'm done with this game.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I remember being super impressed with the first one.
-----
Rocketz: I'm in the same boat too. The first one is a disappointment and I think will get a better refund if mixed with a buggy release. 
I'll just need to see how it plays in handheld mode before I dive in.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I think that probably has something to do with the fact that the last BOTW trailer was 9 months ago.
-----
Silky: The game has been buggy and the sims are not the best thing to see in gaming.
-----
wwm0nkey: Forgot to mention that I am playing the new game plus and I love driving around. I was enjoying it a lot but the lack of actual fast travel just made me drop it.
-----
wwm0nkey: A friend of mine mentioned that the driving option is not final. I was thinking it's a huge feature that should be in the game, that you just get to pass by things you should know to use.

====================
~!~So what's the deal with game sharing?

LossAversion: I just got a PS4 for Spider-Man, and I'm signed up for the same service. I'm wondering what's the deal with game sharing. I was able to download the entire Spider-Man PS4 disc (which I already had but I wanted to salvage it). I downloaded the game for a few weeks when it first came out and had a few hours of fun playing it with a friend.
I know there are other ways to play the game but what's the deal with game sharing? I don't think it's a console or PC.
-----
Kenzodielocke: The deal with game sharing is that the games are also digital exclusive to PS4. 
So, I imagine a deal with Nintendo is better than a deal with Microsoft.
-----
LossAversion: I'd rather have that than having a completely separate account with all the options. If I'm playing a game through PS Plus and need to delete the game and then need to download a bunch of mods and stuff from the internet then that's even worse. It's better to have the option to download the game from the internet and play than not having the disc.
-----
LossAversion: I understand the idea is to allow games to be made to share the share button but I'm wondering if there's any benefit to having multiple account for the game or if it's better to just make sure I'm logged in on both.
-----
BubbleButt64: I've been trying to find a way to prevent others from doing this for years now. I just signed up for the same service and all the games I'm having fun with are there.
-----
BubbleButt64: I'll ask him to get his account banned then lol

CloseTalker: I'm excited to see how this runs and how well it does.
-----
dieter: I'm not even going to watch the video, I just need to see the first 3 levels.
-----
ghostcrew: I am very interested in this. I also have the PS4 version. Is it worth picking up? I’d love to try the beta since it’s pretty expensive.
-----
Kaako: I'm excited to see what these guys are up to. I'll be playing this game for sure.
-----
Sir Guts: I played the first one a bit and it was fun but super buggy so I haven’t started it yet. But I’m ready to play the beta
-----
Kaiser Swayze: I'm curious about the combat, the world and such. Will keep an eye on this.

~!~RTTP: Mass Effect 3

JaeCryo: After finishing up my backlog last year I decided to finally dive into the series. I'd heard that ME3 is one of the best in the franchise and thought it was about damn time I played it. The setting is a hot mess, the dialogue is a bit dry but the atmosphere is sooo good and the banter between the cast of characters is great.
I'm about 9 hours in but only really starting to get behind the wheel of the game. First up is my old favorite character, Commander Shepard. I've been liking what I've gotten so far but I'm starting to get a little lost. I've mostly focused on the game's over the top humor. This is the fourth or fifth playthrough but I think it's starting to get more interesting.
Most of the plot points I liked were:
-The Ship, the Citadel and the Prydwen. All of these were fun and had some fun uses for humor. They were generally well done and had nice writing, I had a nice time with Commander Shepard and his companions even though I was a letdown at times.
-The side missions were fun and had some interesting ideas. The best part of the side missions was the exploration of the side consequences and the optional puzzles you could do. I was not expecting much from them, but was pleasantly surprised that they all worked pretty well. I'd say the best part of the side missions was the dialogue choices. I had to read their minds and get my ass handed to me in order to figure out what sort of answers to get, it's honestly amazing how much this allows to me. Every single sentence of dialogue was just so intriguing and I loved hearing how characters grew and had more agency in their lives. It's a shame that the final mission with the Sovereign was kind of the last thing I played before bed.
-The music was amazing. I absolutely loved the use of saxophone. It really added to the emotional part of the game. It fits the mood of the story so well.
-The Prydwen are the best. I would put the credit for the last 3 runs at least 6 or so hours in before going to their side missions. I think that's pretty much the shortest and most enjoyable. They were a pleasant surprise.
The 4 side missions that I liked were:
- Citadel
- Other
- Sovereign
- Other
- Sovereign

~!~I've finally been granted the privilege of playing through the entire Kingdom Hearts series on the XB1 BC store. Help me spend my free $20 on the XB1 collections!

daTRUballin: So I've finally been granted the privilege of playing through the entire Kingdom Hearts series on the XB1 BC store on my Xbox 360. I've been playing the whole series at this point but have never actually finished all of them? I'm curious what Era thinks about this.
Off the top of my head I'm a completionist about these games. Kingdom Hearts is one of my favorite video games ever and I've always been curious how they've handled JRPG mechanics.
I'd love to be able to play these games on the XB1 BC store with my save file.
-----
Ratchetdude231: I'm in the same boat, but I've been going through them all over the last year and just really want to get to playing them. I just wanna see the 4 games that came out in 2000 in one form or another, and I know that's a tough place to be going through all the different collections that are out there. I'm currently thinking about starting a collection of the Dream Team games instead, but I've had a lot of trouble with deciding on that.
-----
Dreamboum: I would like to play them at some point, I don't know if I have to spend money on the collection tho since I have the same console, but some of you guys might be right.
-----
XandBosch: I think you should own the games for as long as you can. I don't think you should own them for a long time, but it really helps.
-----
Bakercat: I'm in the same boat as you OP. I've been through them all over. I've taken my time with em and always have. I just wanna be sure I'm not the only one.
-----
Carassius Auratus: I have two collections left, and I've already bought the first. I don't know if I can start a collection in a few days, but I'll start one day.
-----
XandBosch: I don't want to start a collection with only 1 game. I'd rather not have to start a collection until all the games are out and available for me to play.

~!~So what's next for the Trails series?

SantaC: The Trails Series was a huge success on the PS2. They had a hit on the PS4 with chibi exemples. They had a hit with the anime. They also hit a home run in that anime series called Trails of Zero.
Now the Trails series is coming back. But what about the next entry?
I think it's safe to say that the next entry will be a sci-fi game. They have a sci-fi protagonist, they have a futuristic character. They have a lot of characters that are not your usual anime tropes. They have a huge protagonist with a lot of choices that can change based on what choices you make.
I think the next game will be a combination of the anime and the story.
-----
Balfour: I would say so
-----
Mediking: I dunno.. something is not in the works but are they working on a new anime franchise? I would say it's very likely. We haven't had any good examples of them going back to their youth.
-----
Ouroboros: I hope we get to hear some more about the Trails series after Trails in the Sky is finished.

~!~What mode are you using? (Darkest Dungeon, Diablo, Spore...)

borges: I've been playing Darkest Dungeon for a few weeks and I'm loving it. It's a very unique dungeon crawler with a lot of interesting and interesting ideas.
I've been playing D&D and DnD and I'm loving it.
I've been playing:
Spore
Diablo
Path of Exile
Unberst
Path of Exile 2
What I'm looking for is:
A darker, grittier game with a bit more depth to it.
Are there any other mode you'd like to see in the game?
-----
Cocolina: I play Darkest Dungeon and Diablo, but I also play Darkest Dungeon for the coop

Velord: I play Darkest Dungeon and Diablo on PC, but I've been playing the most recent and only just started with DQ XI.

Velord: Oh yeah I'm playing DQ11 on PC with a controller.
-----
Kuro: I play Darkest Dungeon on PC and PS4
-----
Cocolina: Oh I could watch that on Youtube
-----
Nyxeria: I play Darkest Dungeon on PC and PS4 and I also use a controller if its something thats more immersive or requires more buttons than m/kb
-----
Lozange: Darkest Dungeon. I love that game to death, every time I start one I am thinking: "I wonder what dungeon this would be?"

wwm0nkey: Tagging for OP as possible: 
The flight tests will be conducted on a live, server based test server called MCC Flight 2. Live test server will be launched on June 25, 2019 and will be used for the launch of Halo: MCC in 2019.

wwm0nkey: So is Live Test server going to be limited to specific servers again?
-----
Shaquille Hunter: I mean I expected that. I hope they can test this LAN LAN LAN.
-----
Cranster: Interesting! Looking forward to see what LAN LAN LANs can do.
-----
wwm0nkey: LAN LAN LAN LANs are not viable in LAN LAN unfortunately, you need a LAN gateway or something like that.
-----
Dancrane212: I wonder if this means we’ll get at least one version of Halo 5 with MCC before we get to see what’s new.
-----
chandoog: Is the MCC Insider build still active or is it just for now?
-----
wwm0nkey: The Insider build is still active, but the full release will be closer to release. Might give you a heads up if you want to wait for Halo to come out before you install MCC.

~!~Street Fighter V Arcade Edition Has Been Receiving Quite a Lot of Support

Scotia: I've been playing SFV for what feels like almost a year and a half now and I'm still very excited to play it.
Inexplicably, the game still suffers from severe technical issues that keep many people away. The input lag is a problem, the joystick is a dreadful input lag compared to the SF30 and SF30th Edition, the roll-back doesn't work properly, the shoulder buttons and shoulder buttons can't even roll properly, the shoulder buttons render the image instead of properly rendering the actual game.
These things are not easily fixed. Capcom has promised to fix them but I really hope that's not the problem.
Here's hoping Capcom fixes the other issues along with the visual issues.
-----
trugs26: I have this and I can't even play SFV anymore. I don't get the lack of inputs. 
It's pretty damn bad.
-----
Syril: I feel like I'm not playing a Street Fighter game if I don't know about the input lag. I'll never play a Street Fighter game for that.
-----
Jawmuncher: I’d say the input lag is probably more noticeable on Default or Revan. But it’s not so bad on Revan. 
I’d also add that it’s the norm for Revan and V. Like most SF are.
-----
skillzilla81: I know there are a lot of people getting a "lag issues" but man... I was just playing it yesterday and I absolutely WONDER WHY ALL THESE Issues HAVE ALL OVER THE RESETE AGAIN IN ACCORDING TO EVOLUTION. 
I'm so glad I decided to quit playing and step away from the game after I was done with it because it was really bad.
-----
Scotia: Yeah I honestly don't get it. They're just so easy to cheese I don't think I've ever felt any frustrated playing a game that tried to be hard I just knew jumped the shark and sent me flying. 
I mean I would've much rather had been able to use the shoulder buttons for moves and still probably hold the shoulder buttons perfectly. It's frustrating but so easy to forgive by just having a terrible rage problem.

====================
~!~Which is worst - Breath of the Wild or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild?

Phantom Thief: ​Breath of the Wild
This is a question I often have the moment in my life. Breath of the Wild is my first Zelda game and, for the life of me I can't decide which game is the worst. The first Zelda game that I ever got for the PS3 was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The game was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. 
I have never been as invested and spoiled as I have been for the last 15 years, and The Legend of Zelda was the first game that I ever started learning about the world around me. I had always been so interested in the story and the world was mysterious. I never got the chance to play the first dungeon, but I remember the hype when I finally saw the intro to the world in full. I never really got into RPGs, but I was interested in the idea and the gameplay, and I was also interested in the charm of the game. The intro movie for the game, though, was too good.
I am in the mood for a Zelda game after a long time away from gaming. Breath of the Wild is a great game, but I have a feeling it is going to be difficult to go back to. I know that, at the same time, I am getting tired of the same kind of games. So, I'm going to go with the most recent example.
Breath of the Wild is the first Zelda game that I ever got for the PS3. I had been waiting for the PS3 to go on a disc, and the hype really started to blow me away. I played the first mission of the temple and was really excited to explore the wild west. However, as soon as I started the game, I immediately knew that I am not interested in the open world aspect of the game. The game is a sandbox, not really designed for getting anywhere quick. I am not really planning on traveling back to the first BOTW - I only have a 3x3day notebook to use on 3ds.
I am going to play the game this weekend. I am going to have to go up to the Lakemaster Inn.
The intro movie tells me that I am not interested in the open world aspect of the game. But, I am interested in the the side quests.
I have

~!~Are there any other examples of a creator giving money to charity?

KrigareN-: I just noticed that, in the latest thread on the Red Dead subreddit, a guy gave $10,000,000 in microtransactions to a charity, and actually gave the game to his friends.
I don't think this is a real charity, but I found this reddit post on reddit.com/r/AskGames or reddit.com/r/Silent_Gamer/comments/ None of these communities is known for giving money to charity, so I wonder where are they?
-----
Lite_Agent: It's got to be RDR2, right?
-----
Kyoufu: Just RDR, that's all I ask.
-----
KrigareN-: I guess I'm not wrong.
-----
Kazoku_: I saw this earlier and was perplexed.
-----
Kazoku_: If I understand correctly, the guy must be asked about RDR2.
-----
Kazoku_: The guy doesn't ask. I was just wondering if this is a real charity or if this is something that's been done before.
-----
Kaz Mk II: It's a charity worldwide.
-----
Kazoku_: Huh, I didn't realize that.
Is this a charity in the gaming industry or is this something entirely artificial?

~!~What are the chances of a Punch-Out!! spiritual successor?

TheGamingNewsGuy: There seems to be a lot of talk about a new Punch-Out!! coming to the Switch, which I feel is a lot as it would be waiting for a new console and not being as financially viable as it used to be. I am wondering if there are any other IPs that would be more likely to see the series gaurd in maintenance on life wise and get a new IP in a new IP ala the GoldenEye 007 games. 
An example would be the Mighty No. 9 arcade port. It had a few issues but it was a return to form for the series. 
My other favourite Mega Man series would sorely miss a game like this. I love Punch Out!! and I am happy to see it survive. What are your thoughts on the matter?
-----
Bandage: - One Punch Man
- Street Fighter II
-----
HardRojo: I'm in no particular agreement, but I'd love a new Punch-Out!! in the style of a mid-budget Yakuza game, or something.
-----
L Thammy: I wish they'd give us a current-gen 2D Rival Schools collection like Street Fighter IV. That'd be incredible.
-----
TreIII: One Punch Man for Switch, Street Fighter II.
-----

-Le Monde-: I would love a new Pangya, but it would be too expensive even for a new IP.
-----
Zippo: I'd rather they give us a new Punch Out!! with a new IP or at least a new Onimusha, but both would be great.
-----
gabrielredu: I want a new Punch Out!! with a new IP
-----
Unknownlight: The one time I truly cared for it, I'd love a new Street Fighter.

====================
~!~Does anyone else feel this way?

Jawmuncher: Been playing a lot of Smash lately and this came to mind. The battle system and its ability to transition Assist Trophies into the game is really cool. 
I’ve had this thought ever since I saw the first trailer for Smash Ultimate that one of the things Smash as a fighting game should strive for was a “everyone is here” mode. I know that’s what the trailers and trailers for Smash Ultimate are but for me at least this sounded like it was a good idea. I think the trailer for Ultimate really highlighted this concept. 
With this concept being so fresh in my head and me wanting to play Smash again for a while now, I think it would be cool for Smash to try to provide something different. Something more akin to the Injustice 1/2 Raid Pass and the Raid Battles in MvC, but in a fighting game with a progression system instead. 
I’ve been really interested in seeing if there are folks out there that played any of the other modes. 
Are there any other people that are like this?
-----
Renna Hazel: I like the concept but I feel like I've had enough of 'everyone is here'. I'm definitely gonna try out the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Assist Trophies if I get the chance.
-----
KZXcellent: This is one of the reasons I'm super excited for Smash Ultimate.
I feel like there's a big shift. From the first trailer, the mission structure and the structure of the stages were all like this.
-----
angelgrievous: I'm into it.
-----
TheMink: I mean you can say the exact thing you want but I don’t give a shit. I’m just here for the experience.
-----
Cantona222: I'm into it.
-----
KZXcellent: It's the same for me. I just wish there were more DLC content packs. I would like to see some more character-specific rewards for purchase.
-----
Benzychenz: It's my favourite Smash but I think it would be pretty boring if the missions were a bit more impactful, especially if they're being placed in the World of Light.
-----
Cantona222: Yep.

Benzychenz: But that's exactly what they

~!~What are your top 5 FF7 games?

SantaC: FFVII is at the top of the best sellers list. It is also on sale for the first time it has been in one of its print and play stores since 2002. FF7 is also on the list since June 22, 2002.
My top 5:
3. Final Fantasy 7 - No contest. This is the last RPG Square released before the XIII jump. The next FF that came out after that was FFX.
2. Final Fantasy 8 - Perfect blend of action and exploration. Great game with a great story. Great cast.
1. Final Fantasy 8 - A disappointment. A disappointment in every other entry. Square released a remake of the first game which was amazing and one of the best RPG experiences available in the PSX era. Yet, they never released a numbered entry in the series again. They even released a new FF on Mobile, but this was their mobile game.
I was surprised to see that FF7 is a top 50 FF, or even top 10.
Honorable mention goes to Final Fantasy Versus. So many memories.
-----
kennyamr: FF9.
(Square brought me back my youth, thanks to the rest of my years as a hobby).
It's also my 1st favorite Final Fantasy.
I played and loved the original 2 Disc, which was my first time playing the game.
(I loved the original 2 Disc too, but I think I prefer 9).

Delaney: I really love the top list! I'm also the only FF I played through all the way to the end with the exception of VI. I also played both FFVII, FFVIII and FFIX back to back, as well as the PS1 and PS2 versions, so there's quite a lot to say about them!
I also love the fact that the game is set up in a universe where you can move your party around as you want. You can even do fancy events in towns that take place on a clock, which I'm pretty sure is in the PS2 version.
-----
Aurc: Agreed. I've played FF7 all the way to the end with the original 2 Disc. It's also my second favorite FF game.

~!~PC Gaming needs to die

JCHandsom: I’ve been playing my PC more than ever before and for more than a decade. There is no way I’m making a massive one-word post and just going by that.
If I was going to use “dead' to spell out my thoughts, I’d use the word “no”.
No, there is no way I would ever give a shit about no microtransactions. There is zero chance they ever try and use them in anything other than cosmetics. It’s a hard decision to make for sure, and they will keep doing the same thing (and usually with new MTs added in).
I’m not even talking about loot boxes or in-game currency, but anything that makes loot boxes easier. Things like better support for groups with more than 3 friends, more options for customization (namely skins, loot boxes, in-game currency, etc.), and a better communication about what’s going on with the community are more important things to me. Right now there are no OTs for the game (yes, even on OTs...). There are no OTs for the store for the MTs (again, OTs like this one). There are no OTs for the servers for the game (again, OTs like this one). They’ve literally made it impossible for me to completely enjoy the game. I’m completely baffled by this.
I’m mainly a PC gamer that also plays on consoles. I mainly focus on PS4 and Switch. I actually never even played the original Divinity 2 on PC.
It’s honestly a real bummer of man that we are still not being remastered with a photorealistic art style that completely destroys the atmosphere of these games. Even with the patches, it’s still not as if these old PC games are ever given a proper PC port. I’d love to be able to play the original again on my Switch, but I have to agree that this is a really sad day for gamers.
Do you guys have any suggestions for better PC ports? I don’t think we should have to make every PC games available in one place so we can all enjoy the game on PC.

~!~Microsoft announces Initiative Playathon - Halo & Forza Horizon 4-inspired free-roam & online game

SuikerBrood: 
-----
Klobrille: I don't understand this.
-----
christocolus: lol
-----
1-D_FE: This is pretty cool. I wonder what kind of game would be made from this? Something that will be like Monster Hunter but with a focus on fun and challenge?
-----
SuikerBrood: Sort of. 
Halo is an MMO, but FH is more like a shared open world game.
-----
Hooks: Thats neat. I wonder if this is more like Minecraft or just an online game using your Xbox for unique events
-----
Hooks: It's more like a mix of Forza and Monster Hunter. The Forza games are similar to Minecraft but with a much wider variety of activities to do.
-----
SuikerBrood: I don't know because I was playing the demo.
-----
christocolus: So much more details. And it looks like a mix of Forza and Monster Hunter. The game will have events where you can win stuff. There will be custom "events" such as new gear, weapons, new classes.
-----
Hooks: Yea I think I heard Monster Hunter is similar. I am playing that right now, am curious to compare it to that

~!~What's the best recording device for PS4 and PS3?

dawgparty: I've been thinking about buying a new recording device to supplement my current setup. I know that the latest models of recording apps aren't available on the device itself but I'd still like to know what the overall consensus is on this device. I own a few OG and X models so I'm looking for something to record and share with others.
-----
alr1ght: PS4 recording is the best. But, that device isn't the best. It has kickstand support, but it's not a powerhouse either.
-----
Chivalry: You can pick one of these up and use it with my PS4, its definitely worth it.
-----
dawgparty: I'm interested, but I'm always left wanting more. I've been on a 240p streak so far and I have a Switch so I'm looking at stuff to do before diving into PS4.
-----
chandoog: I have a Philips booth and the PS4 app works great and also I have a couple of devices hooked up to HDMI & I use them fairly evenly.

Chivalry: You can pick one up and use it with PS4.

~!~Ouija Pinafore announced for Switch/PS4

sinonobu: OSAMA Pinafore is a pixel art visual novel/dating sim/RTS released for Nintendo Switch and PS4 and it’s coming out on Tuesday, July 31.
The game is still in development and is being written by Chris Avellone and is written by the wonderful Janès Jacobson. It’s available on all Nintendo platforms. It will be published in English and Russian on PlayStation and Xbox in Europe as well.
The Vita version will also be released on all platforms on the same day.
-----
Lite_Agent: That's a very low bar, tbh. It's a really interesting visual novel.
-----

Kresnik: Not actually a Visual Novel, just a VN with dating sim elements. I guess it gets a little bland after awhile.
-----
sinonobu: currently planning a playthrough, looking forward to reading impressions
-----
Vareon: I haven't played it in a while, I really need to.

Kain-Nosgoth: you're in for a treat

~!~How is the Switch port of Final Fantasy XV?

Pog: I never played Final Fantasy XV, but it’s a game I always wanted to try. I have some issues with the game itself, but want to pick it up as soon as I can.
I know it’s a mobile game, but it seems to hold up really well. I don’t know if I should be complaining about performance or the controls. 
Any recommendations?
-----
Maxina: I don’t know about performance but the game holds up really well.
-----
KZXcellent: I have had the game on my phone for quite a while. The controls are still fine and still require a bit of work but it's a fairly simple port. The game itself is a pretty smooth 60fps experience.
-----
Pog: I played the game for a little while, but it feels like it ran like shit. I know they’ve fixed the controls of the mobile version and that’s how I know it’s a great port.
I’m planning to get it on Switch but I’m not sure if I have enough play time before I can recommend it.
-----
Gnorman: I played the game on my phone and loved it, it's a great port!
-----
Alastor3: this is coming from someone who played years ago and played the mobile version for hours and could not recall why. 
It was not made for mobile. It's a game for everyone. 
I think the controls are fine, you can fool around with magic at times, but the game is not for mobile.
-----
sir_crocodile: its a good port.
the camera is a bit clunky in handheld mode, but theres a pretty easy way to adjust it to handheld mode.
-----
Maxina: I have to say that the controls are a bit clunkier than I remember when I played the game, but I can see why people loved it!
-----
KingdomHeartsFan: I played the game for a while when it first came out but could not hold a second time. I never used the party members though.

~!~Does anyone remember the original Pokemon Bank?

Forkball: This is the most wholesome Pokemon ever. I remember spending the first six years of my 2nd year at the convention center as a child. I would see all the beauty of the region, and I mean all of it. But then I had to go into my comfort zone and realize that a lot of the games with the original systems (like the ones you could play with) were awful. Not even the original starters and trainers, or even the ones you could pick up and use as a block between attacks. The ones with the original evolution and trainer battles. I remember the single battle with the big ugly creatures. The one fight with the crap EV-locked trainers. The one fight with the Pokemon that wasn't the "evolution" on purpose, and I can only imagine how many times that was.
I don't have nostalgia for the original, but I remember renting it for rent years ago and seeing all the little things. I remember renting it at the convention center for two months or so. It was my first and my favorite pokemon console.
-----
Raijinto: For what it's worth I actually bought one of these for my niece this year (found a really good deal for like $200).

~!~Darksiders III DLC: The Bellows are Back[/QUOTE]

Hate: I really can’t get enough of this game. The marketing is so good. The art is top notch, the story is great, and I’m so bored of the combat so far. I’m currently sitting on the bench in front of the Twins because my hands are sore from a long session without rest so I have to try and keep playing again. One of my favorite things about this game was just taking enemies down as they come back from the Dark World. I just dozes. 
I’m hoping the combat is fun and not frustrating. It looks like it’s easy at first with the dodge and parry mechanics. I feel like I can keep going back to enemies and have fun getting to the cool stuff. 
Anyone else play this? What are your thoughts on it and what would you like to see in the sequel?
-----
Hate: I hope it isn’t frustrating as all the gameplay mechanics are very similar.
-----
The perfect Dark: I'm addicted. Just waiting to finish it.
-----
Cess007: The combat is fun, I'm not sure how it feels now, but that´s what I love about the game
-----
Hate: Yeah, it’s not a very good combat system compared to other games. Almost feels like a mix of Dark Souls and Dragons Dogma.
-----
Starlatine: i really hope darksiders 3 doesn't have the same tank controls and camera system from 1. maybe push sq instead. Also having the souls and blood stuffs added to the mode makes it far more fun.

Cess007: Yeah, I honestly didn't know that. I just remember feeling that way when playing the demo and not knowing what to do or where to go.

No need to play it unless you need to, imo.

Cess007: I feel like you are missing out on a lot of fun. I mean, the game is not even a challenge. I'm not really hardcore, but it's fun for a while. I like playing games with my brain too, and I think it's just that the games are more fun when I play with my whole brain than anything else.
-----
Thewonandonly: I’m just not sure what I am missing I think I’m just playing with my brain I don’t need to play games to relax or feel like I’m doing something else or getting distracted from something I’m really bad at

~!~How have Nintendo successfully embraced gyro control?

Neiteio: First, I want to preface this by saying that I have never used a stylus before, and I know very little about the technology that Nintendo (and Nintendo developing companies) is working towards with that aim.
I've always wanted to check out a gamepad to get a good idea of gyro controls, and the Switch is the first console I've really been really into. It looks very promising, and I'm wondering if Nintendo themselves have adopted it or if it's the "best" to "more complicated" design of every other Nintendo handheld.
So far, the only thing I've found that Nintendo has done is add some button mashing for touch screen functionality, and I agree with that principle applied to almost every other Nintendo console.
I've always thought that gyro aiming is the most perfect handheld design, and I know almost nothing about game mechanics or technology at all. But it seems that Nintendo is really starting to compete with the power structure of the Switch, and that's pretty exciting to think about.
So far, I've only found one game that seemed to fit what I wanted out of a Wii U gamepad, and it was Super Mario Odyssey, and how well that game worked out was pretty unique. It's also worth noting that I only read about this back in April, but I was really surprised at how far it has come since then.
I know that Nintendo may not have adopted the gyro aiming of the Switch, but the fact that it's the only thing that is making Nintendo's games better is pretty unique.
So, Era, have you ever thought that Nintendo's innovation in gaming has made them unique or unique in that sense, or that Nintendo's innovation in gaming has more to do with the level of game design, or that Nintendo's innovation in gaming is more limited, or that you feel that Nintendo's innovation in gaming has made them uniquely innovative in the gaming industry?
-----
vestan: I think they've definitely been innovating in the gaming space in a big way since the Switch came out. I'd argue even Microsoft, Sony, and some of the other "big three" have all been at the forefront of this.
-----
Ehoavash: I think we can agree that they've been playing ball and have been able to make the games look more on the same screen

~!~What are the best GameStops around the US?

TheFallenSaboteur: I'll go first with my experience: I live in the northern part of the state where I live in St. Louis. My parents bought me a PS4. I only recently got back into gaming, having been stuck at work the entire day. I usually play games on the PC. 
But one time, I went to a GameStop, grabbed a $30 disc and started a $20 disc. I got $30 back but I only got $40 for the privilege of having a $20 copy of Street Fighter V, and that's kind of why I live in St Louis and love it. I have a pretty good selection as well. 
But one time I wanted to buy a new controller. I went to a local GameStop and picked up a controller. I bought the $30 back as a gesture towards not getting another controller (I had a Gamecube controller before), but I'd never used one in forever and have been waiting for a while. I've been wanting to get a new controller for the PS4. But I'm not great at playing Smash, and having played a little over a year I don't really have any moves for my hands. So I went to a local chain and got the same controller. I didn't know what the deal with that one was, and the first time I tried to use it, I was instantly taken out of the game. I wanted to get back into it but I didn't know what.
So I went to my local Wal-Mart and noticed a controller on there. I thought it was fake, I was in. I thought that MS might be gullible to get me a controller, so I bought it. But then it hit me that I wasn't playing the real thing. The thing was slow, but responsive and responsive. I know that I'm not really a skilled player, but it made me instantly go "Oh, cool" but also "Fuck, I really don't like this." 
Then the next store undercut the price and get the same controller. They had the same controller for $40 and I was in "wait a minute, this is actually real." and so I went through the motions. The first time I switched to a controller I was like "wow!" and so I went back to the store and picked it up. 
I got the controller and

~!~Cancelled Bioshock games.

Dragonzdogma: I mean, the games were never good.
I had written about my frustrations with the first hour or so but I realized it's way easier to play with a walkthrough than a lengthrun of the game.
I have a hunch we'd get Bioshock Infinite 2 and 3, but due to EA's support, I'm just not sure I want that game.
I have an Estimated of 5 hours of walkthrough play over all. I've been like this since Bioshock Infinite.
Anyhow. I have a very hard time remembering every event that happens or does something happen in the game, I'm avoiding things I don't want or things that I am not want.
I just want to play it again.
I feel like a lot of people either won't or have forgotten.
-----
DontHateTheBacon: No.
Bioshock is a perfect example of how EA can ruin a game for you if you're a fan and try to push their artistic vision.
-----
Imran: The Bioshock Infinite is an example of EA trying to make a good game. They really tried.
-----
dtraposo: I've only ever played the first hour or so, but I remember being completely blown away. The tension, the scope of the story, the cool animations, etc. ALL OVER the GRINDING of the final boss fight.
I had to turn it off after that, and I'm really considering giving the Bioshock a shot again
-----
Tibarn: This is one of my favourite games. Played through it with a friend last year and he really enjoyed it.
-----
Evilmaus: I had this issue with Bioshock 1, but knew it was the sequel... It was such a masterpiece. So much replay value and such satisfying level design.
I didn't have the patience to play it fully though, I'm replaying it right now and it's the second game in the series. So I'm going to just play it with a walkthrough first, now to finish the game.
One of Bioshock's greatest strengths is the atmosphere, it is such a truly fantastic experience.
I think the second game is the best thing to happen to the franchise, and the best game in the series to date.
I would love to play

~!~Let's talk about the new God of War, its flaws and merits

Toriko: So God of War is out just over three weeks and its just the butt-chow of God of War 2
The rebooted trilogy has been criticised for lack of Norse mythology and the latest GOW gives us a fresh take on the series with a new focus on Norse mythology.
The rebooted games have a much different picture to the old ones with each being focused on a mythological epic.
The GOW new trilogy is focusing on a Norse mythological epic with Thor and Odin involved.
The new God of War will have a Norse main character and Norse mythology sections where they will give us a collection of Norse books.
Kratos will be able to choose a part of the new trilogy that is suited for him and will be able to have a grand journey that will pay tribute to the gods and history that made them so great.
Speaking on the recent God of War news, we will learn that the new GOW game is still in development.
The new GOW game will feature multiple boss fights of old from the original series.
Each boss fight will include a new mechanic from the old series.
The new God of War game is planned to have a longer playtime than the old games.
I really hope that the new God of War game is also shorter and just 40-50 minutes rather than the 50-60 minutes seen in the old games.
So far we know that the new God of War game will have 60-70 minutes playtime.
However, we do still have one big hope that the new God of War game will be 60-70 minutes long.
The new God of War game will be set in Egypt and will feature a mythological epic that has not been done before in the series.
The new God of War game will also be a celebration of Norse mythology.
The new God of War game will have a new set of bosses from the series and will have a new set of puzzles from the series.
The new God of War game will have a darker tone but no traditional open world like the previous ones.
The new God of War game will not have the open world of the old games.
The new God of War game will be a new IP from GOW2.
I really believe that if they manage to land this God of War game in a reasonable amount of time, they

~!~LTTP: Lisa the Pain [PS4]

palomo: After nearly a decade...we're FINALLY moving on. Lisa the Pain has been one of my favorite game franchise. I love the quirky and humorous story telling, the goofy characters, the quirky tone, and I love the gameplay.
However, Lisa the Pain has one major flaw.
The game is a puzzle game.
The game gives you two choices when you to activate the final boss room. One is Lisa the Pain, and the other is the option to "Go back to where you came from". You can either save a princess Lisa who is about to fall in love with, or go back to the castle and help Lisa get in a hover pod. Both of these will grant you Lisa the ability to go back to the last stage (the one where you meet Lisa the Pain).
The game is not very long. I finished it in less than an hour, but I think I've finished it many times. It just never gets boring.
The last game that made me happy was Spider-Man. I loved the game, and my god, I love this game. I don't think it's even a contest of the best game, but it's just a joy to play.
Any tips for a newcomer? I'm already well underway on my first playthrough of Spider-Man, and I'm just enjoying the story and characters.

No Depth: I’m about 10 chapters in and it’s only gotten worse as the chapters went on.

Its a roguelike game with a narrative and a great art style. I would get so hyped if it had roguelite content, it's just a bummer when i get it. Bought it on PS4 not too long ago.

~!~LTTP: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's true Dungeons- A new game from one of the greatest series ever made

Horse Armour: What a ride.
A little while back I made a LTTP for the NES original, one of my first ever. I've been meaning to play more of this series for a while but I never had the foresight to start playing one at time. I have a PS2, but I can't remember where I got it. I know it was published by Tecmo, so that would probably be good advice for me.
Anyway, I'll be honest, I was expecting to go in blind on this game. I'll see if I can find a few interesting tidbits and I'll probably pass.
I started off with the Hyrule Dungeon. It's a pretty short dungeon and it's pretty short. I don't remember what the purpose of the dungeon was, but it seems to be a last ditch effort to get Link to Pew on your way. I already know he's there, I've heard some of the best dungeon music. I started the dungeon and it's pretty short. Not sure if there's much of an advantage to playing on hard. The big dungeon gimmick of the game is the Divine Beasts. This gimmick starts off as a puzzle puzzle, but it's REALLY REALLY easy once you get the right team. There's a lot of really cool enemies in this dungeon. The main gimmick is that you can create statues to fight your foes. You can create statues to fight your foes and then use them to fight the Divine Beast. You can use them to climb all over the dungeon and there are even grapple points, which allow you to climb all over the dungeon itself. You can create a statue for free by attacking it and then pressing A + Jumping (it charges you fast, but you can create multiple statues at a time). You can also charge whenever you want, which makes it really fun to press jump.
The Divine Beasts are really cool, though if you're not feeling the dungeon really dive into some Oracle style dungeon. The first dungeon is really confusing, though I understand it's own structure and it's a puzzle game. The Divine Beast is a really cool boss fight and is a reason to love the dungeon, as it's the perfect place to start learning about the Divine Beasts. The first Divine Beast fight is pretty much where the game went from "fun" to

~!~What is your favorite instance of a game being a modern masterclass?

theofficefan99: I think it's the first time I'm actually feeling it. 
I love abstract games like The Last of Us, Nier Automata, etc., but my favorite is probably The Wonderful 101. It's just so damn cheap, fun, and just plain great. 
It's also the first game I played with two controllers, so I'm pretty close to a Switch setup, but we're not even sure if I'm ready to play it yet. 
I'm not even sure if I will ever finish it. I love it to death, and like it so much. 
It's also the first game that made me initially uninterested in multiplayer games. I just love that there is actually a disconnect between the player and the action, so I love playing it competitively. 
...oh, and I love that they put in multiplayer! It's just so damn fun. 
I have a lot of issues with the game story telling, but I love hearing about the characters and the relationship between lead/protagonist. I've never played a game set in a city, but I love hearing about all the different ways they interacted and what their motivations were. 
All these things are so intriguing and made you feel like a real person, and it's a game that doesn't shy away from making you feel any way you want. It's the kind of game that will seriously outplay anything else, and make even the most casual gamer gobsarger.
I love the way they portray friendship, strangers and the concept of people's lives in a video game. I love this aspect of the game. 
I can't get enough.

BioDigital Jazzman: It’s underrated. I was going to post this in the other thread but didn’t see a thread, thought I’d bring it here. One of my favorite games of all time.

Brass Body Dave: That's a really good take, love it.

TheRedSnifit: I can't even begin to describe how elated I was at finding out this game was coming out. 
I'm really in for the VN that doesn't have microtransactions.

====================
~!~The digital only future is now as good as ever

Araujo: So I just finished reading a review of a game called The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for Kotaku. 
The game is contemplating the huge problem with open world video games, the problem is that the hobby is not going to be ready for a Zelda game without the heavy marketing behind it.
Breath of the Wild's open world exploration is one of the best things in the industry and one of the most unique games ever developed, with its amazing atmosphere, sense of wonder, wonder.
But reading the review for the game for the first time made me think about this.
As a huge fan of open world games, I really don't want to wait for a Breath of the Wild-level remake, as I always felt the need of Zelda exploring in Breath of the Wild. I know there are many open world fans who don't even own a Switch, and even I consider myself a casual fan, but I would really like to play Breath of the Wild day one.
However, I have to admit, I was not expecting this to be anything like the open world exploration and more linear, linear games. Not only does this feel like a cheap cash grab, it also feels like I'm not really getting much more than a small ~open-world~ into the game. The most important part of Breath of the Wild is the exploration, and even though I enjoyed the main story and some side quests, I feel like I'm not really getting much into the deeper, more interesting side quests.
And this is coming from someone who has never played a Zelda game before, and who is definitely not the first one to admit the same.
And yet, the game is categorically not open world. It's not open world because it's a linear game. It's not open world because players are just wandering around in a world they don't want them to go into. It's not open world because the game is linear.
It's not open world because open world games are more linear, and yet it's a choice game to explore.
The game is not even trying to be a money grab, as it is in fact. It's not trying to be open world because open world games are more personal. It's not open world because the game is designed for linear games. It's not open world because the game is designed for linear games.

~!~PC Gaming- A Highlight of 2018

Tizoc: Welcome to another edition of PC Gaming Highlights thread, where I cover the top PC games of 2018 across four editions.
1. Red Dead Redemption 2
If you have no interest in Horizon: Zero Dawn, you might want to check this out. It's a really fun, small-ish RPG that takes about six months to finish, and is generally well-liked by its player base.
2. FIFA 19
If you have no interest in fifa, you might want to check this out. It's a fun, fast-paced soccer game, with an engaging skill system, and superb tactical and tactical backdrops.
3. Anthem
If you have no interest in destiny, EA, or microsoft, you might want to check this out. It's a fun, concise, and enjoyable little JRPG with light RPG elements, and fun to play, but also a bloated stat-driven, loot-spike-filled open world. It's $15 on Steam, however.
4. Monster Hunter World
If you have no interest in monster Hunter, you might want to check this out, as it's a great, concise, and fun little RPG with a cool graphics style. It's $15 on Steam, however.
5. Call of Duty: Black Ops 4
If you have no interest in singleplayer, you might want to check this out, but, if you are a singleplayer, you may want to consider diving into multiplayer. The singleplayer game is a lot of fun, but also has an interesting skill tree with lots of options and options to play with, and it's a game where you have to figure out the various types of jobs and all the gear you get to experiment with.
6. Shadow of the Tomb Raider
If you have no interest in The Witcher, you might want to check this out. The story is short, but the world is fantastic and exploration is superb. It might be a little overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be doing it for a whole lifetime.
7. Forza Horizon 4
If you have no interest in first party, the Xbox One X is a great game to play, and there's a lot of great stuff on it. It's also a great game to play on a console, so get it.
8. Ashen

~!~The Story of Switch’s Joycon Ditching Us

Slam Tilt: Buy this thread if you don’t want to dump your joycons during the holidays. It’s your new accessory to use comfortably at the back of your Switch.
Nintendo has been ditching us for the better part of the year for controllers. While it may not be much of a deal (plus, you get a 3DS for example), when I first saw the news, I figured that they were ditching the whole $59.99 us Nintendo deal.
It’s 2018, everyone. It doesn’t even have a permanent dock, so the Switch just kind of bucks trend by ditching us Joy Con controllers. And its not even a quarter of the price.
I feel like every time I detach them, the spotlights just dimmy crash into the screen. It’s a real ball drop.
I hope this doesn’t go down in price. It’s $40.17 for Prime members at least.
Now, if you want to pig the hell out yourself, you can purchase a dock replacement shell for your Switch. That’s $133.19. And no, that’s not the regular $134.24 price (plus shipping).
-----
Toadsanime: And I'm waiting for that price tag... :(
-----
Cartridge Games: I mean, I know the joycon ditching/replacement shells is a few companies, but I’d rather they stick to making new joycons for the holidays
-----
Sheepinator: What do you mean? The Switch is selling at its lowest price since January, and they want to sell more now?
-----
Cartridge Games: Yeah, it’s been dropping in price slightly since then.
It’s been like $13 a month or so
-----
Rayearth: That's $13 a month for the first month or $13.19 a year for now.
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: I wish they'd drop the price. They're around $13 new in a month.
-----
Slam Tilt: It's $13 a month... and $13.19 a year for now.
Oh wait.

Sandfox: Yeah.

Cartridge Games: Yeah, it’s

~!~What game made you feel unrewarded?

Eolz: I've noticed that a lot of games have a problem with feeling like you're missing out on something, by feeling you should be supporting the developer/publisher/devs if you want to accomplish your dream/ideas, but it's not so much the game itself, but rather the way the game is marketed/teased you are expecting.
For me, it's God of War 2018, I'm interested in how the story is going to play out, I've read a lot of previews around it and I'm intrigued already, but I'm always looking for the next thing. I love the world and the setting, the story and I think there's a lot more to the story than that (beent say, God of War, all that), but I don't feel like the game is getting the recognition it deserves.
It's not an ideal situation for Atlus, who are rather predtennigent in terms of having the level of ambition to be the 'next Gen-A' game, but it's not a golden age of SMT I'd say.
So what game made you feel unrewarded?
-----
DecoReturns: I’m not even sure it’s God of War. 
Everything I read about is because of good games. 
It’s not a golden standard for me.
-----
Dark_Castle: I played a lot of Assassin's Creed back then, a lot of open world action games and RPGs, etc. So that kind of sums it up for me.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Metroid Prime
-----
Renna Hazel: I'm not sure if I'm in the right but I did like the first Mass Effect a lot.
-----
Yavga: I really like the story in Mirror's Edge, it’s a pretty generic sci-fi RPG.
-----
Zushin: I don't feel like I have anything uninspired or interesting, but Catalyst was an incredible game.
-----
Phendrift: The Last of Us and Twin Mirror
-----
CannonFodder52: I don't really agree with this.
I mean, even the best games in the medium are just inherently crap.

~!~The Quiet Man’s PC port seems rough, but seems worth more system RAM

Maxime: From Tim Sweeney’s annual PC board:
I went to play the game and I realized that this patch is only supporting 4K of 64 MB. I thought this was kind of interesting.
I’d love an OS that could run UE4 on PC. I don’t want to play Switch at all anymore.
-----
Maxime: [EDIT: didn't realise there was a 4K patch. Sorry, wasn't aware there was a 4K patch. It's just a heads up for people that need to experience it. And maybe, just maybe, that they will soon release a patch that fixes it.
-----
2Blackcats: I was sure there was. 
I really hope they put that in because UE4 is way easier to work with and then some UE5 devs working with UE4 get that as well.
-----
RagingAvatar: This is a really cool idea and I'm glad that they're taking advantage of it.
That's a 4k target too. I'm curious if the patch actually fixes the performance.
-----
Maxime: Tim Sweeney teased this in the main thread when it was discussed. It seems to be targeting 4K.

~!~When a game is not "fun"

Plumpbiscuit: Something I always find with games I play are things I enjoy but don't pay much attention to.
I have come to the realization that I can be pretty productive and pleasant to other people with my gaming time. I can browse through the many options and buy or rent games I want, read expos or talk about the latest games I have been playing. 
I was playing Civ V recently and it's fun to laugh at a game with my best friend. One of the games he is playing is the sandbox one where you can explore the buildings you can find. I didn't really enjoy it. It was more like a survival game and it was pretty easy to understand when he was playing and understand what was taking his friend's friend's friend to the end of the game.
A game I have been enjoying playing for a long time is Death Walls. I'm not very good at games but I have fun when I'm playing. It's a survival game and a lot of the mechanics are similar to other survival games. The combat is fast and fun, the enemies are often competent and there are a lot of back to back fights, you can even change the color of the walls to your enemies. It's not that I can't have fun, I love the atmosphere of the game and I don't mind dying a lot. But that's just it. I'm not really in a position to give any advice or advice about any game and this is one of the things that make me enjoy playing it.
I'm not the best player in the world but I'm enjoying my time and I think I want to enjoy more of what I have but it's a bit difficult. I don't think I can talk about it in any forums but here is a topic about the driving mechanics for Monster Hunter World.
Driving
The driving mechanic is one of my favorite things in gaming and I love the way the game handles it. It's the car that you can drive, it's your "pool party" mechanic.
There are many ways to go about moving about the world and it's quite addicting. You can use it to move about and gain a lot of items, the items you have to take control of and get are always fun ways to do it. You can get certain items by hitting a button on the car and it will let you take control and change the "

~!~I was so hyped for Shenmue 3 back in the day.

ChristopherDX: I had a crazy good time with Shenmue 3 back in the day,and I spent so much time with my young cousins playing and watching each other play it. But back the day I was so disappointed in the game. The controls didn’t seem as fluid as I’d like, the camera didn’t seem as detailed, and the music didn’t sound as triumphant in my young mind as when I played it. 
Fast forward to today and I can’t believe I waited nearly two years for this game and waited with baited hopes for the best and stranger things ever. 
Now I am so much more hyped for the sequel and am now more excited for the dream collabs. 
I say they need to tone down the brutality then. 
It looked so gruesome and gruesome. 
The graphics looked so lifelike. 
The setting was just blue sky. 
The story was just... 
The setting was a secret alien civilization. 
The setting... 
The setting... 
The setting... 
The setting... 
I am just so overwhelmed with ideas and everything. Where should the hell do I put this all in one place?
-----
Silky: Don't forget the best song
-----
Mullet2000: I think you'll love Shenmue 3.
-----
Zukkoyaki: I think the game will be more than worth it for its story alone.
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: I'd be all over a Shenmue 3.
-----
FiXalaS: We need more love for games that are related to each other and not just a continuation of another game

DarknessTear: Yeah it's going to be a lot. I don't know what I want. It's just too much.
-----
Roldan: Cant wait for the interview with the Giantbomb guy to drop.

~!~What is the best way to play all of these old games?

justiceiro: Tried to find some games worth playing on PS4, but i remember that people average games get really bad, and some games are still good, but which one is the best? 
I am not even asking, but good advice, would you recommend any old games that were not numbered 1st in the USA to just newcomers, or ones that we all know, we just play cross world, and the 2nd world are better?
-----
Tabataire: I can't help, but when I hear this generation's games I can't help but think of those games that came out a year apart (GTA, Forza, Assassin's Creed etc) and think I'll never remember or like them. They're way too dated at this point, and the games are so good, I don't care what genre they're from.
-----
Mahonay: I’d recommend Playmore
-----
Tambini: I think you're missing a lot of good games coming out this gen
-----
Gamer17: You can play GoW , DQXI loaded on ps4 pro and you are golden.
-----
Kyoufu: The best way to play all of these games is to play GTA and Forza Horizon. But GTA is a lot more of a western style game than GTA. You can still enjoy it for a while.
-----
Mojito: I'd say play GTA 4, Forza Horizon and Shadow of the Tomb Raider and see if they have similar or similar recommendations.
-----
LonestarZues: I think the best way to play all of them is to play GTA 4 and Forza Horizon.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I don't know if it's the best advice or not, but I've only ever played the older ones (4 and V) as a kid, and now I'm on the fence about playing V and I really want to finish it.
-----
Manfred: Play Witcher 3. The Witcher 1 is a better game than the older ones and they are very different to the newer games in the series.

~!~Sega Ages Sonic The Hedgehog Film Film Film Has Been Released in Japan (PS4/XB1/Steam)

Zippo: It's about a week out from now and I just saw the first trailer for the film in Japan. 
It's not a bad Sonic movie. The music is nice, the visuals are impressive. The film itself is pretty good, too.
-----
FiXalaS: I want this to be good.
but will the movie be censored???
-----
Zippo: I do not know. or what exactly is wrong with the programming. 
The movie has a nice animation.
-----
Zippo: Ah, ok. 
This movie has the usual problems of a lacking budget. The problem is that the film does not have the usual negatives with the right details, so they need to be resuppressed from scratch. 
The problem is that the film goes through the usual mistake of censoring the film before watching it. It starts by saying "there's no way this scene will make it", and the camera zooms in and says "screw it, we'll be filming this when we see it." The problem is that the scene is supposed to be in the original script, and that's what the director is, and that's what the cast are supposed to be. 
The problem is Sega has decided to censoring the scene before they see it. So they aren't even gonna screen it.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Sega's legal is still up in the air. They're just trying to protect their "fanboyism" and not risk a possible lawsuit.
-----
Zippo: I'd be interested to hear details of the circumstances.

~!~What's your favorite world in the Metroid series?

SolVanderlyn: I've been playing the series for about 10 years now, and I've finally come around to the series. I've never been one to follow any story or lore online, so I never got to play the Prime games.
I recently started playing Corruption. My first thought was that I assumed Metroid 2 was the last one, but I really liked Samus Returns and 3. So I didn't really know what else to try or say. I guess it's 2D platformers.
So here we go, let's get the obvious out of the way.
1) The world of Samus and the Metroid franchise.
2) The lore surrounding Samus and Metroid was always fascinating to me. I knew nothing about the series, though I'd heard about some of the lore and I was curious as to what it said about Metroid to people like myself. I was surprised when I found out that you had to beat the game before the Aris hyperspace transitioned to the Nonaka.
3) The twist was pretty cool. The game's story is told in a pseudo-sequel to Fusion, by way of Zero Mission.
4) I like the anime and the lore surrounding the Nonaka more than the actual game. Samus's mother is a professor from the local library department at the school.
5) The ending was pretty neat. It got me thinking about the game again.
6) The game's lore and world designs were pretty cool.
It's a shame that the developers flat out refuses to acknowledge the fates of their characters. It's not like that with Metroid.
The game is incredibly difficult to get back into. It's a shame because I'm having a blast with it.
-----
halcali: I'm not sure about all the world's other lore, but I'm always up for a puzzle or puzzle.
I like the fact that you haven't really lost your world itself, but you lost it for some reason.

~!~Game Informers: How does the Switch's More Powerful Dock Match Your Circular Movement

ScOULaris: I've been playing Switch games for a week or so and it's clear that the portability of the dock is one of the top priorities of each game. It's no secret that the Switch's less ergonomic than other current-gen docks but while the developer side of things has improved, it's still a major drawback for the Switch that I find pretty glaring.
I've been using a circular grip grip for a good while now but I'm finding that the grip itself wasn't too great to use for long sessions in the dock. This is a pretty common issue that I find myself with all current-gen handheld devices and is something that I think about when I try to tackle PC gaming.
I want to use my Switch as a kind of gaming monitor for PS4 and XBox One sessions and vice-versa. I use the Switch Pro as a monitor. I want to use it as a gaming mouse and keyboard box for PC sessions, too.
SCROLL CLOCK!
Now, I'm honestly not the only one that craves for a better gaming Dock. I just don't understand why people get so attached to a portable console dock. It's not like people are buying a prope as well as the Switch.
How does Dock v.Case work?
First of all, I'm not talking about the number of individual pins in all of this. I'm talking about the pinout of each of the pins.
I can attach individual pins to the pins in the dock. So you can do this.
But I wonder if that's something that can be done in a way that you wouldn't think possible.
I wonder if that would be the Dock Handheld that probably is the Switch, or if I could have a similar setup for a portable console dock.
I'm guessing either the Switch Pro or Dock Handheld are the devices that you have on your mind when you design a Dock.
I mean, if you're thinking of using a Switch Dock, you are probably thinking of what kind of Dock you could be using.
-----
Chairmanchuck: You have to know what you are doing with the dock, before you ask.

ScOULaris: Yeah, I know. I am a bit more reasonable with my setup.

~!~Let's talk about the future of MMOs

Phabh: MMOs have been for a long time. They are now in a good place now with no huge dev costs, no broken mechanisms, etc. They don't need to rely on a subscription system, which has allowed to create great games like FFXIV.
But MMOs are complex and many aspects are being left for the worse by the new administration (the new president, next year). The biggest thing is, currently, they are in a dark situation where the developer can't even release the end of the year end date anymore, even though they already released the latest patch and the source files are in the hands of the original developers.
There is a huge problem of supply and demand for MMOs. The fact that we are getting more and more games, (Ori and the Will of the Wisps, FFXIV, and Anthem) that are all available on PC, PS4, Xbone, and other consoles, with some even launching on phones, is a real problem. Now, I know many of you are against that, but I'm curious how many of you think it will ever get better.
So, Era, what are your thoughts/ concerns?
-----
CountAntonius: The times when MMOs have gone away for good are those that have stagnated most recently compared to previously. They aren't too great but they aren't too expensive. It makes more sense to me that you'd be looking for a game that offers quality than quality MMOs.
-----
Aztechnology: GGG is all I really care about.
-----
Kadin: Well, for me personally that's kind of everything. MMOs were great before but have sort of been OK lately. The last few expansions I've played have all felt like a rough start. I'm not a huge fan of the first two main games and I'm not super far into the expansions for them, but the third one was very promising. I had a lot of fun with it though. I'd love to see it happen.
-----
7threst: I'm not sure I understand your situation or what you're asking for. I understand that you have a PC, PS4 and a Switch. I'm not really interested in a MMO, but if you can play it on the go, I think you can really see yourself playing it.

ILikeFeet: that's a cool way to show the community that they're serious about making Labo fun

GulAtiCa: Your garage is in the Quinton's house.

Jbourne: This is fantastic! I wonder how much assembly required to put everything together. I hope it's not as prohibitive as buying cardboard cheap to put on display.

Comic Obsessed: This is neat, but I'm not a huge fan of the cardboard cardboard trick used in the previous games to make cardboard cheap.

Comic Obsessed: Yeah, I remember that one.

Comic Obsessed: That's a heck of a lot of assembly but it's interesting to see Nintendo planning something like this.

====================
~!~Do you prefer a constant stream of high quality remasters with or without patches?

ToddBonzalez: Something I've noticed is that I've been playing a lot of third person games on PC. For example, Fallout 4, which is my current favorite game of all time, is still fantastic on PC. While I believe Bethesda's move away from patching has slightly impacted the quality of many aspects of the game, I don't think it was due to their shift to a patching free for all.
On the other hand, I realize there are a lot of things that can be improved with a patch, especially if they're trying to make the game run better so the player won't run into issues. The problem here is that there's no way of player count showing or going back to pre-alpha level. I've noticed a few player actions in FO4 that can be negatively affected by player performance. Specifically, running around the map long enough to make NPCs run away from me and shooting at them. The game is designed around this and since you can't go around the map without getting shot, it's a real deterrent to try and play the game as it should.
In contrast, I've been playing a lot of open world games on PC, and I've noticed that the game's design issues can be greatly remedied by player feedback. I've seen a lot of players over the years who exclaim that players are constantly running away from them, and they end up hitting the wrong marked car/walk button. The bugs I've encountered include:
- Lurching backwards through invisible walls
- Lurching forward invisible walls
- Turning off audio
- Turning on/off auto-camera camera smoothing
- Turning on/off framerate
- Turning on/off texture pop-in
These things have been many times more significant than the aforementioned issues. I've noticed many players drop frames mid-way through a level and then immediately jump through the level, despite the game comfortably running at 100+ FPS at launch.
I've also seen people play the game with micro transactions, and it's not really a game that's designed for constant backtracking.
This is what I've come across a few times with certain PC multiplayer games, and I've noticed that players sometimes end up teleporting around and breaking the game as a result. I'm sure this is my own observation, but I can't think of any other examples

~!~Nintendo confirms 5 years of console development for their next handheld

Muzy: Just announced during Nintendo's annual financial results call.
-----
KoolAid: Oh right.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: How the hell is Nintendo releasing a 5 year console that's supposed to last for 5 years and have games running for 5 years?

cw_sasuke: I thought they said 5 years ? :

~!~Earth Defense Force 4.2: DRAGONBLADE! (PS4) - 5,799円

ggx2ac: The previous title came out on PS3 days before the PS4 version came out and it looks like this one is a day late!
-----
HeisenbergWW62: I hope it's a sign of an imminent console announcement
-----
Savantcore: Wow, that's an awfully long wait.

Bird: Holy crap I need this. I remember buying this ages ago and not bothering anyone. Glad I didn't wait.
-----
jett: Awesome! Day one.

D65: I hope they announce it's coming to physical later. I really want to pick it up but I don't have the time I tried the DF PS4 version.

====================
~!~Remember Me: I came face to face with the NES and SNES as a kid and it was rough, but the SNES had such good charm.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I used to play these games back in the day, and I remember going to the store and picking one of these toys and seeing a TV show called My Life as a kid, and it was like, holy shit this is something I'd never seen before and it tells you so much about a kid's life up to that point. Up until that point, I'd only ever seen it as a kid's life presents. 
What was that? The SNES was the first console I had my own a hand-screened kid over and I had the hardware to play it with my daughter. It was like the first time I really cared about a kid and I wanted to play the game. I walked in the door and there was a shit man in a diaper holding a baby in his hands playing this shit and it was just fucking awesome. 
I remember I was playing Super Mario World back then and it was like, man that's some good shit. The NES and SNES got me hooked. The NES had the best box art and the SNES had the best soundtrack and when I got home from school I remember I had the same toys and I just asked my mom to play with me. I was so hooked.
When I got back home, I got this gut chuckle. I was born in 48 hours and I woke up in the middle of the night and all I thought was I wanna get fucked up and I wanted to play some NES. I walked into the house and the kids were playing Super Mario World and I had no idea what I was doing and then when I came back I realized I was playing a NES. I was like, "what the hell?" and they had all the cards, all the games, all the models, all the models from the first game, and then I remember that video about the boxart. I tossed it on the shelf and watched it on a loop.
I'm not really sure why I brought this up, but I know I wanted to. What are some other games like these that you played back in the day that you played with a kid? I don't really remember anything after but I have memories that I can easily make out.

~!~What are some good horror games

Kazuma Kiryuru: I've never been a big horror fan but after playing through Silent Hill 2, I decided to make my own horror game and it has aged quite well. The gameplay is fantastic and the atmosphere is perfect. The puzzles are all pretty much the same, but there's something about the way the monsters talk that just makes you want to stab and slash something. Its kinda weird and creepy but also fun and immersive. 
I have some questions:
1) What type of puzzles are you playing and for which puzzle type?
2) What puzzles do you find in your house and what order do you make your houses/objects from?
3) Did you try the Haunting Ground mod?
4) If you played RE7 and you liked it did you find any of the puzzles in the mansion?
-----
Mediking: Silent Hill 2 is so good
Edit: Lol I know this is old but...
-----
Aurc: The First one is pretty good.
-----
SJRB: The First one. Tried it once and liked it a lot.
-----
BuddyDharma: The First one.
-----
Vivi: I love this one, the creepy atmosphere and sense of grandeur is unmatched.
-----
a Question: What order do you play the games?
-----
Titanos: The First one.

nachum00: The first one.

~!~2D Action Game Vines to celebrate Women in Gaming

J 0 E: A new vine by the Vines is coming out in a couple of days and it's pretty addicting.
The vine is made with love in mind, specially the meat part. It's about love and games.
The meat is about love and games.
The meat is about ethics, humanism and why gaming is great and not great.
The meat is about games and why there aren't as good today as they were 30 years ago.
The meat is about Vines and the fact there is a plethora of them on Steam so far.
The meat is about the gaming culture as we've seen it and how badly it's been treated.
The meat is about the negative and the positive.

Kain-Nosgoth: Thanks for the heads up! I'm looking forward to this

====================
~!~I've been playing the original Dragon Quest for over a decade and it's seriously impressive.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I've been replaying the original Dragon Quest a couple of times over the last year. I'm a big fan of the Dragon Warrior games and the first game is absolutely marvelous. It's the best Dragon Quest that Square has ever released. But the first game is such a disappointment and a slog to play. It's painfully linear and a chore to get through. The combat is serviceable but janky and dull and just overall something about it just doesn't appeal to me. I've heard the second game is an improvement but I'm still not replaying it.
I'm still playing it and it's actually my favorite Dragon Quest game. It's pretty damn amazing.
I'm not going to get into the various ports and remakes that Square makes and all that. I'm just going to assume those are just straight-up ports and remakes of the PC version.
But I'm really enjoying it and it's one of my favorite RPG series. I love the tone Square has once carried over to the HD era. I like that your characters are your friends. I like that you're a warrior who has to conquer the gods who control the world and that you fight gods in a fantastical manner using swords, quenkins and even dragon cavalry. I love that the game's main plot is the war background and how all you're up against is a war machine. That's pretty badass. I like that the war machine is your friends and that you have to protect the world from the gods and from a plethora of robots and NPCs. I love the war machine especially because of how well it works and just how much of an emotion the war ends up and how many emotions there is to focus for it. That's just not good.
I love that you're back to your boy Flynn and how you team up with him to take down the war machine and Flynn. What a turnaround from the first game. You're Flynn's best friend and he's just becoming a better friend by the end.
I love that the story is going in-unity but I think it's just overall underwhelming and a victim of Square Enix's mobile game policies. I mean, I love the war machine in the first game and I love the world and characters of the first one. But I'm

~!~Anyone else have this problem of their XBOX controllers not working properly?

asmith906: I bought my Xbox controller on Amazon and I noticed that it worked no matter what version. Anyone else have this problem?
-----
NoKisum: I'm pretty sure that a lot of the time it's the HDMI cable itself that turns it into the TV.
-----
asmith906: I have a TV. I use my receiver for everything.
-----
Bjones: I have a TV.
-----
Ravelle: I have a TV-enabled receiver, which is essential for me.
-----
Darktalon: It's the XB1X and it's not working the same way all the time. 
The XB1X receiver works perfectly with all my devices.
-----
AM_LIGHT: I had a similar problem with my wireless xbox930 wireless receiver and it didn't work at all. The little guy had to be connected to the internet for the whole day until the problem was resolved. But turning the whole thing off for example worked fine.
-----
Elitist1945: It's the Xbox One X. I have a XB1X and no HDMI port.
-----
asmith906: I am assuming that is the problem. I am also assuming it doesn't work under the hood because it just turns it into a gamepad. 
Since you have a TV set it doesn't matter which version works but I have it hooked up to a TV. TV has no HDMI port.
-----
Kudo: I had the issue with my XB1X and it was always my TV, it doesn't work well with my Switch/PS4/XBO but I'm trying everything out.
-----

====================
~!~I just bought a computer for a living - must-have features for me

neo_net: My immediate reaction to the "living room experience" is "what the fuck"? 
I have a lifestyle like this one - I have a lifestyle like this one, shit I can't live another day. 
Must I just buy a new computer? 
What are the must haves? 
Will I be able to afford it? 
Will there be annoying/unnecessary crap like me having to hook it up to my tv?
-----
neo_net: Honestly, it’s very, very low. It’s not a big deal but a very small pain when you’re not playing on the computer. I have yet to have a computer room with a person I trust to play.
I’ve got a small apartment and living room setup myself. I have a living room setup but also have a work computer hooked up to it.
-----
neo_net: I believe there's also a Windows machine room, which is also a work computer I built as a hobby for a friend a few years back.
-----

====================
~!~Why is the Switch library so small?

The Great Khali: In a post mortem of a few years I found out about the Switch library. I mean, it's a very small library and it only has 2 games on the Switch. Zelda, Mario, Tropical Freeze and Fire Emblem are the only games I've played on the system. I didn't really expect to see a library like this as it's something I never expected to have the hardware and space to have games on the system but I guess that is just wishful thinking.
Now, I know that the Switch has a lot of exclusives I have yet to play and I know that I am going to find out more about the library that I don't have. I guess I am just going to find out about these 2 games then I can continue and beat these 2 games.
What happened with the Switch at that point in the life of the system?
-----
Mazzle: Because all those indie games are lost in the woods behind the bus.
Also, the library is smaller compared to the total subscriber count of twitch, instant, prime, netflix and prime members
-----
Grapezard: It's because you're not spending money on AAA.
-----
Knight613: Because a lot of these aren't Indies.
-----
Carthago Delenda Est: It's because you're not playing the games you want to play. Indies are big on Switch and the fact that arbitrary restrictions like these don't allow developers to release games on the platform.
-----
Mediking: I'm glad I don't have to buy a single indie game on the consoles.
-----
Jucksalbe: It's because games are simply too expensive to find on other platforms. They're very rare to find a game for a game that sounds like a game you want on the Switch.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: Indies are big on Nintendo systems.
-----
nbnt: I think we're approaching a new generation of consoles. I have yet to see a console with a large indie community.
-----
The Great Khali: I mean, I have to imagine they have to have the Switch in order to stay relevant.

====================
~!~Shenmue HD Collection announced (PS4/Vita, 2019)

ULTROS!: Just announced at the end of their stream!
-----
kennyamr: I'm curious how it will run on the Vita.
-----

Cess007: "The first one is currently not possible" and so I thought.
Great news, I really liked the HD Collection on the Vita, and I'm hoping this is a sign they're starting to work on it.
-----
OmegaSmash: Can't wait to finally play it.
-----
OmegaSmash: What are the chances of a Switch version?
-----
OmegaSmash: I mean, I get the idea, but it's probably still something that's just on the Vita, or that we never got a port to Switch.
-----
DarkDetective: I'm curious how it will run on the Vita.
-----
Akiller: Launch trailer:
-----
Zedark: Awesome, loved the Vita version.
I'll finally get to play through it.

====================
~!~How long do you think Capcom will keep their DMC3 Remake Alive?

dimasok: They have already been ship to the West after long term storage since.
I think they will release a different version of DMC4/DmC2
-----
vestan: No
-----
Okabe: No
-----
Etrian Darkness: Not a chance.
-----
S1kkZ: I dont think Capcom really needs to upload their assets to 4kP anymore.
-----
Kewlmyc: I think they will just ship it and talk about it and not try to scrub the history of anything.
-----
Bartend3r: 0 years, no.
-----
Neoxon: I mean, they're probably busy with their other franchises, but still, I think the next best thing to do is to get rid of Dante, Megaman, RE, etc. Personally, I prefer that. I never played the new DMC games, but I do love DMC4, and I can't wait to see what they do next.
-----
Neoxon: If we're talking about 2 years, then yes, they should start doing it.

====================
~!~I have a few questions about Persona 5

TheGamingNewsGuy: I have a PS4 which is in its early-twice out cycle and I have yet to play Persona 5. I have a couple of questions :
1. How important is the story to me ? Mostly it is the first playthrough and I know from my experience playing P4 that it is a big deal.
2. How important is the combat to me ? I think I missed some big QoL mechanics that I did not know before so I think I'm thinking about picking it up asap.
3. How important is the story to me ? Mainly I feel like I know what is going on. I think it is important to understand that the games is a big deal and Persona is not a JRPG. It is a RPG series and this is a big deal. I liked FFXV and I plan on playing FFXV when I have some more time to play it. I feel like I missed some cool little QoL mechanics I did not know before so I'm thinking about picking it up asap.  4 hours into FFXV, and I have a pretty good idea of what is going on and am liking it so far.
Spoiler
-----
Quinton: Hit me with your questions and answer as in story. Or not. That's the way to tell me everything is important.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I assume it is important? Right?? I have Persona and it feels very, very important to me. And Persona 5 is very important to me too so I guess that is important?
-----
Sophia: The story and everything goes in the background when you decide to start. If you like it, go and explore everything!
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah I am going to have to pick it up right after the onslaught of Persona games drop
-----
RDreamer: I always liked the idea of the Persona story being told by the player through the game. It was nice to have a player handle the narrative without the need for explanation. The game doesn't always have to be a good story to me. The Persona games do a good job at doing this. 
I'm not a fan of the way they try and translate the Persona experience into the way I'm experiencing the game. I feel the stories are told poorly and usually have terrible pacing. With all of the Persona games
====================
~!~Is it time for Nintendo to make a console with more open platform choice?

Memento: Nintendo has been really open with the amount of Nintendo games they put on Switch. They have a huge selection of games in a pretty wide variety of genres, pretty much all of them are amazingly fun to play.
There is a ton of stuff on there, but for me it is just time. I feel like a Switch is perfect for indies and AA content creators. And it has plenty of ports of indie games.
So what do you think? What are your expectations for their console?
-----
GrizzNKev: open platforms and more open standards would help. It's a good thing Nintendo isn't doing away with that.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Open-World games.
-----
Aokiji: We’re not getting ports of indies!
-----
Cartridge Games: They could probably port them to Switch as they say.
They have a lot of indie games already built on the same engine
-----
Datajoy: Open platforms, open standards.
-----
Mbolibombo: Open-World games...
-----
Cartridge Games: I think they already have Mario and Zelda Engine.
They already have a ton of open world games already built on the same engine, even on the fly changing the way the game works.
They could probably port them to the Switch as they say
-----
Mbolibombo: yeah, they are already using that engine
-----
vestan: Open standards, open standards.

~!~The Great Sphinx - Release Trailer (PC)


SolidSnakeUS: I'm sold. This looks dope.
-----
Dancrane212: I'm not sold on the game beyond the music.
-----

FairyEmpire: I'm really getting hype for this. Not interested in the platforms, but the tech behind it is pretty insane.
-----
mutantmagnet: I don't think Epic will ever be able to match the looks of this.
-----
NKnight7: Looks great, I'll have to check this out.
-----
Solidsnakejej: If they can pull of a 1:1 look at 60fps, I might buy this.
-----
Strafer: Looks pretty impressive.
-----

====================
~!~Digimon Survive Sqa & Neowire are now available on the Nintendo Switch


Mazzle: I remember this one being hard as fuck
-----
Phantom Thief: Wow, that's really cool! I had no idea they were bringing over Charmeleon and Digimon, I'll have to give them a shot.
-----
toythatkills: Wow. I'm down.
-----
Cartridge Games: That’s neat.
Probably won’t get it myself, but I’ll have to try it out
-----
Lumination: Wow, that's really cool. I'm curious how Kugimiya will handle this.
I also like how they've changed some of the monsters, like the Crissaegrim.
-----
Sophia: I'll give them a shot, probably double my points.
-----

====================
~!~I think it's time to bring back the dead-end train sequence from GTA: San Andreas

Bruceleeroy: This is the most perfect time to reintroduce this scene in the past, it's one of my favorite scenes from a video game.
Now, you've probably been asking me a similar question, what about when you've done all the side activities, gone to the bar, and come back to life? Now, I'm not talking about going to the same bar, I'm talking about going to a different town, come back to your life. What I'm talking about is the train sequence from GTA San Andreas.
I think it's time to bring back this scene again. It's so good, it doesn't even have to be about doing the same activities again. The whole game is about going back to your past, which is a completely different experience. In GTA: San Andreas, you can go back to the city, all the activities related to that exist in the game. In this game, you can go to all the buildings in your precinct, over 100 different locations, across all the buildings, across the state, across the city, and across the country, and across the sky. It's so good.
It's also one of my favorite scenes in all of GTA. The train sequence, the flashback to the train, the story-telling, the executioner, just all of those things. It's so good, yet so satisfying. I can't wait to come back and see what Rockstar has up their sleeve.
What are your thoughts?
-----
Svart: It is indeed amazing.
-----

Canucked: You can have it goooood.
-----
GrayFoxPL: From a gameplay perspective it is pretty weak.
-----
Bhonar: I think it's time to bring back the train sequence. It's not even a scene in GTA but it's a scene in GTAV that's so good
-----

Truant: It's time for another thread on this. It's pretty good, and that scene is used as the "point" of the game.
-----
Bruceleeroy: Yeah, I agree. It's great and sets up the foundation for the rest of the game.
-----
Lashley: Great scene.
-----
TheBeardedOne: It's a great cutscene.
-----

====================
~!~Assassin's Creed Odyssey just got a new patch!

Kylo Rey: Damn, this is fucking HUGE.
-----
FuturaBold: I was expecting this update coming soon
-----
Kylo Rey: Happy we are getting it with Patch 1.2
-----
FuturaBold: This is pretty damn great to hear
-----
Kenzodielocke: Still waiting for the patch to download.
-----
FuturaBold: Its a patch for the first DLC that they skipped over the entire Season Pass. They just chose not to do this.
-----
AlexFlame116: Holy shit! This patch is huge for me and I'm not sure I'll be able to finish the game within the time it takes to complete it! I'm really looking forward to this patch.
-----
Kylo Rey: There's a season pass thing, they don't want you to buy the DLC?
-----
AlexFlame116: Yeah but it's only free for the first 3 days. You can't buy the DLC if you haven't started the game yet.

====================
~!~New feature of Metroidvania/Metroidvania games

Eolz: From the official website for the first time:
-----
Donizetty: People used to think it had to happen in some way, and I was hoping it was a cosmetic change, but it’s been in the game for sure.
-----
entremet: Should have been there at launch. I feel bad for everyone involved.
-----
Akinsa: I think it's only slightly less relevant than a cosmetic change. No one wants to just buy a new copy.
-----
The End: I'd like to hear the talk about that mechanism from what was said about it before. Is that something people can just click on a link in the description of the page and get a notification that a new Super Metroid is coming soon?
I'm not sure what else they could have added.
-----
Khanimus: I mean, I'm all for it!
-----
Phendrift: I’ve been hearing about this for weeks and months and months, so I’m on board. I really wish the devs would take the time to properly implement it, and not implement it to the detriment of everyone!
-----

====================
~!~Why is the gap so large between the hardcore and casual audiences for AAA games?

ToddBonzalez: When the first Assassin's Creed came out, I remember the big complaints about the controls. Then the first one came out and it felt like the game was missing something. Then Assassin's Creed came out and it felt like the game sold poorly. And then Assassin's Creed came out and it felt like the next big AAA game. 
Then Smash. Smash. 
What happened between the hardcore and casual audiences? Do you remember it now?
-----
Firestorm: Because the hardcore haven't learnt any of the inputs from the controls of Smash?
-----
nsilvias: casual hasn't been Nintendo for awhile.
-----
Gevurztraminer: It's because they don't have the budget for all that. Smash isn't a Nintendo title, and Smash is a fighting game, not sure if the hardcore audience supports Smash.
-----
Kyoufu: They're better tailored for the big stage.
-----
KZXcellent: Because they don't have the budget and can't invest the development time to develop a proper fighting game properly.
-----
Etrian Darkness: The casual audience has always been Nintendo first party.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: It's because Nintendo first party games have never been Nintendo games. They were first party before Wii U.
-----
Renna Hazel: It's because they don't have the budget and can't develop fighting games.
-----
CaviarMeths: I can see the edge. I don't see the edge.

~!~Super Mario Party is now 28.99 on the Nintendo eShop. Party Crashes - A glitch has been discovered.

delete12345: Just saw this News Article.
It's SUPER MARIO PARTY
A glitch has apparently occurred between the Nintendo Switch version and the Nintendo Online (NEOG) version of Super Mario Party. The glitch involves downloading a balloon that has been floating off in mid air. If Mario chooses to lower the power, he will get a blue balloon. However, if he chooses the Nintendo Online (NEOG) version of Super Mario Party, a glitch will occur and the Party Crashes will take place.
In the event that you lose power, you will be exhanged into prison. No worries, you have been released.

Kiraly: I am glad it exists.

Regiruler: That doesn't seem like a game that will require the gamepad to work at all, at least to me.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: Doesn’t care about online functionality.
-----
KZXcellent: That's what I'm getting at. You're right, I'm glad it exists.
-----
Chauzu: I'm excited for the game.
-----
Regiruler: There's local wireless. However, there's local wireless in all games. The Switch doesn't support online.

Gamer17: Ok guys guys we are here in Darksiders 3 and want to discuss the points made . The video explains many things about Darksiders 1 and 2 and how the story started and then the end .

DekuBleep: Well then...

Silky: I don't know what you're talking about.

Dojima: Don’t forget the dark world of Darksiders!

~!~Thinking about purchasing a PS4 Pro at this rate, but it's too expensive

RoboPlato: I've been thinking about purchasing a PS4 Pro at this rate. I already have a gaming PC but want to get some other consoles to play on a different set of games.
I've heard the PS4 supports 4K Blu-Ray discs. I know the PS4 does not support native 4K Blu-Rays.
I've read that there are games which support 4K discs. I've looked the most up on Youtube but could not find any official information.
I've read that there is a way to disable motion blur. I've looked up the feature and it appears to be there, but I'm not sure if it supports it.
I'm mainly interested in games that support it.
What am I missing here?
-----
Knight613: You can set the resolution of the game to whatever you want.
-----
Vinc: I think you can set the resolution to whatever you want.
-----
Glasgow: It does not support native 4k Blu Rays.
-----
Ichi: yes, you can set the resolution to whatever you want.
-----
RoboPlato: So in this case it sounds like you can disable the motion blur. Thanks!
-----
IronicSonic: You can set the resolution to whatever you want. But it is not native 4k Blu Rays.
-----
Glasged: Yes, you can set the resolution to whatever you want.
-----
PopsMaellard: So 4K disks for buying a PS4 are coming, correct?
-----
The Last Wizard: I’d consider that a day one purchase or the next Sony system, at which point they won’t have any choice but to downgrade from native 4K discs and PSNow would be a huge cost increase for me.

~!~The soundtrack of Endless Ocean is truly incredible

ScOULaris: For those of you who were looking for some good electronic tracks to listen to, I thought it would be fitting to share here a selection of some of the best electronic tracks from Endless Ocean. If you're looking for a good Electronic DDR-style album with a minimal to no vocals, check out our Essential Music Vol. 1.
-----

Dyle: One of my favorite OSTs from Endless Ocean, especially for its synth-heavy songs. One of the things that made Endless Ocean's songs stand out most was its use of minimalism with vocals. The way they used the mid-register to convey each vocal vocal note to the vocalizer, so the notes/mics on each vocal note felt slightly natural and added a lot of natural "accent" to the songs. It's a really strong piece and not too much of a stretch.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Yup. The best of the genre, and definitely up there with Myst and Riven as the best game ever released in the genre.
-----
Cess007: I didn't know that Endless Ocean used to be on a full Metroid soundtrack. That's pretty cool.
-----
Dyle: It's on Spotify and I think that's the main reason I love it so much. The music is so short and to the point, and it's made for the most nostalgic itemization of the game's structure. For a game with a near silent protagonist and a generally interesting soundtrack, it's a great fit.
-----
Weiss: Best thing about Endless Ocean is the soundtrack.
-----
Jisgsaw: I love it so much. I'm very passionate about Endless Ocean.
-----
DNAbro: Endless Ocean was one of my top 5 favorite game OSTs of all time.
-----
scottbeowulf: I really like the music in this one. Definitely one of my favorite OSTs.

~!~The Making of Valiant Hearts: The Wolverine and the NBA Jam tourney

TheDanimal: It’s that time again! We’re happy to share our first interview with the makers of Valiant Hearts: The Wolverine, Sean Bean (of Westworld fame), and our first look at The Wolverine in the making of Valiant Hearts: The Wolverine!
Sean Bean, who is our marketing and publishing VP & GM at GGX, just went through some really exciting development and details on the making of Valiant Hearts: The Wolverine. He talks about the big and small behind-the-scenes steps in, including the time he and his team went through, and the reaction of the audience when they finally got the chance to play with Sean Bean. Listen below.
Sean Bean reveals that the game came to be, revealed that it was cancelled, that the team didn’t feel it was ready to go, and a surprise at the end of the panel reveals that the game is taking a break after the development team was able to fix a lot of things.
Sean Bean just went through some great interviews, including about working with GGX and working with the teams that made the game.
Sean Bean reveals that the game came out, and some surprises were not only lost but also found out about. The team found many things, even things that the audience wasn’t aware of, that the game wanted to put in the game that they were hoping it would.
This is just a small excerpt from the interview, but it’s worth noting as well.
As for the rest of the interview, it’s worth quoting just the name of the game and the rest of the important parts.
-----
TheDanimal: Fantastic, thanks for sharing!
The short version is that there’s a huge secret tournament that will pit the teams against each other in an arena inspired by The Monaco Games.
The winner will receive a platinum from the tournament, and the loser will have the opportunity to win their own copy of The Wolverine for the time being.
-----
TheDanimal: Yeah, it’s kinda crazy to me that Sean Bean is in the game and doesn’t even exist. I’m so thankful he’s back!
-----
TheDanimal: I’m kind of hoping they don’t though lol.
-----
TheDanimal: I think they

~!~RTTP: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Open Spoilers)

kadotsu: So after building my very first character in Breath of the Wild on a whim, I ended up playing it and beating it. It's probably a 9/10 game, but I ended up really liking it. I had some issues with it, but I ended up enjoying it more than I thought, and thought it was quite an experience.
I'm not sure if I could go back to it, but I'm not a big Zelda fan.
But when I started the game last week, I was kinda bored. It was slow paced and I had to break it down. I also finished some shrines, but that's it. I didn't go in as hard as I should have, and it was a jumbled mess.
I didn't like the fishing for items, I don't like them, I don't like them that much, but I like them anyway. I didn't like the open world, I don't like them that much. I didn't like the side quests, and I don't like them that much.
I finished some shrines and some shrines, and I started doing random stuff. I started doing some side quests, but those were just random side quests, and I didn't like them. I didn't like the fast travel system. I didn't like the parry system. I didn't like the puzzles.
I was kind of bored. I was trying to keep myself busy playing Zelda, but when I couldn't do it, I just stopped playing.
So I'm going to try and beat this game next week. I'm going to set the goal to beat it next week.
Maybe I'm becoming an expert in Zelda or something. I'm not bad at the games, I'm not amazing. I like to get my Zelda fix because the only reason I haven't been playing games for the past 10 years is because I was playing BotW. I like to try things I'm not interested in because I'm not interested in the games, but I'm starting to lose interest in games now.
I just want to give this game a chance, and I was surprised to find it's very unique and charming open world. I love open world games, and the world of BOTW is a cozy combination of beautiful and eerie. The only complaint I have though it might

Krejlooc: Because I really want to see a FFXV thread in here, I thought this would be a good opportunity for people to share their PSN handle games of the PS3 and PS4, ask them about their old consoles and console they used, etc.
I have indeed had a PS3 (haven't upgraded yet), but it's not the end of the world that we got to play on an old console, but I have now decided that I want to give it a go.
What's the best PSN handle for FFVIII and I haven't yet seen a FFIV thread, or seen one for FFXV and I have yet to decide if I want to play on it.
Also, what's the best way to play and avoid grinding? I could just play FFXIV and get the PS4 version, but I don't want to spend a lot of time grinding so I'm gonna stick to the PS3 version.
-----
Daffy Duck: I don’t think it’s the best depending on what you have are like. 
FFXV is the best way to play and can be played with no issues.
If you have any PS3s, that’s better.
-----
Riversands: PSN is the best option.
-----
Krejlooc: it's actually better. I haven't started it yet, so I will have to make up some ground in hopes that I get it right to eventually

SolVanderlyn is an incredibly long thread but I thought it'd be fun to share some of my experiences with some of these fabulous women.
Please tag spoilers.
-----
BassForever: I think it’s the character action game character action game. 
The game is mostly played in tournament mode, the voice acting is top notch, they have amazing chemistry and it’s really cool to see them become team mates when you are playing against each other, you get to see their relationship grow and develop as friends and it’s so much fun to play against them. 
I think the characters are great and the story is interesting. 
I would also like to hear some of the characters in general how awesome they are.
-----
Xiaomi: Are you playing the game with online or a friend with an online connection?
-----
Chaos2Frozen: The best way to play this is to get a PS4 Pro. I have the game and everything installed on the same SSD for the trophy cleanup.
-----
Mifec: Obviously, use the cloud save function.
-----
SolVanderlyn: I believe the best way to do this is using a PS4 Pro in a bedroom connected to a Wi-Fi connection.
-----
BassForever: Yup, I remember seeing this article about how the character action game was so much better playing on a PS4 Pro and still being a hassle to get a copy for a few bucks. 
I’ve always wanted to play the game but just never got around to it. Looking forward to hearing the responses to this thread.

====================
~!~Do you remember when the heart of a game fails?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): With most games I don't. I remember when I was young I didn't know I could go anytime without seeing a certain scene start and it just broke me. The beginning of Half-Life 2: Episode 1 happened to me and I knew I had to die. I didn't know I could go back to see that scene. I didn't know what'd happen. I didn't even know. It was a miracle of a game.
I remember dying at the beginning of Silent Hill 2. I was so happy, I cried my eyes out. I still do. But I know the feeling.
I remember feeling it when Dead Space 3 happened. I was so happy, I cried my eyes out. I couldn't believe I had to see the game. I just couldn't. I didn't know what it was about. I didn't know what it needed. I couldn't tell what it was. I couldn't tell what it had to offer. I was so happy, I cried my eyes out.
Dead Space 3. 
I know I'm in the minority. I feel this way for a lot of games. I'm not a huge fan of the way the first Dead Space came across the internet. It's a scene that earns the title "Mass Effect". I liked it. I liked it was a very good game. I continued to enjoy it. I picked up the PS3 version. I started the game again. I started at the beginning. I'm not a big fan of the way the first one plays. I think it's a bit like a "classic" JRPG. I don't think it's a difficult game. I think it's a bit like a 2D JRPG. I finished it. I'm not a huge fan of the way it plays. The sound of the enemies, the way the camera often points in the direction of the enemies. The stealth mechanics were not bad. I didn't mind the first one. I was a sucker for stealth. I disliked the way the game could sometimes build up to a story arc at times. It was a good game. I still think it's a bad game to this day. It's really a different game than the first. I think it's because of the way the game crafts its characters and story. It doesn't

~!~I kinda wish digital games had a way to reserve games?

EricOfSeattle: Something I've noticed is how much better I see the LRG catalog of games on sale on PSN. I've gotten about a 600 dollar bundle every time I go live and I feel like I have more shelf space on my big console by the end of the week.
Sure it's not like it's the end of the year but I feel like I've been missing out on a bunch of stuff already.
Something I've noticed is that I've been able to use my PSN account to buy a good chunk of PS4 physical games (which is awesome because I constantly see great deals and cheap deals for getting some), and that's great since I have a family subscription on my account and all my purchases are stored on that account.
I've also been able to use my My PSN password in the past on my PS4 and it's been great. I've also been able to use the My PSN password in the past on my PS4 and it's been great. I know some people say "not being able to use this past weekend" but I've noticed that it's been a more than just a scheduling issue. I've been able to use the weekend of my My PSN account (yes I'm 30) to play through all my games before the end of the weekend.
I've also been able to use My PSN password in the past on my PS4 and it's been great. I've also been able to use the weekend of my PSN account (yes I'm 30) to play through all my games before the weekend ends and the weekend ends too.
I've noticed that my brother-in-law is able to use the weekend of my PSN account as a "cashier" and to make use of it as necessary during my time playing games. I've also noticed that the account is not shared between accounts.
I've also been able to use My PSN password in the past on my PS4 and it's been great.
I've also been able to use my PSN password in the past on my PS4 and it's been great. I've also noticed that my account is not shared between accounts.

I thought we were doing this every year but I don't think anyone has ever done so in years.
Saw this on Facebook a few weeks ago and it was just as amazing as the first day it started.
There was something so small and charming about the event. You could pick your personality and it was an easy decision to pick the day you want to experience it.
I think we did it once before but usually folks just give up within a day or two.
Any other people pick?
-----
Soulflarz: I'm a gamer myself and only did it once, right after an early peak that wasnt crowded with people realising how pointless it was
-----
Vicious17: I came to the event with the goal to play and quit before it was over and thought the first half hour was a great experience. Ended up playing it all the way through and finishing it because I suck at online multiplayer. But I think the event itself was a great idea and that there were so many unique ways to experience the game, so many.
It was also way to late to the party at the beginning of the event so I was stuck at my desk halfway through and had to close the room because I was up early and nothing else was happening.
-----
Flagless: I was there for a few hours straight after that. I remember trying my best to get into the game and the people who were there just weren’t as good as I was led to the front desk.

Futaleufu: I can't believe I didn't know this was a thing. The staff (PSU, EZA) were always so irrelevant.

Kudo: EZA is still active, so probably not. How can you even even know it was a thing? It's not like it's a thing in the US, or even in the west.

I'd love to hear your opinions.

Krejlooc: I think you're missing a few games in that thread.
The Advance Wars is a very nice little series, I'd have no trouble playing through it. It's a lot of fun.
The WarCraft series was released in 1994, WarCraft 1994: Conquest and the first game is definitely worth playing.
I know a lot of people have played a lot of the Advance Wars through the years.
-----
Krejlooc: I actually started playing the Advanced Edition at a friends house a week or so after I got the Gameboy Advance. I remember it being very good.
-----
Krejlooc: Ah, I vaguely remember the WarCraft games. I remember having a blast with those.
The WarCraft games were great games, but you can't beat that map design and map guides. The Advanced Edition removes that stuff, adds a couple more of the maps you remember, and talks about how the mechanics for the WarCraft games are different from the rest of the game. It's a bit more of an adventure game, WarCraft is regular "story" missions, WarCraft 2 takes place in the main plot hub, and the rest of the WarCraft games have a part to play in the main plot.
-----
Krejlooc: Some of the games I played through a lot of the times were DS titles.
-----
Krejlooc: That's actually the first Advance Wars that I played. I'm pretty sure that was the SNES one. It was also the one that had a really nice gimmick to it.

~!~Just Cause 4: Avalanche's Smartest Approach to Stupidity Yet [Read OP]

dex3108: Title says it all. I love just cause 4 to bits. I love how the game made by Avalanche was the first sandbox game and then by Rockstar. This is probably the most sandboxy of them all and honestly it was nice to see it get a AAA sequel. I do agree that they were a bit too early with the tech allowing for ideas like the air raid and all that. But I still think this was one of the best things Rockstar has done to date.
I think it is Avalanches best approach. They nailed it.
-----
RagingAvatar: I'm always in love with just cause 4, and I'm so disappointed they decided to not make another one of those.
-----
Deleted member 11018: I really hope they keep the sandbox aspect as the main focus, and have the MP to further extend that aspect.
Reductantly, the sandbox portion of JC4 was so very limited in comparison to the main game, and I thought the game could only be played in more sandbox style, so it was a disappointment.
-----
8bit: My heart is still going down after missing so many details about the blast effects in the first one.
I was expecting "blast effects everywhere", but seeing as they had already made such ideas for JC3, I just got kind of happy thinking Avalanche and Rockstar were just tweaking and optimizing the concept for their sequel.
-----
Deleted member 11018: Yeah, it was really disappointing that they didn't show more of the blast effects and I just took those for granted as they were the only thing they had in mind for the presentation.
I really hope they try and go back to of what made JC1-3 great, and make it more sandbox-y.

~!~[Lets talk about the good, the evil, and silly)

HomokHarcos: I've been thinking about this a lot lately. Resident Evil 6 is one of my favorite games ever, and it's a shame that the remake version is coming to PS4 next week.
If you don't know what the game is, you probably haven't heard of the evil aliens from the first Resident Evil, or the evil molded from the first Resident Evil. We know that they are evil in one way or another, but we can at least talk about what they are and how to tackle them.
The Evil Ensemble from Video Games are a small team of fans who create the music for games and movies. One of the main reasons they are wholesome is because they love games, and I feel that you don't have to play with them to be part of the OST. I think the reason for that is that I feel that the first Resident Evils had a good balance of horror and action. For example, the first game had the great and iconic atmosphere of Silent Hill, but the second game's atmosphere was rather generic and bland. 
Now, I know that it's hard to describe, but I'd like to share my personal view about evil molded.
The idea of evil molded was first introduced in Resident Evil 0, and it's a series of puzzles that you solve in order to gain access to the dark gallery where we experience the evil molded. You can see this concept in this video:
You can also see what's lying about it in this video below:
You can see behind you, but you can only see what's scary:
Now, I think that the solution to this puzzle is always to attack the guard guarding the entrance to the secret exit. But I'm not here to discuss this. I'm here to talk about some of the evil molded's design, which you can only fight them to protect.
The Evil molded is one of my favorite designs in the Evil Within series, and this design is where it's at. You can win, but you only get to pick one evil molded at a time. You can pick one of three tome at a time and you can only take as many as you like. Evil molded is also where the evil plan was originally placed. You can create Evil molded to fight against the evil molded, and Evil molded can transform into Evil molded to fight against the evil molded

~!~XCOM-like game "Moonlighter" announced for Switch

Dardan Sandiego: Developed by independent studio Moonlighter and published by Adult Swim Games.
Official PR: 
Site: 
A demo is set to be released on Thursday, July 21. To be published by Adult Swim Games. 
Game Overview:
Based on the popular Wizardry series, Moonlighter is a turn-based strategy RPG game, with a wide range of spells and enemies. Moonlighter's new game mechanic is the 'repeat successes' system, where successes increase the depth of the board and the chances of succeeding increase the chances of the next success. Each success increases the chances of getting another successful turn, increasing the chances of success and making the board size one of the most densely populated areas in the game. Repeat successes are permanent losses to your whole team, and the more successes you gain the more chances of getting a second successful turn. Moonlighter's new game mechanic is 'multiplication', where each success increases the chances of getting the next successful turn, and vice versa.

Duffking: I want to be interested in this and I loved Wizardry, but I'm not really interested in XCOM games this time.

Aangster: Is it just me or are they really rushing to get this out the door before the Infinity War leaves?

Aangster: I liked the combat and the enemy designs, but I felt the enemy design overall was really bad. The gods were pretty cool, though.

~!~GameStop Yanks Most Expensive New 3DS Before Labor Day

Phantom Thief: SOURCE
The thing is, I don’t know if this is surprising or what I expected. The 3DS is still selling for a pretty penny, and the price is going up, but they want to keep the 3DS going, and if they’re able to keep the 3DS going, they will continue to sell it for the near future. So I suspect they still want to sell it to the very, very limited crowd that they are trying to keep going, and if they are able to keep the momentum going, they will continue to sell it more even after they sell the 3DS.
-----
Neutra: Well this is a twist that will definitely put a damper on my Pokemon game plans.
-----
Pablo Mesa: I wonder if this was just a surprise announcement or if amazon realized that nintendo is more willing to pay for the high end New models in sales than others was
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Fuck, I was hoping for the latter.
-----
Raijinto: Yeah I was wondering about this too. They really need to trim down their trade-in/retail segment if they're going to continue.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: Amazon just paid them to put the 3DS in the best sellers section.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think a lot of it is just their perception and perception alone.
Could be an increase in digital sales more than the physical, but I think it’s still pretty small.
I think it’s a bit early to expect that, especially since the 3Ds launched
-----
Phantom Thief: I think it's a pretty big number. It's actually a big deal.
-----
Lichtsang: Doesn't seem too big since I do consider New 3DS XL models to be cheaper and, as a result, I don't mind buying more 3DS XL hardware (which I bought new).
-----
Pablo Mesa: I am saving money and more 3ds games on the switch, I guess i can just sell it and not carry all the games on wii u

~!~Bought a PC and will play on a TV through HDMI?

"D.": I'm on a iMacbook Air, and I know the TV is capable of running macOS 10.14, so I would be OK getting a PC for it. I have an obvious one plugged in to the TV and it's working, but what if I plug in another HDMI to the TV through the TV? I know that the TV supports VGA, and I think I'm supposed to dip the TV remote into it to bypass that.
I have a problem.
I want to play AC Odyssey on a TV, but I can't because I can't set my PC to be plugged into the TV, and I have no HDMI ports at all.
I have a TV that can run AC Origins, but I can't connect it to my PC because I don't have a HDMI cable.
I have a TV that can play mouse and keyboard with Bluetooth, but it couldn't connect to my secondary monitor because it couldn't authenticate.
I have a TV that can run anything with built-in bluetooth and it can run anything with built-in bluetooth and it can run anything with built-in bluetooth and it can run anything with built-in bluetooth and it can run anything with built-in bluetooth and it can run it via the secondary monitor through HDMI.

~!~Is Sea of Thieves a better game than Sea of Thieves?

KrigareN-: "Sea of Thieves is better than both games combined. If you’re a hardcore game fan looking to scratch a few more holes than I did, I’d probably agree."
*For those who don’t know, Sea of Thieves is a game where you get to manage what ships you want in your row wars. The game's greatest strength is managing how your crew works for you in a good way, but the game also has the biggest variety of random items in the game. It’s also the best place to farm loot, since you only get one drop per week.
Sea of Thieves also has the most lootable dungeons, and the best (if you ignore the sharks and robots in dungeons).
I also like the variety of ship types on offer. The vehicles on offer have more variety than the ones on the game.

~!~LTTP: The Evil Within

JCHandsom: After originally getting it at launch and being told it was not for me, I finally decided to get around to playing it. I'm currently about a week in, and so far I've enjoyed my time so far.
I have to say, I'm absolutely loving the Evil Within. It's a very unique experience, and the combat, level design, atmosphere, puzzles and the overall story are quite strong. I loved the atmosphere, the music, the art and the art-style. The gameplay was smooth sailing, but man is the game a treat.
The level design, enemies and the levels were extremely well designed and were fun to play. The puzzles were really well integrated and I ended up being happy with them. The story was really well integrated, and the characters were memorable, the overall story was great, and the level design was a joy to play. The atmosphere was amazing, and I absolutely loved the music, which is an apt description of the game.
The overall story and characters for me were mostly:
Easy Allies:
The Escapists:
The Mummy Demastered:
I always thought these guys were great, and they really did go a long way to get the Survival Horror vibe that I thought they would.
The main antagonists were:
The Bunnarian Tree:
The Cult of the Dead:
The Railroad:
The Headldom:
The Bully:
The game had a lot of really fun enemies, and great level design. The first time I saw the Bully was must've, I thought it looked so fun. It really was a blast, and I'm very excited to play it cheap!
The overall story and characters for me were:
The Outsider:
The Moose:
The Railroad:
The Bunnarians:
The Drifter:
The Evil Within:
The Evil Within 2:
The Survival Horror:
I can't say I've ever been so excited for a game, and I'm really excited to play The Evil Within 2 this Friday. I'm looking forward to diving into this one as well.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I always loved this game.
-----
Gevurztraminer: I couldn't disagree more. I think the only thing that made the game special, for me, was the atmosphere, the atmosphere was amazing. So much so

~!~Best game characters

Xavi: I'm trying to think of a best game character. I am looking up Mario and Sonic in that list.

KZXcellent: GoW is the best game character.

-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Mario is the ultimate anti-hero

NKnight7: I don't think he's the best anti-hero protagonist.

TheFallenSaboteur: Oh, I just realized I actually think the character is named after a fictional anti-hero. /sarcasm
-----
Cess007: I do not see anything wrong with that. He is a natural.
-----
Syril: I think it's more of a marketing point, because in that sense it's the one against the player.
-----
Xavi: I'm actually surprised they didn't go with the name Mario.

Nakenorm: Yeah it's a funny decision, but I think it's a bad pun.

~!~"The Last Remnant" is one of the best games of all time, everyone should play it

TheGhost: I recently had a pleasant discussion with a friend and he has been recommending "The Last Remnant", to anyone who has never heard of this game.
It is a stunning game. The atmosphere, the setting and the art style are both top notch, reaching an almost unimaginable level of composition. The soundtrack is also among the best in the last generation.
Just look at this gif!
Now, I have to go to a store and buy it to get him ready for another shot at it. But he was talking about the music and not the game himself. He really liked it.
How about you?
-----
Fat4all: I'm so fucking in
-----
Joey Pockett: i tried to play it but i'm failing my way through
-----
TheGhost: I think it's a really good game. The story, the pacing and the way the music shifts around are both brilliant.

Jym: I'd be interested in a full refund if they changed the battle music.
I remember playing it a little too much and never got far...

Duxxy3: The last Remnant is a good game.

~!~Why does Super Mario Odyssey have so many bad bugs?

Meelow: I just finished playing Super Mario Odyssey on the Switch and while I love the game, I don't love the bugs. Many bugs. 
I am almost 100% sure there are at least 30 bugs in this game. 
Is it because of the terrible framerate? Music issues? Animation issues? Characters not moving correctly? I have never played this game before, but I heard the bugs are pretty bad too. 
I think the game is so bad that I don't want it to be fixed.
-----
Mediking: It's the worst Mario game I played.
-----
Xiaomi: The framerate issues aren't the worst, but it's certainly not "bad".
-----
BronsonLee: What exactly are you talking about

Neiteio: yeah it's bad for the most part, but it's still quite playable and fun for coop

TwinBahamut: That's what everyone was saying.

mikezilla2: it's a great game.

hydruxo: I love the game to death but the damn bugs are annoying. Especially when you have the two flippers.
-----
NotLiquid: It's not the worst but the bugs are fucking annoying. Like, I refuse to use coins because there's a coin in a chest and it's bolted to the edge, and I swear if you move it straight up it'll slide down. There's no way to avoid it, and I've only been able to dodge 10% of the way into a star with my flippers because I kept having to run and block and stuff before getting it right (you can dodge and hit the star with your flippers and that's it).

Lonely1: He's not wrong.
-----
Raijinto: Turing makes it sound like VR is the huge open world VR project lying right at the moment the competition to have the holy king of the high end consumer VR game is codenamed.
-----
Durante: It makes sense, but I expect VR games to have a long way to go before VR becomes the biggest gaming thing, at the end of the day.
-----
Strings: I don't think Turing is a bad developer by any means, but I feel like VR is probably a much better direction (and it's not the best system to push for adaptive controllers, but the devs are still making games that do it well) for a company that's already aiming to do things well.

~!~How was Sega Ages? Sega Ages is a great Sega Ages game

Krejlooc: Sega Ages is a classic, and it's kind of a shame that the Sega of America hasn't been the same since. I've always been a big fan of the Sega of Japan's titles, and Ages games have very good production values.
Sega Ages is a fantastic Sega Ages game and I really appreciate that they've continued to support the series. I'm extremely excited to play more Sega Ages games as I feel like I do every year on ResetEra.
So, how do you feel about Sega Ages?
-----
Funyarinpa: I've been playing it a lot over the past month and a half and I've been enjoying it a lot.
I really like the presentation, and I think it's a great (if very old school) title for the Sega of Japan console.
-----
Krejlooc: They did make a pretty big splash when it first launched, first with the Sega Ages ports and then with the Sega Ages mini-ports, which are great. Funny that they haven't changed the presentation since then.
-----
Funyarinpa: I actually really like the SEGA Ages cast.
-----
Krejlooc: Yeah, I think the fact SEGA is doing a new SEGA Ages release is important to understand.
-----
Krejlooc: Yeah, but they never change the characters or the game from what I know. They just change a lot of the animations and effects and effects.
-----
Krejlooc: It's a good game. Even though it is a much older game it is still a good time. It starts off a lot slower, but the game is still fun to play.
-----
Krejlooc: Plus the lot of older video game content, not to mention the fact that it's a lot more violent than any other "classic" SEGA game, was a big part of why it received so much love.
-----
Krejlooc: Theres even some text boxes in the PS2 version that will let you switch to a different voice if someone picks it up. It runs at a smooth 30fps and looks like a modern graphical powerhouse at the time.

~!~I will NEVER be good enough to finish Dark Souls 3 [Update]

TheFallenSaboteur: I know some people will respond with the question "will it ever be good enough to finish Dark Souls 3", but I believe that is a much better question. I need to finish Dark Souls 3.
I recently completed Dark Souls 3. It was a difficult and rewarding experience, but I attempted to do everything as fast as possible. I couldn’t say “this is my favorite game of all time. I can’t give up.”
The first time I had to do this was the first time I felt truly proud of my achievements. I was still a young teen when I completed the game. But I felt that playing this game was a mark of me – a game I was proud of my – and it was a mark I could start again. I felt like I was mastering the game and knew I could go and I would. I knew that it would be difficult to go back to the beginning, but I still had to go hard.
I still remember the summoning enemies and the pain they caused me. But then I finished the game. I did not feel so much shame, but I knew that unlike the other souls games I still could not beat the final boss. I was in the Silvermoon and found it to be a joyous place. There were many rewards in there. And the Demon King. He was well worth the sacrifice.
And now I am done.
I have finished the game. Four bosses now. The boss fight is now over and I have returned to my senses. I can now go back to the Silvermoon and see if I have lost in my ways.
But I still have to finish Dark Souls 3.
Have no idea what the final part of the final boss is like. I know it doesn’t mean much when I think about it but it was still a fucking chore. And it didn’t help that games with such things have such bosses.
Most recently I fired it off to a menu screen and it was still there. I left the area and went to another area. Did not see anything. And when I looked around I couldn’t find a ladder leading down to the final boss. It must have died.
I have no idea what it was. It was the Dark Souls 3: Blood Gifts.
I followed the Lagi

~!~In the Name of Lord, Set Balance, and Rules of Monster World, what should the Monster World formula receive MORE of MORE of?

SolVanderlyn: I'm often feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of the Monster World formula. I've already played through every Monster World game and I have a few hooked. Primarily, a collection called Monster Tale Untold 1, with the expansion and DLC. 
I have a question for y'all. How should the formula be improved in the Monster World formula? Are there any options to play the games in the correct order, or do I just have to go through the motions? 
Also, if my poor ass friends can only really scratch the surface of the Monster World formula and get better, what gives?
-----
wafflebrain: I've always liked the more abstract and abstract aesthetic of the original Monster World. I'd like for them to go for a more playful look and instead focus on actual puzzles rather than simple logic. I want them to do something more unique and abstract.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Badass. Make sure they're still pumping out new entries. Though I do hope they're doing something unique too. Give me RuneScape over this weird shmup like that.
-----
TheNotoriousAFG: I really like the structure of the formula, but as long as they keep the same 3D brawlers with a focus on puzzles I'm in.
-----
FF Seraphim: I really like the structure of the formula now. If they keep the same structure I might like it.
-----
BasilZero: I agree with you.
I really hope the next entry in the franchise is better than the one after that
-----
SolVanderlyn: The only thing that really bugged me was how the camera worked in the tutorial. Is there any way to rotate the camera beyond that?
-----
Sgt. Demblant: I can't wait for the next one. I love the structure of the formula and I LOVE the identity of the monsters.
But the formula has changed.
For example, the Gremlins were monsters.
For this reason I welcome more “Monster Girl Ninja” entries.

~!~Rumor: Sony is working on PS Now streaming services

RevengeTaken: Today, we heard that the PlayStation Now streaming services (PS Now, Now streaming) app has been announced by Sony Entertainment and subsidiaries White Owls and TPCi. 
More details were revealed in today’s announcement of the streaming services. 
These streaming services are being developed with the input of Sony Japan Studios, a new joint initiative between Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo. With this app on their console, they are able to stream their games to a second device, using only a smartphone. The app will launch in Japan in late January 2019 according to the accompanying article.
The benefits of using a smartphone for this kind of service will be offered exclusively to the number of users. Other streaming services, including Game Streaming, have been on the rise but have been stagnant for a few years.
According to the announcement, Sony Japan Studios and Sony Computer Entertainment (now a subsidiary of Nintendo), are developing a “first party game streaming” service based on the PlayStation Now™.
The streaming service will launch in Japan in late January 2019. PlayStation Now streaming services are being developed with the input of Sony Japan Studios, a new joint initiative between Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo

====================
~!~Why do we have so many good ports and re-releases on Switch?

SuperNerd3000: I feel like people were always going to be open to porting more than they already are to other consoles. But porting to Switch feels like the inevitable demise of what was once the best version of a genre
I've been replaying Bayonetta 1, and I actually enjoyed the sequel a lot. It's a very good game but there's a lot of backtracking, collecting enemies, finding weird mini puzzles and engaging combat. But the main reason this port is so bad is because it's so bare bones is because of the lack of a proper analog stick. There's only so many enemies you can carry in your sword/shield or whatever and even the minigames are barebones. The combat is what makes this game worthwhile, but the port in every way is not very enjoyable. The levels are small, but they feel just not fit for the Switch. There are button remaps to the camera, but they're so bare bones and the controls feel off. The story is really dull. The side content is pretty much non-existent, but that's fine, at least.
I'm much more interested in this port than the Bayonetta games because the quality ports of these games are really good.
-----
Imran: Because Nintendo isn't involved in the development process and they don't have to prove their quality.
-----
Grapezard: I love the Bayonetta series, but I just can't seem to get behind Bayonetta. The Switch port was the first step, but the performance was really bad and the presentation was just plain bad. I really wish they'd given Nintendo more resources to develop their next games.

Cartridge Games: Because Bayonetta’s like a digital enhanced port of Bayonetta/2/3/4/5

~!~What are your gaming dreams for 2019?

Dartastic: I've been on a gaming binge recently, and while I'm pretty excited about it, I feel like a lot of the things I'd like for 2019 could also be more palatable to others.
With Sony and Nintendo basically winding down and EA about to fully retire my interest in their respective franchises, I've been thinking about what my next gaming binge could be. I'm thinking about my gaming dreams for 2019, and how I feel like it could be a great opportunity for my resume and future careers to play games.
First of all, I'd like to thank Fonrari most, my favorite developer for many years. I love to see their games and I love them for it. 
I'd like to also thank Aonuma and TeeCee for helping me with this thread. Between this thread, this thread, and this one where I post some of my gaming memories that I'd never otherwise get to experience.
I'd like to also thank Hey! Onix for making a game that I absolutely loved and appreciating it as much as I did. I had so many opportunities to play with the developers, and they made my gaming room feel like a high class living space. The atmosphere of living in and playing with the people who made this house was just so good. It's a shame that the game industry has fallen so far this year, but I hope that the rest of the year it improves!
We're gonna be coming back with Two Point Hospital in January, right? I know that the game's been in development for a year or so, and it just came out last year. I'm not sure what's going on with development now. Maybe it's being done right at Sony's offices, or maybe they're switching things over. I don't know. I'm kind of unsure!
-----
henhowc: I’m in the process of transition to a new 3D world which is exciting but not certain. I loved the first game and I may eventually give it another chance. I’m also interested in the new world.
-----
Dartastic: Thanks for the advice, I'll thank you later.
I'm in the process of transition. I love the game and I have my hands full with playing it on the Switch.

~!~iPad vs. 3DS: should I upgrade my 3ds to a pro? Currently, iPad gaming is pretty much nonexistent in handheld gaming. I have the 3DS here but I'd be okay with passing the pro.
-----
Ababol: I don't think that's an issue. I have an iPad and use it primarily in docked mode. I like the 3DS a lot but I'm not a huge fan of the screen.
-----
Noppie: I'd highly recommend you upgrade your 3DS, it's a great device, great screen and better apps, with a better screen tearing.
The price of a Pro doesn't make sense to me.
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: It's better for you. I had that issue with the 3DS. It was a bit of a pain to setup when playing through DS games, but the novelty wore off pretty quickly. 
I don't think it's a big deal because the 3DS is a flagship device all the way to the end of the gen, and the 3DS is a major staple when it comes to gaming.
-----
JINX: Your best bet is to have a second 3DS and a second tablet. You may also want to consider a Switch. (If your Switch doesn't have a dock already draining a bit, I'd recommend you wait for a Pro to get one without a doubt)
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: How's the battery situation? I have both a Pro and XL and each one is suffering from burn in. I've had the XL since launch and the 3DS XL since launch and the 3XL since launch and both are a real pain in the ass to play. I'm wondering if I should wait a bit more and see if the 3Ds battery life goes back in stock with the Pro or if it's just a waste of money.
-----
InsaneLuchador: The 3DS is a huge upgrade. I am still rocking my regular 3DS. I don't think the 3Ds are particularly long lasting either.

~!~The best DQ MMO of the generation is finally here

Zen: I've been playing Dragon Quest XI since the launch of Final Fantasy XIV. Dragon Quest MMO has had a very long and involved development history and I feel like it had its beginning and end in the summer of 2016.
Over the year that went by, I began to really wrap my head around the concept and how it could work. I started up a new thread for the game and began to investigate other other's ideas and I began to think about how the game could work as a JRPG.
I started off by playing a bit of The Witcher 3. I already knew that it had a story to tell, but I didn't know that was even the same concept. I started up a short bit of Dark Arisen and was about halfway through the first world map. I was pretty surprised by the game's quality and how it could branch off from the main story.
The main difference, though, was that the game was paced really well. I was playing it for 20-30 minutes at a time and felt engaged with the feeling of the world. I had some moments where I started to "wait", or point out the next area because of some plot device or whatever. I finished the game and felt very engaged with the world.
Recently, I purchased Dragon Quest Builders 2. I played a bit of the first game and I had a lot of fun with it. I just started to play the second game and just felt like, "Man, this is so much more than I expected", and when I play the third game, I feel like I'm blown away by the quality. The quality of life improvements are noticeable in the second game and I'm just really amazed and overwhelmed at how much I've enjoyed the game so far.
I'm not really sure what to make of the new system that allows you to create towns and upgrade your character. I don't know if the new system is called Guild Wars or A Realm Reborn, but I have to admit that I'm enjoying the guild system a lot. I'm not sure if I'll give up my character control options in DQXI. I don't know if I'll beat the game or not in a few hours if the guild system is still there.
So, I'm really excited to play Dragon Quest XI. I'm also not sure if I'm going to get all the characters in the game. I

~!~I bought a PS4 Pro in preparation for Destiny 2 Forsaken - what did I get?

I KILL PXLS: I bought a PS4 Pro for the campaign of Destiny 2: Forsaken. I'm not sure if I should have or not but I did enjoy the game a lot more than I thought. I've never played a Destiny game before. I'm not that big of a Destiny fan. I only have played Destiny 1 and 2 for the campaign. I don't normally play multiplayer games but this time I thought I'd try it. I'm a very casual player but I kinda liked the campaign. I've never played a Destiny game before. I made my own gear and purchased the appropriate amount of points for each slot.
I'm not sure if I should have picked up Destiny 2 Forsaken since I'm just getting there or not. I was going to get the PS4 myself but I just don't have the space. I would have been more into it. 
So what's your story with this game? Please no spoilers below.
-----
Possumowner: I got it to play some matches online then deleted it.
Had fun with it,but it did get quite repetitive and frustrating.
-----
FairyEmpire: It's a decent game, but the novelty wore thin when I was in it for a few months. I'm sure I'll stick with it again soon enough, but in the meantime I'd like to know how well it's received. I may have played it a bit when it came out, but didn't really dive into it.
-----
Kalentan: I played the demo and liked it, bought the full game and Forsaken week after. However, once I beat the first mission, I really didn't enjoy the rest of the DLC, the game kind of just wrapped up after that first misstep.
-----
Chivalry: It's the first Destiny, after the TTK grind.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I didn't play for a little while but the rest of the time I was able to stick with it. I think I enjoyed it more than the expansions since they swapped out some things from the main game.
-----
I KILL PXLS: I feel like I'm missing a good portion of the game. I feel like I'm just playing a somewhat shallow D2. It's the first shooter I've really been interested in since Destiny

~!~VAESEN - The First Ever World War.

Redneckerz: Posted on behalf of LucasMack
One of the great things about the Valkyria Chronicles series is that it approached us at the makers of the games in the vein of Gundam and Assasins Creed.
We started the franchise with a lot of hesitation, but we set out with nothing but resolve.
After struggling to find our own niche in the food chain, our team set out in an epic, personal journey, filled with heartfelt stories, filled with history, and filled with humour.
We set out on a journey that must now cease to exist.
We are Virgin Sins.
We are united by the common cause to end World War.
Who will survive?
Siren
A Fungal, Bloodthirsty, Sinophobic Garbage.
Neither is mine.
Neither can be saved.
They are the only Ones we know.
Their sole purpose is to watch over the World Population.
Their sole plan is to exterminate the world.
And so on.
It was all a noble plan.
These plans fell to our absolute complete failure.
The world has been so terrorized by the horrors of World War I, that we have been left to wane, and are forced to retreat.
Their sole purpose remains in the background, with the World Population being their only resources.
They must work to keep humanity alive.
Their greatest master was Daigo Kasuga.
They had gained amazing powers, but the Terran virus wiped them out.
In this new world, there are no remnants of their old allies, and their only friends were Usagi Kasuga.
The World Population has been wiped out.
The only hope of humanity left is an isolated position in a vast Hyboria.
A place known for the horror that comes to life.
A place for the victorious fighters that won the war.
So we are a band of heroes,
And we do not end our glorious resolution to make the World War.
We are not worthy to be World War III's victors.
The future of humanity is threatened with the most dangerous, and undefended threat to ever come.
It is for this reason that our World War III master, Daigo Kasuga, is born.
Daigo Kasuga is the only survivor of the Valkyries.
Daigo Kasuga is the

~!~Would you be interested in a Dark Souls Collection?

Terraforce: Title pretty much says it all. There is a ton of room for improvement in this game. Lots of things to do, tons of ways to go about doing it, and I am pretty sure there is a Dark Souls III Collection in the works.
If not a Dark Souls III Collection, what would you be interested in seeing?
I personally would be intrigued by the world of Dark Souls. It is a remarkable experience.
-----
Mediking: Oh yeah. I'm in.
-----
Funyarinpa: No. I think there would be too many things I'm not interested.
-----
DontHateTheBacon: No.
-----
Jawmuncher: Well if they want me to play Demon Souls and Bloodborne then it has to be Sekiro.
Would love to try out something new though. 
I think the Soul stuff is one of the better new experiences out there.
-----
Kyros: Disagree.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Not at all. While I enjoy the world and the lore, I do think it's a bit too much, and the way it's presented too frequently. I feel like if I were given a choice I'd try a Dark Souls Collection. I guess I could try my luck with some new folks on Era, but I'd be fucked if I went straight to Sekiro.
-----
Napalm_Frank: No. I don't think Souls games are for me.
-----
Green Slime King: No. 
I would say Sekiro, but I do think the new people that join the Dark Souls team if they were on this collection are a bit too fresh for me.

~!~The Verge - The best way to play games?

HueyFreeman: Hi everyone, I just hit a wall while we wait for the best version of The Verge's mobile game 'The Verge'. I'm enjoying it, but still, I'm getting the feeling that I'm playing a game, not actually playing it.
I'm thinking of starting a podcast, which is to say, the best way to play games. I'm wondering if this is really a thing for me because it seems like what I'm doing right now is far more interesting than some of the stuff I'm doing on ERA. I just had a discussion about this with Bill Wedes, game director on Starlink and they had a ton of helpful tips for me like:
- Don't focus so much on the things at the end of the game. Focus on what you do REALLY care about and really focus on what you're gonna get from the end of the game.
- A very short game for a mobile developer sounds like a great time to start playing the game. It's a few months from October and I don't know if Apple's new mobile plan will give me more of a reason to start playing now.
- I would also like to hear from some of the devs/pubs who are playing this. What are their strategies, etc.
- How do other mobile games even work?
- How do you feel like a podcast? Which devs/publisher do you feel like a real badass playing a game and which ones do you like?
- If I've learned anything from this post, it's that there's a lot of solid advice out there for anyone starting a podcast.
I'm still trying to figure out the basics of how to use. I'm trying to think up of things to do in a podcast, or preferably start a podcast if I'm interested.
So, if you guys have any questions that maybe no one can help with, I'll be happy to provide them.
Thanks, everyone! I think that this thread will be interesting to hear from you!

~!~How to make a good Kingdom: Two Crowns?

TheBeardedOne: The last time I played Kingdom was when I got PS Plus a few months ago, but only managed to finish it with Tokyo Xanadu Ex+. I think it's my favorite game in the series, though I'm a sucker for all of the ecchi settings. I liked the story, characters, and a good dose of charm. But things I've been noticing lately have gotten me in the zone I can't put down playing Kingdom.
I've been playing Last Rank with a friend a few times, and we're having a blast with it. So far we're liking the fights, but we've been having a lot of "Why are you fighting?" moments, and I think that's about it. Are there combos for us to try and use? Also, what's the best way to prepare? We're both veterans in the Romance~Comixa genre, and I'm not sure if that's different from Romance Tactics. We both enjoy RPGs, but we don't really get into the ones that we do.

~!~The best story in a video game

SolVanderlyn: I've been playing through The Wonderful 101 and it's been really engaging.
It's a game that was kind of a clearing the field with friends.
It's a game that told a story.
It was a pretty short game, but had a solid gameplay loop.
It's a game that is mostly about the journey, and the journey itself is told in a comic.
It's a game that is a sort of moving dystopia.
It's a game that is designed in a way that is coherent but isn't just a walking simulator.
It's a game that is meant to move the tools you are trying to accomplish and use them to create a better future for the planet.
It is a game, and it's meant to be taken seriously.
It's a game that is meant to be played from beginning to end.
It's meant to have a great story and a fun gameplay mechanic.
It has a very clear and logical story with a convoluted, yet informed story.
Where did all this come from, exactly?
I know there's an old thread on it, but as a kind of a complement to all the other great games out there, this deserves to be in the conversation.
-----
Omar310: I think it's a great game, just as good as it was at the time it came out but it's definitely not as good as some of the other Telltale games. Story is a bit dry and the ending is kind of dry but it doesn't get too much better than that.
That said, I think the best way to describe it is that it's a third person game and it has no markers. You can literally just see the enemy and don't find an icon on the ground.
-----
Jawmuncher: I agree with you on the walkthrough. It’s pretty tedious and the ending portion is just overall dull most of the time. 
The story though has some great moments.
-----
SolVanderlyn: The ending is the best part of the game for me. It's great.
-----
Pascal: I liked it quite a bit, but I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes of the game. Was very short and easy and ended up being a chore in the last 20 or so minutes.

~!~What's your favorite Final Fantasy Battle Network Experience?

J2ed: We can't have a definitive answer, but I'd like to kick this off by saying that Final Fantasy Battle Network (known as FBA) is my favorite Final Fantasy Battle Network Experience. I don't think it's as popular as other battle network games, but I think it's something really special.
This is a mashup of the two main games: Final Fantasy Battle Network and Battle Network Heroes. They're really simple games in the vein of normal online games like Mobius Battle Network and FFXIV Battle Network, while Heroes tries to mix things up by having characters fight against one-another viaairs. There's a lot to dig into, so let's break it down.
All menus are divided into screenshows, and can be used to quickly shuffle the tracks in and out of the arenas. There are a lot of arenas, but not much dedicated thematic in common; there's the 'gold-to-level' thing, which appeals to me. There's a lot of real-time strategy to play around with, since losing can be tough with a solid team. Unlike other Battle Network games, you can also try to crown you with items. If you're up for a challenge, there's a lot to do in the arena.
I love that this is about FBA versus battle royale, and that the private arenas have other features like private matches with friends for example.

~!~I'm just starting to get into Pokemon games. Anything I should know before I start?

John Doe: I'm starting to get into Pokemon games but I'm not sure if I should start with the newer ones or if I should continue to keep my eyes out for new ones.
I'm a huge fan of Blue and Yellow and I know what to expect from it. 
I know that the main game is still a Pokemon game.
I know that Let's Go Eevee is still a mainline entry.
I know that Pokemon Lets Go is more of a spin off than the original 151.
Any tips that I would like to know beforehand? How long is the game? Is the difficulty varied? Is there a competitive mode like Let's Go competitive?
-----
ASaiyan: I'm not planning for Let's Go. It's more of a mix of mainline and Let's Go where you unlock new evolutions and starter Pokémon.
-----
Xavi: Don't start with the newer ones. They're still fantastic games and should be played by as many people as possible.
-----
Cess007: There are new ones coming out soon.
The games are still in early access, you are free to play with any avatar you like.
You can change your avatar any you want.
The newest Let's Go batch is easier to understand since you can choose which Pokemon you want to catch (pokémon or wild pokemon).

I started the first Let's Go with a friend but it really didn't help. We played 3 hours or so to an hour each in.
-----
Spamlynguist: Yes, start with 1-2 years instead of 6-12 years.

Xavi: I'm starting with the newer ones but I'm not sure if I should continue with older ones, so 6-10 years.

~!~What are some good games to play in the middle of a difficult section?

Masterspeed: I've been playing games for a long time and this one is new to me. I don't know what the genre is, what does it do, or even good art styles to use. 
It really is just fun to play and the hardest part is the challenge, I'm just trying to figure it out and get it into my head. All I really know about this genre is that it's all about the rhythm. Nothing really seems to fill the same spot in my head, I get my fill of all the games in a row with the genres I wanna play in this. 
A lot of my games have just been about the same. They have the movement and the soundtracks, the boss fights have the music in it, the length of the chapters have the challenge levels/mid/late game has the music in it, etc. 
But my question is, what are some good games to play in a short amount of time?
-----
Viking Jesus: The Last of Us, Ground Zeroes, and Heavy Rain are the ones I can recommend.
-----
LonestarZues: Part Time UFO always sounded amazing and the game was just so cute.
-----
Kuro: Ground Zerpley is a wonderful experience.
-----
BubbleButt64: I remember being really excited for the 1 hour in The Last of Us when it first came out because it looked so good and the footage looked really good...but then I watched a friend play it (and it was hilarious) and now I want it more haha..
-----
Rekubot: Last of Us is a very emotionally affecting, touching and emotional experience. To me it's the first game I've ever cried/watched/partnered/partied to my younger self.
-----
Weltall Zero: This is one of my favorite games. I've only finished a few, but I remember that game being hell for me at times.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: The Last of Us is one of the most emotional and well told experiences ever :)
I love playing games in short bursts, like these.
-----
DriftingSpirit: Ico and Journey are perfect for this.
-----
Zukkoyaki: Ground Zeroes is a great and well-made adventure game

~!~Yasumi Matsuno should be working on something for the next Zelda

Busaiku: I'm not an expert about judging, but I have no idea what he's been working on.
He's been tinkering away in the UE4 engine for the most part.
It would be interesting to see what he has in the pipeline.
-----
hussien-11: Did he do any console work before?

Busaiku: No.

~!~Does anyone know if there will be a home port for the Switch in 2018?

Cow Mengde: I think it's just a matter of time. We haven't seen a Switch port in a while. I think next year is going to be the year we see a Switch port. I am not really sure if the PS4 and Xbox one are coming too. I just think we'll see something announced closer to E3, or a launch window release. What do you guys think?
-----
JazzmanZ: I don't think so.
I think it'll be a bundle.
-----
Fat4all: I really hope there's a Switch port
-----
DarkDetective: I think there will be a few. The 360/PS3 is right there, but the Switch is the first platform that has the exclusives on it.
-----
skittzo0413: I think there will be a couple. I think that is going to be announced alongside spring or summer in Japan.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think there's only a chance in “we’re still cooking the launch stuff for a possibility of a port” honestly. 
But I can't see a reason to believe it isn't coming.
-----
UmbriaPauly: oh shit. I want to play this game
-----
JoDa: Probably a PS4 bundle or maybe a Switch bundle
-----
Nopon_Merchant: I doubt there will be a port but i trust them
-----
Cow Mengde: They wouldn't announce it for a couple of months. The PS4 and X1 wouldn't be announced until E3.

Nirolak: Source:
-----
AzerPhire: Shame FIFA moved to the UK, Battlefield V had a better debut then FIFA 18.
-----
Patitoloco: I'm expecting Battlefield V to sell a lot more in the UK.
-----
Nirolak: Yes. FIFA's sales were very strong in the UK in the first two months of 2019, and then not so strong in the beginning of 2020 (they forecasted a 2m sellthrough in the first three months of 2020).
-----
Kromx: I think EA deserves some of the blame for that terrible E3 presentation.
-----
JakeNoseIt: They're the ones complaining about lack of software, right?
-----
Kenzodielocke: Tax returns!?
-----
Memento: Great result for FIFA.
-----
Lelouch0612: Great result for FIFA.
-----
Patitoloco: I'm surprised they didn't just continue the 1M forecast beforehand, it took about a year from January to March.

~!~RTTP: Killzone: Shadowfall

Comrade Doggo Sparky: Short Story :
I've been on a bit of a kick right now, the first of many long standing hangups (like the game says, I took a break after the first boss fight on Gunder Mantis in 2014) but I've gotta say that this game is surprisingly enjoyable.
It's a refreshingly difficult game, well done in most aspects, it's also wonderfully cohesive, you don't have to load a save anywhere (save spots can be easily identified when you're fighting anything which is great for a first time though) and it's a good change of pace from the typical point and click adventure games.
I've already sunk 15 hours in, I'm halfway through Mercenaries and the first mission.
The game's biggest problem was the fucking QTEs, they felt like they had to be repeated over and over, a shame because I'm in for a ride.
I'm going to paint my eyes on this mission:
The QTEs are some of the worst in the genre, you have to press them at least once to just dodge some of them, although on some you just HAVE to wait for the animation to finish. I'm not sure if it's just the frame rate or if I'm just being ridiculous here, but QTEs on QTEs are horrible. The frame rate is also horrible.
The enemies, while decent, don't get me in, at all. Like I said before, they'll flop right?
Anyway, what was your experience so far?
-----
Hektor: I'd be more keen on Shadow Tactics OP
-----
Comrade Doggo Sparky: I guess you're right, that game is fucking terrible.
-----
Jawmuncher: Played it a few years back. Liked it a lot and was hoping some others had the chance to give it a shot. Ended up buying it on PS4. 
You actually have to do them the QTE prompt once but the QTE itself is pretty lazy. It's dumb and expects you to press a few button to replay the QTE prompt by the very second.
-----
Comrade Doggo Sparky: Tbh I was gonna get it on ps4 but I don't wanna give the game the thumbs it panned through. I could care less about that stupid Deathclaw one.
====================
~!~I'm getting a Donkey Kong "hold up" accessory for the 3DS and I'm all in..

Mr Moot: I'm going to be a bit slow with the updates to my 3DS, but I've been itching to play one of those "mystery" shrines like Tropical Freeze. I've heard that some games have trouble with the power-ups, and I've heard that the same thing happens with some of the 3D Donkey Kong games. So I'm a bit intrigued.. will I be able to use the shrines in my 3DS? I'd love to hear about the shrines in particular.. I know some of them are puzzles, and I've heard that some are just platform puzzles, but I'm not sure if that's the only way to describe them. I know that you can fuse them, but I don't know if it's a better solution than a hard puzzle.
-----
Dreamboum: There aren't any shrines in the 3D Donkey Kong games. The only DK game that has shrines is DK Jungle Beat and that. That's about it.
-----
Cartridge Games: Yeah, you can use them in platform puzzles.
You can leave them in order to solve them, tho

====================
~!~Will we see the release of the first The Witcher 3 for the Xbox One X?

Alucardx23: I mean, we know that CDPR are working on an exclusive material for the console, but with it being the most recent console release, is it safe to assume that the console will launch with only a PS4 Pro version of the game?
-----
hydruxo: I don't think it'll be at launch.
-----
jacks81x: What's the source of the info that the game won't be on Xbox?
-----
Alucardx23: I don't think it's current gen. We don't know what the differences are with the PS4 version.
-----
Aokiji: I don’t think so. This year is PC47
-----
Akai: I'm not sure I understand the point of this thread, but I would assume that the game won't be on PS4 Pro.
-----
Loudninja: Imo. Probably not early on Xbox.
-----
Bits N Pieces: I'm hoping that's not a common view.
-----

Strings: I'd bet it'll be on PC, but as far as early console games go, it's not a common view.

Hate: Hey guys! 
I’m in for a wild ride.
Is the game worth playing if I get into it? 
I’ll give my own guesses because I’m unsure. 
Any feedback?
-----
Grexeno: I believe so.
-----
Grexeno: Ahh good vibrations.
-----
Hate: I’ll give my own guesses. 
Yep, I’m under a hype and honestly I’m not even sure if I’m getting it.
-----
Kuro: I was expecting for the Vault Boy thing to be this is a private mission.
-----
HamCormier: I've been curious about it too. I'm sure I'll be in for a wild ride.
-----
Grexeno: The Vault Boy thing is only a private mission. No civilians, no special ability packs, quests, etc.

-----
Lant_War: I can't wait for the time when it finally arrives.
-----
vestan: That's a good point. I'm looking forward to the open world racer.
-----
Gig: Most open world racing game since Burnout Revenge. I feel like the Crew 2 is shaping up to be a fun, diverse, and refreshing racer. Can't wait to see what the team has cooked up for us.

~!~What is your favourite Pokemon franchise, and why?

KingOfDyslexics: With pokemon in their prime, the original Pokemon games were the go to for a new person for a quick laugh, learn new Pokemon and then get to evolve them. However, since their remake came out, the franchise is even better now with over 10x more Pokemon to care about, and a better variety in trainer choice.
Personally, I’m biased, but I love Sun/Moon too as well. I was never a fan of the original, and the new Pokemon games are just as good. I guess this is a less divisive franchise than Gen 4, but still. 
What do you think? Vote and discuss.
-----
WrenchNinja: The first 3 games are my favorites.
-----
Mediking: We're finally gen 4.
-----
Hootman: The Platinum games are the pinnacle of the series.
-----
Lusamine: Gen 3.
Gen 4 is my least favorite.
-----
Oddhouse: Very few games will hold my attention for the first 3 games.
Gen 1 is very imo the best and probably the best pokemon romhack.
Gen 3 I was really excited for.
Gen 4 was sooo boring.
-----
DecoReturns: I think the first 3 are really great. 
But I like 4. 
They have some really cool concept, but then they overstay their welcome. 
The only good part of 5 is the first two games are great.
-----
Lord of Ostia: I think most people (including me) hate Gen 1, it's a huge step in the right direction but it's still Pokemon GO.
-----
Moltres006: Best one for me is Sun/Moon, but I also like the idea of remakes.
-----
Soul Skater: I like exploration and pokemon. I like challenging. 
Best is when the game eventually dumps the idea and instead made a Pokemon RPG. This made me like the series a lot more. 
Sun/Moon is just so good.
-----

~!~Metroid Prime: Echoes on Switch will be the first of its type to launch on a Nintendo console

Hero of Legend: This was kind of expected and it's not like Nintendo would be the best fit for other platforms. But hey, Nintendo has said they are ready to support this on Switch and that's it.
-----
Punished Dan: I don’t think they’d do that for a Nintendo console release.
-----
Dancrane212: They've said they're still working on the game for a year or so.
-----
Hero of Legend: Sadly, the game will probably be cross-gen. Metroid Prime 4 and the sequels from that are.
-----
Lelouch0612: Yeah, it's not like Nintendo isn't releasing a "big" game for Switch at all.
-----
Raijinto: It's a little more than a year and a half since Prime 2 and they've been saying they weren't ready to support it for this many years yet.
-----
Cess007: Reminder, this is the last Metroid game for the Switch
-----
Raijinto: Ah, I didn't see that coming. Didn't see anything about Prime 4 happening so I am glad to report.

LordKano: Should be announced before E3.

Z-Beat: I know there's a few of us, but I've never seen a certain character in a Spider-Man game. We haven't seen him until the last moment in the game. Is he dead? Is he going to be back? 
I've always wondered about this character's fate. In the game, he's a lame, random guy who has nobody to save him. Is he out for a kill? Is the world ready for him?
-----
Kingpin Rogers: Nope
-----
Jaxar: I don't know what he looks like at this point. I've always found some sort of Enderhog in his.
-----
Weiss: I think the world has finally allowed it.

Cap G: It's the return of the Arkham formula.

~!~Is it time for Microsoft to put the original Xbox Games on the Switch?

Flagless: I know early access is a very long period, but with the Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Arcade stuff coming to Switch, I’d love to play it again.
-----
Theorry: If yes. Zelda and Assassins coming to Switch is a great idea.
-----
G_Shumi: I'd love it if they did something about a PS4 version too. The lack of backwards compatibility has me a little worried, but I'm sure there's a reason why Nintendo is taking that stance.
-----
Toumari: Sony need to get on board with the Switch.
-----
kambaybolongo: Yes
-----
ghostcrew: I don’t think you’d be able to play it on Switch.
-----
Revolsin: I'd be down for that.
-----
Xando: Yes.
-----
L.O.R.D: I thought the game was already on ps4?
-----
Tregard: I think they should consider making their previous console the Switch's home port, since they're the ones who own the IP and essentially run it's home console version, right? They could even port some of the older games to the Switch if they felt they could do it with their existing library.

~!~Is it time for a Red Dead 2 skin for collectors?

Coyote Starrk: Game is pretty expensive right now but if this is the one thing that is guaranteed to sell a collectors item for years, I think it's time for me to get one.
I've never seen a crappier L.A.T.E. outfit before. Pair it with some custom heavy rain and I'd be sure something would sell for some kind of insane amount!
-----
ronco2000: I think so. I think they'll probably sell one if it's big enough to warrant a collector's edition.

Coyote Starrk: I think we had this thread recently but I can't find a source for this rumor.

~!~MinecraftPocket - a Minecraft-like game that's coming to Nintendo Switch in Japan

Tizoc: Just saw this pop up on Twitter and decided it was worth posting. The game is called Minecraft Pocket, and is launching january 2019 in Japan. This is a mock-up version of Minecraft, with the addition of a hat and an achievement system.
More screenshots at the jump. The website is up and up for Japanese eShop.
-----
DecoReturns: Looks neat, reminds me I should give it a try.
-----
Tizoc: I hope this game will take the time to learn how to make eggs.

ThatsMyTrunks: Looks neat, but I'm not sure how much of a grasp of programming that is.
-----
SENPAIatLARGE: I'll keep my eye out.
-----
Joey Pockett: this looks dope

~!~"Get back to playing Smash Bros. Youkai" - My Hero, or Hero-wann

Hayama Akito: So I'm finally back to playing the game with a friend after a long time ago. It's an easy mode, you just have to beat the bosses. If you've beaten him before you don't need to do that. If you've not played the other bosses you can start with them as well. However, the first boss that comes to mind is the Link from Ocarina of Time. He's a very hard boss, but if you are stupid you can beat him.
I've played the entire OOT on the 3DS version.
And the original one on the Wii. I played this when I was pretty young. It's different, but normal.
-----
RochHoch: I think I don't even understand how "I've played the game before, so I understand it's in my head!" works.
-----
blondkayvon: I did not get to play this on Wii. I think I had to buy it on Wii U. I think I was 12 when I played it.
-----
isual: couldn't beat the other seven (duh) bosses in the first zone
-----
Rygar 8Bit: I played the game before I was 21 so it counts.
-----
brokeastronaut: I played it before I was 30 and I couldn't beat it. So basically my first mistake.
-----
Mike Rambo: I beat Link before I was 22, so yeah, I’m not too young for this
-----
Bakercat: I beat Link in the first dungeon first and then never again. I looked up how to beat him though.
-----
RecRoulette: When I was younger, I found this guy in Detective Pikachu and thought "How long before he appeared again?"
And then I saw him in the Detective Pikachu movie when I was 17, and thought "How many years before he appeared again?"

theofficefan99: I think the music from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild would win a few awards but I think it is kinda hard to pick. 
I think it would be cheating since BotW is the first game in the series to use the intro. 
Honorable mention is Zelda: Twilight Princess.
-----
yuoke: Maybe

Mauricio_Magus: Chrono Trigger
I like the music in this game a lot too.

~!~What's Your Favorite Fighting Game Theme?

SuperiorTrashTalk: I've been really into fighting games for a while and I've always been in love with the music in them. However, I just think I've played more of the ones I mentioned in the past and this one is the one that jumps right in with the zeitgeist for me.
The One I played the most is Street Fighter IV. It kind of reminds me of this but it's kind of jazz influenced. The intro to the opening of the game just gets exciting and epic. The game is so weird but I feel like it's a lot of fun. The music is really hype too. I think it's one of Capcom's best in recent years as I really love their fighting games and this song is my number 1 favorite.
What's your favorite one?
-----
Omar310: I've always wanted to play the game to get to know the story so let's say I have a fighting game theme. I know it's X game related but this song is really hype.
-----
Starlatine: I keep hearing the Streets of Rage theme constantly in fighting games, its so good.
I also hear the Streets of Rage theme from the original madmen
and the OG Street Fighter theme...I just prefer it to this shit.
-----
Spinky: I actually have a playlist (edit: apparently it's only uploads, I don't remember if there's a playlist). So I don't remember a single song, but I like the music a lot.
-----
Krejlooc: Yeah, I know the guy, but the actual song is pretty great. I'll probably just post the Youtube link, as I didn't want to be too pedantic.
-----
Seven Force: I don't even remember the game, but the Street Fighter theme reminded me of the classic Super Smash Bros. theme.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I don't even remember the game but the Street Rage theme is pretty great.
-----
Raticus79: I'm in the same situation. I have no idea if I'll like the game, but I've heard the Street Rage theme so much it makes me want to try it.
-----
Dreamboum: It's truly a masterpiece. I still get the feeling that all the future games will be like it when the song gets released, but

~!~What are some good mobile game recommendations to start with?

More_Badass: I’ve been trying to make a list of the best mobile games that are well-liked on mobile platforms, but that I’ve been unable to find anything that would actually be enjoyable for me.
I’ve finally settled on a list that looks at least decent (it excludes third-party apps like payPokemon) and doesn’t take things to completely new. I have no idea what this list is about, but it’s pretty broad. I don’t have a smartphone, but there are a few titles that I’d like to try first on the Switch, such as Pocket Rumble on iOS, a game that’s actually fairly easy to play on mobile, and a game I played on PC a long time ago.
I’ve included games that are mobile-specific such as Rune Factory 4, Clash Royale, Paladins, Clash Royale, Roblox, Enter the Gungeon, Undertale, and Enter the Gungeon II.
The list is essentially just a bunch of games that are good, but not perfect, and I have no idea what the point of this is. All I know is that I can’t pick a good mobile game that isn’t made by mobile developers, and I have no interest in playing games that don’t run on mobile. So I was wondering if there was any good recommendations for this list that aren’t clearly marked. I’ve tried looking at the announcements and asking people either in the hangouts or the Discord. If anyone has made an official recommendation, please mention it.
Also, I have played some of the Atelier games, and they seem to be good too.

~!~The Story of the Legend of Zelda

Phantom Thief: (Warning, lots of images in this post contains spoilers for the story of the Legend of Zelda series)
I've been coming back recently, after leaving the hobby for a decade, to rekindle my interest in the franchise. To that end, I came back to the story of the Legend of Zelda. I've always had a curiosity in describing it, and I wanted to make the effort to make this thread.
The Legend of Zelda (and Majora's Mask) has always been a strong subject for debate, with its successive entries being an exercise in subjectification. But the strength of the series' identity lies not in its centrality to a very core audience, as it is rooted into a very specific culture, and it is, more than any other media, the product of a rare defocalization of the Zelda fanbase's imagination.
The first game in which I started learning about the Zelda series, was the first video game I ever experienced. I passed the time and was dropped into a world that seemed vast and mysterious, and I was eager to explore all these eldritch worlds that seemed somagical. I was curious as to what kind of deities Zelda belonged in this world, and how, if she was the hero of the first game, or was it the first hero of the second, I might belong, but I didn't know her.
The first time I played Majora's Mask, I didn't know whether to call myself a swordsman or a witch, but I thought I had a point, after all, and so I went with a warrior, thinking I was the first to know my condition, and I fought with a sword, thinking I was the first to wield it, and I was the first to post this description in the game.
The first time I saw the Phantom version of the Divine Beasts in-game, and its description was very interesting, I thought it looked great, and I liked how it seemed to have a pretty distinct sword design, and I thought it was a really cute weapon. I just had no idea at first that I was playing as a swordsman, but I was still curious to try the divine beasts. I was expecting something like, "A summoner killed a lot of people," and I was pleasantly surprised that I was playing as a summoner.
One of the newer divine beasts, named Mensis, is so unique

~!~Why don't more games have FP??

JaeCryo: A quick google search tells me that many games don't have it. Is this a limitation for developers or just for the architecture? Or is it a feature that's already in many games?
I can't figure out whether this is a limitation for everyone, or just in the industry.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think most devs don’t think about it enough for the right reasons. 
Probably a lot of devs don’t think twice about it when it’s introduced

~!~I just got a USB SSD

Super Rookie: Pretty drunk and wanted to take advantage of the PC Gaming Week. I don’t know what the best way to do this is, but I found an article that mentions how I can use the SSD to install games onto my PC. 
So I got the use case that it will be convenient to reinstall games that I’ve bought that I don’t care about installing. 
Well it’s not a lot by the numbers, but I just wanted to be sure.
I also found out that the OS is around 50% faster than a HDD. It’s a bit disappointing, but I’ll be curious to try it out.
So, are there any other good USB SSD solutions out there that actually preserve my games faster?
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I use a large, old Samsung EVO SSD. It's a little smaller and has a lot more space than a standard USB SSD. I'm not sure what that's like exactly, but it's probably something like 23' or 24'.
-----
shiftplusone: thanks for the tip
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I’m now curious to try it out.
-----
shiftplusone: ok! so I can install the games there, but will need the HDD
my previous USB 3 one won’t even recognize my USB 2.0 one
if I have the HDD on my PC but it's not supporting extended storage cap (10-20%?) I can still use the HDD on my new model
-----
shiftplusone: well im in a bad way
i only want to take off the games, but it's hard to play them in the cloud
-----
shiftplusone: well im in a bad way
i want to play them on the HDD, but not on my PC
I want to play them in a RAID like the other members said, but that doesn't sound that great, but it would be nice to have them both on the same HDD
only thing I want to do is update my drivers to support hdd support, because I got my info wrong, I'm on 7.1
-----
shiftplusone: well im in a bad way
it's not that hard to update drivers but yea, I have to download the hdd and re-download

Shiggy: Ooooh. I was already sold on Darksiders 2. I still have no idea what actually constitutes a good action game.
-----
Darksiders: The Warmastered Edition is coming out on January 17
-----
Darkis-San: I've pre-ordered this...it's been on my radar for awhile now.
-----
Mifec: It's been on my radar for a long time. I guess I'll finally get it.
-----
Shiggy: I think you're just going to Harvest Peaks to see it.
-----
Darkis-San: It's been on my radar for a long time. I just finished the story and it was a fantastic story.
-----
brokeastronaut: My stuff is starting to come together. I got this for Christmas when I started playing the Warmastered edition on PS4 and I'm just having a blast with it. I don't know if it's just me, but it's hard to find games like this on PS4. Is there a game similar to these on other platforms? I feel like I'm playing a different game than I remember playing to this day.

~!~Help with PSN name change

KrigareN-: I'm new to PSN, I'm not sure what's the best way to do it, I just downloaded a PSVR title, it seems to work fine for me and I don't mind switching the name.
How do I tell if the account I'm doing PS+ is the one I want to the PSN account I used to play PS+ on?
What should I do?
-----
Mediking: "Your name is Priscilla and you've got to change your name to something better so that your trophies and saves disappear"
-----
OmegaSmash: The account you used to play PS+ on should be the one you used to play PS+ on.
I think changing your name is the easiest way out?
-----
kambaybolongo: Change your name is easy. 
You can change it to something better soon but it's best to have the PSN account you used to play PS+ on.
Some people are changing names before launch (most people I know I've seen are that).
-----
BlueBomberX: Change your name is very easy.
You can browse your profile on PS+ and change it to whatever you want. It's up to the person you want to connect to to make the change.
So far the process is straightforward and you can just find a user on PSN who will accept the user's name.
-----
Kabuki Waq: If you're using the PS+ account you used to play PS+ on can't change, you need to download a patch from the community so you can access that.
-----
BRSxIgnition: You can just change your name.
-----
pazinyo: No, you need to be on PS+ for the account you want to use PS+ for.
-----
Hexa: If you're using the PS+ account you used to play PS+ on, you need to create a new PSN account.
Edit:
Out of nowhere the PSN account I just made was suddenly added to PSN via a patch.
Yikes
-----
Kazoku_: You need to contact Sony Support and tell them about the download you just made.

~!~I love the Nintendo Switch but I’m not a big handheld gamer.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): So I bought a Switch last June, and I played through Breath of the Wild and Smash Ultimate and I never got to the full power of the Switch’s power. 
It’s been a long time since I’ve fully experienced the joycons for the Switch. I played through Mario Odyssey at one point but I’ve never felt like I could play through that again. I’m not sure what I’d play in the moment. I’ve been playing Mario Kart 8 almost non-stop for a couple weeks straight since Nintendo announced it and I just finished the Superstar Saga DLC. I just got past the Beartally Kingdom and coast to coast I am exhausted. The joycons feel great and I love how light and responsive they are. Just a small exaggeration? I dunno. When I'm playing a game I love the detachable dpad, it feels great, but I don't really get the same satisfaction when playing handheld. 
I don’t have a handheld mode. I feel like I’m too far behind other consoles in almost every aspect. All I really care about is the portability. I’ve played the Switch on and off for about 3 years now. I still haven’t played a multiplayer game on the Switch that good, and it’s not even close. I just don’t have the same amount of fun as I did when I was younger. 
The only reason I was a kid to play Mario games was because I was addicted to Nintendo’s handheld modes. The lack of joycons didn’t really elevate the experience for me. I just wanted to be able to put on my GameCube and Wii and just take it all in with me. 
I think I’m not a big fan of the idea of a handheld mode. I think it’s a step backwards compared to the big console structure of today.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don't think you get the full satisfaction of a handheld mode.
-----
Katsubento: Nintendo handhelds are fun but the lack of joycons is a bigger hang up than the lack of a true dpad.

Piscus: Nah,

~!~The Verge - The Video Game Industry Is The Worst Company On This Planet

Hobbes: This article originally appeared in the March issue of the journal but has since been moved to the full article →
There's so much more at the link but I've just come across this article and am having a terrible feeling about it. 
Sure, I'm glad the industry is getting better and better at this, but we are already in a time where studios are starting to lose their minds and stuff like this is starting to really worry me.
-----
Weiss: After seeing how badly Sony has managed to fuck people up like that Nightmare Souls, I see a market gone bonkers.
-----
Hobbes: I've seen a lot of the arguments made for and against the industry. But I don't think it's so bad when a lot of seemingly innocuous incidents surface in the wake of increasingly nasty examples.
-----
Miniature Kai: I've never been personally affected by this industry but it's certainly not the kind of thing that would make me go "Yeah, I'm not going there".
-----
Hobbes: As a side note, this is a post I originally made a thread about. 
I originally viewed it as a negative expression. Now though, I respect it and understand this sentiment.
-----
Hobbes: Ah I see. I'll add that it's a side note to avoid offense to fellow Resetera. 
Nice work!
-----
Cess007: I'm actually pretty glad this industry is still around! I respect the effort, the hard work, and the hard work put in by so many developers and publishers.
Microsoft is better at alot of things besides just their games, but I can't say I'm a fan of the "hardcore gamer" opinions (tbf, I'm one too many people who are gamers, people have opinions about them, it's just personal taste, not company culture)

~!~What game (pronounced boo-hay-bah) has your favorite rendition of a bossfight.

SolVanderlyn: First things first: I'm talking about the original Valkyria Chronicles. The music is so good.
I've been sneaking around in the streets of Bamco Park trying to find some secret boss fights that use music, and the music absolutely demolishes any boss I might be facing. I remember hearing the boss fight theme multiple times a day for months, and it still has stuck with me for years.
What's yours?
-----

Virtua King: Chrono Trigger.
I hate it's ugly, but it's the way the game sums up the game's essence.
-----
deimosmasque: Devil May Cry 3
-----
Manu: The entire game has a version of The Boss theme that plays when you fight Kaitos from the first DMC.
-----
Gundam: Final Fantasy 6.
-----

Unknownlight: FFX's version is great.
-----
KraytarJ: Street Fighter 3
