~!~For me, 2019 looks like a Bloodborne sequel

Elysiums: It's hard to look behind every corner when I see Nintendo products, but for me, 2019 looks like a Bloodborne 2. I really want to play through Bloodborne and I can't wait to get to the DLCs (maybe I'll start with the first). I'm not looking forward to the DLCs.
-----
DarkChronic: I don't get it. It feels so... shallow? I keep meaning to get back into it but I just feel that I'll never finish it. I'm not even a Bloodborne fan at all. Everything feels so cheap.
-----
Geth: For me, 2019 looks like a sequel to Bloodborne.
-----
Kamiyouni: ... Unless it's on the Switch.
-----
aGuyInaBearSuit: I mean Bloodborne was my first though.
-----
OricWindstar: No, it's still a sequel to Bloodborne.
-----
Kadin: Yes, I don't get it. I'm playing through it.
-----
Flux: I'm playing through it. The DLCs are great.
-----
DarkStingy: 2019, it's still an DLC.
-----
NKnight7: I don't get it either.

~!~What’s the best turn-based combat system?

ScOULaris: I love turn-based strategy and I’ve always been intrigued by turn-based games. For the sake of brevity I’d like to use a more classic “stronger” system than I have (Tactics 
====================
~!~I was just playing God of War yesterday and I was thinking about how good and emotional The Last Of Us Part II is

Toriko: So the game launched a few days ago in my favorite of times, and I just got back to playing it. I enjoyed it a lot for the first time in my gaming career and felt that it was a masterpiece and the pinnacle of cinematic storytelling.
The story in the game is fantastic and utterly remarkable.
The way the camera angles shift inversion is one of the best in any game for me. It creates an immersive feeling and yet simultaneously emotional and haunting.
The way the camera angles work initionally rotate around you while levitating is brilliant. It is very cinematic and so on. Inversion makes the whole 'teleporting around' mechanic as subtle as it can be. It is subtle in its use of wind currents/wind fields, solar flares and the like.
The jumping and climbing and the way you can freely throw things and the way you are levitate around is soo satisfying.
The camera angles are great and I am already very excited for the sequel.
The way the camera angles work is brilliant and again, soo satisfying.
The way levitation works and it works well.
The way levitation works so well and the way levitation works so naturally, is great.
The way levitation works so naturally and efficiently, is great.
The way levitation works and it works so smoothly, is great.
The way levitation works and it works smoothly, is great.
The way levitation works and it works smoothly and efficiently, is great.
And this is where to start the discussion.
-----
scottbeowulf: It's a masterpiece. I played it at least once the past couple of days and really liked it. It's a shame that it's not more talked about. I'm excited to play it again in the near future when hype dies down.
-----
vestan: It's a masterpiece.
-----
Much: It's a masterpiece. One of the best games of this generation.
-----
Toriko: I agree wholeheartedly. The levitation is an extremely creative mechanic that combined with the physics of the enemies to create an incredible levitation game that was honestly some of the most fun I have ever had in videogames.
-----
SweetVermouth: It's a masterpiece.
It's also

Lite_Agent: Just announced at the Nintendo Direct.
Players can now earn 20 online points with the online shop.
Confirmed for Q2.
It's still unknown when it will launch, but due to the nature of the online shop, it's likely that it will appear on the same time as the other versions.

~!~On the fence about buying an Xbox One X

Drewton: I've been thinking about buying an Xbox One X lately. I hear its great it seems, but I'm not sure I want to spend $500 or so on a console that's not up to my grasp and I don't see the need to spend $500 for online features and stuff.
I have a PS4 Pro and a Switch so I know they're pretty good but I also hear the idea of playing on that thing is a given.
I hear the S and X are good, but I don't know if I'll take $400+ for something else.
Is there any other reason I should get one?
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: I'm not the biggest fan of the One X. I actually think that it's a little better, in fact, than the Game Pass games that I've tried. I think that it does have a little input lag, but as far as efficient as the streaming-only service is I don't see how it's really worth the extra money.
-----
Renna Hazel: The One X is a low-end PC. It's not going to be powerful enough for the big budget games that would benefit from an X.
-----
Drewton: It's not even close. The Xbox One X can do something else, but it's not even close.
-----
bsigg: I thought the One S was an upgrade for the Pro and X. I haven't used the One S yet but I heard it is just better.
-----
bsigg: I heard that the One X is just better in terms of raw m.p. resolution and x detail. It's just a little bit better in games like FIFA.
-----
Drewton: Oh okay. I'll wait for a DF analysis.
-----
Drewton: I am playing on a One X. I like it.
-----
Gryflet: I think its a great console but its not a powerful console
-----
Drencrom: Yeah, its a very powerful console. I have a One X which is better at playing demanding games. Pro is fine for indies and open beta stuff.

~!~The Evil Within 2: Best Way To Play?

Encephalon: I've been trying to decide between the second and third game in the series, and I'm not sure which one to go with. After all, I don't think I've ever seen a game with a strong first run in a series before. And if I had to choose between that one and the third, I'd go with the first.
I'm not sure how long it will take to get to the end, but I'm currently between 4 and 6 expansions worth of play. I didn't keep up with the second game either, but I'm thinking I should be able to do it a little quicker.
I'm currently between 2 and 4 expansions. I've heard that I'm just fine with an easier time, so I'm not sure if I should go for the first.
I know it's not the same thing, but I'm a little afraid of going back to the first game. I feel like I'm in the minority. I was pretty anxious back in the day, but I guess I just changed my habits.
I'm going to be dividing the first game between expansions. I have the first one on PS4, and I have the second one on my PC. I haven't played the second game in ages, but I know it won't have those tank controls. The first game's tank controls are just bad. I'm thinking about playing it again, but I know it's a lot easier now.
I know the first game is more streamlined here. The map is bigger, you can travel to any point on the map, and you can just instantly jump over. I'm not sure if it's a more daunting addition here, or an addition to the typical survival game. But I just figured I'd try to get a few of the more common survival mechanics out of the base game. And I guess I'll just go in on Survival purely on that front.
For the record, I don't have a very good first time at playing the games. I was a huge coward in the first game and didn't know what the difference was between the first and second.

ckareset: I played them all and honestly they are better than the first one. I think the first one is way more polished but overall it’s not the same.

Encephalon: I did play the first three

~!~Greed: The Fall of House Dagda

Svart: Recently I decided to replay The House Dagda, a game that a lot of people remember well, and one of my first priorities. I love games with a sense of place, and Dagda is one of those games. But I think about it a little more, and it switches itself a lot. The sense of place is really there, and the sense of purpose is really there. The way society is corrupting people is there. The way the clan system is there. The way the game is, the sense of purpose is there. But the sense of purpose is gone.
In The Fall, Dagda is held in mind for millennia and centuries, not just for its Lovecraftian horror, but for it's haunting atmosphere. It's a game that evokes the spirit of war, cannibalism, slavery, questioning of moral values, rebellion, mass murder, political manipulation, slavery- communism, all this while The Fall calls you out on to defend your clan from murderous war machines. The Fall of House Dagda is an incredible game.
However, the game also calls to the past, and the Fall of House Dagda is a game that calls for dis-apers to have to work for their own benefit, and also calls out the darkness to guide them. You are one of the clans -- a clan of drangers. Dagda is a fantasy world made up of fantasy characters, mythologies, and language. And it's a world that has a lot of significance to it. Dagda is a world where a dark, magical entity called the Dark Plane has taken control, and it controls everyone.
The Fall of House Dagda is a game that calls for disapers to have to work for the needs of everyone in the clan. Dagda is a game where the clan has to get the Dis-aperon, or Dis-Acer, to stop the Dark planes from taking control of the Dis-Acer. The Dis-aperon have the responsibility to protect the clan, but they must be able to stop the Dark planes from taking control of the Dis-Acer. Their tasks are to stop the Dark planes from taking control of the Dis-Acer. Dagda is a game that calls for members of the clan to join the Uldrich

Kolx: The article is now posted and I'm seeing a lot of people saying it's a joke compared to the ACT.

Rei no Otaku: I hate Opencritic but this article is a joke. They specifically call the city the ''worst city''.

~!~Did Capcom’s exclusives do better on Switch?

Phantom Thief: Nintendo’s most recent releases for their most recent games are below the Xbox One.
Spoiler: Spoiler
On Switch, God of War, Monster Hunter, Fire Emblem, Monster Hunter Stories, Resident Evil, Resident Evil 7, Stardew Valley, Pokemon, and Super Mario Odyssey are of course now the top 3, with the occasional dip to reach the second tier. The recent God of War game is actually the best selling game in the series, right alongside Bayonetta 3. The Switch has always had exclusives on the Vita, but there’s been a notable drop in both sales and industry awareness due to the rise of mobile.
Capcom has also been aggressively trying to position themselves as a home for Nintendo franchises, both in terms of fighting games and platformers. They have pushed through with Smash Ultimate and Hyrule Warriors, alongside all the other games they have lined up to release. They have also been aggressively marketing Switch Online, encouraging those interested in playing their own exclusive games to check it out, and have added in a handful of Nintendo IPs, both add-ons, and credit editions.
So, which one of these two is doing better? Is it the Switch version of Resident Evil 7? Or does it seem like a more apt move to do the same for Street Fighter V?
-----
Zippro: Capcom is doing well because they keep doing things the right way. I suspect it's the Switch version because it is the best selling one, but I'm sure there are more factors at play that factor down the other two.
-----
foxuzamaki: I mean, they have both of them
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m not sure either is doing better but I have to give it props for doing something about bloat nowadays. I’m not sure Nintendo’s exclusives have ever made as much as this, even.
-----
Zalman: I agree, the only one in a long while that does well is Monster Hunter and that's a long time ago.
-----
TheBaldwin: I think its doing better than most for Street fighter, Pokemon and RE, but that doesnt mean much.
The other option is Capcom, but its doing better than pretty much any other dev this gen

Phantom Thief: I’m not seeing that from

~!~Do you think Sony will do the "Let's Go, Pikachu" dance again?

Phantom Thief: I think it's a safe step, and I think it's a topic that has been brought up. Sony has had a massive momentum in the West and Japan as both an entertainment company and a major territory, and I think they have a great momentum in the US, which is in turn larger than Nintendo. 
The Nintendo dance has always been controversial, and some people argue that the dance is dying, and the music for Sony has gone. But I think the controversy is over how to handle the dance, and that is why I am talking about the dance that will come in the PS Classic, and I will be talking about the music.
Sony has a very engaged in the PlayStation Classic, and they are planning a great E3 presentation, but the PlayStation Classic will be presented by Nintendo, and by how they handle it, Nintendo will be able to talk about it. Sony has started the process of opening up the PlayStation Classic, and the PlayStation Classic is already on their website.
Nintendo is also extremely excited about it, and will host their official PlayStation Twitter on their website, and the Classic will be on sale for $10 on all platforms.
So does this mean Sony will start the "Let's Go, Pikachu" dance again?
-----
Lant_War: No.
-----
SageShinigami: I mean, they've been doing it for decades. In fact, they might even be courting a developer if they actually want to do it.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think no.
-----
Knight613: Would be a weird move.
I think they will just do something else.
-----
Dime: Not really.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, I would prefer they just do the Classic and not redesign it, but I'm not opposed to that.
-----
Cartridge Games: There’s a thread on this already
-----
I Wanna Be The Guy: No. I don't have a smartphone so I'm not going to talk about it.

~!~RTTP - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt

matrix-cat: I've been playing GDT ever since christmas, and I'm actually loving it. I just recently started a new run over, and I finally decided to go back and finish it after having completed the first time. I still find this the most satisfying game to play, and I'm already in love with the world and how it feels to live up to the quality of the writing of the first two titles.
I have a massive backlog already, though, so I can't imagine I'm being too mad, but I have to admit I forget a few things and think of the story as a bad dream to attempt to achieve. I'm not really sure what the narrative is supposed to be about, but it's pretty clear to me that Geralt is the chosen one, and it's the one that's meant to tell Geralt what he is going to do best, and in the end it just comes down to how compelling it is to have the player's manhood wrapped up in the story.
I'm not really interested in the lore or the Witcher world itself. I do like that I can go back and rewatch some old cutscenes to get a better idea of things, though. 
I'm not really interested in any subpar sidequests, and I'm not really interested in Witcher humor. I like the game balance of the two, and I've loved every bit of LTTPs I've played of the game - by virtue of my love of it, and the witcher games that I've played.
Anyone else feel like this?
-----
Barry Hutthole: I think the story and quests in general are what really sells it. It’s part of the appeal for me. 
The combat is fun, but the writing is a bit rough and repetitive. I prefer the open areas of AC games. I’m not sure what goes in the main story, but I can’t really remember more than “just do the main missions”. I think it was The Witcher 2 and it was great. 
The main missions though are good. They make you care about side quests, etc. It was good during the main quest, but in the end it’s just padded and just made me forget things.

~!~Do you think Nintendo's next Switch Online will have a permanent price drop to $60?

delete12345: Yes, Nintendo Switch Online will have a permanent price drop to $60.
The price of the service will increase accordingly.
However, as we know, the price of the service will increase to $40.
So now, do you think Nintendo will price drop to $40 for the Switch Online?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It'll stay $20.99 or lower
-----
delete12345: It's up to each country and each Nintendo Switch revision, but (again) Switch online service is not officially called Nintendo Online. That being said, I think it'll be up to each country.
-----
delete12345: (I'm just confused, are you just confused into the confusion?)
-----
Jahranimo: Nope, it's up to each country. But the price is the same.
-----
blackthorn: I think it’ll keep it at that price.
-----
Mediking: It'll stay that way. For every price drop, I think it'll be $20.99.
-----
delete12345: I guess that makes sense since the service is not officially called Nintendo Online.
-----
Jaded Alyx: It's going to stay that way.
-----
Cartridge Games: It’s up to each country. 
It’s up to each country for the price.

I have a PS4 pro which could be turned into a PS5 (or even a Maybug if the rumors are to be true) pro ready gaming system. 
Any advice?
-----
Carn: You chose to play as a young boy.
The story is pretty self-explanatory, but it's not like the story in NGH is the first game. The only story is the one that was basically told through the character.
-----
NinjaScooter: Maybe do a quick 30 minute tutorial playthrough? It’s not like the game is the first time you play.
-----
Kenzodielocke: The first game is a nice taste of what the series is capable of.
-----
Flux: You can skip the first one and play it for the first time. The story is actually pretty self-explanatory.
-----
Jakisthe: I'd read the whole thing and thought it was a bit of a spoiler.
-----
Zephyriel: The first game is an amazing experience. Very challenging, but fun. The character has a lot of personality and I think he's the most interesting character to play as. I think all of the character's designs are great.
-----
SilverX: Yes, it is really good
If you can finish the story to the gameplay and quest structure you’ll be fine.
-----
Gnorman: You can play it on a psp/pc. The story and quests are great.
-----
Gnorman: Is the story a self-contained quest or is it part of the quest?

~!~Is it really a crime to play video games in the West?

delete12345: I'm talking about if you are playing video games in the West, or if you are playing video games in the West.
If you are playing video games in the West, or are living in a country where many people play video games, as long as you are playing video games, there is no difference in your chances of getting a positive outcome, or at least that is what I thought.
In other words, I was wondering, is it really a crime to play video games in the West?
I'm not talking about a person being a video game console in the West, but every country that has video games has citizens that plays video games.
It seems a crime to play video games in the West?
If I were to say in countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Korea, is this considered as a positive thing?
Since some countries like Japan, South Korea and so forth have very negative (to use an example) negative attitudes towards video games in their societies, I wanted to know how this is for you countries?
-----
Cartridge Games: In Japan crime is often done. 
I think in most of the world there’s a fairly progressive and consumer friendly side. Korea and Taiwan are pretty much dead set on free markets. 
I’ve always felt bad for those that sell games in Japan or the United States because it's super easy to easily find a good deal.
-----
InquisitorAles: I think it's a terrible crime, because people are stupidly cheap and lazy, it's not like they are being held to serve.
-----
Yaboosh: If you are a gamer and you buy a game for the sake of playing, do you really get negative outcomes? If you buy a game to play and a game to play you definitely do get a negative outcome.
-----
delete12345: Yes, that's what I'm asking.
-----
zombiejames: In South Korea, the criminal code tries to prevent any discussion of video games related to LGBT issues, though they have a variety of policies in place. It's not a very lenient thing, but it can result in people not facing any consequences, either positive or negative.

I've looked up some footage of Starlink from last year and it looks like it's a lot of fun! What's a good re-selling strategy for Starlink?

skeezx: i've had a bit of a falling out with the game in the last few months but i really think i should still begrudge them the money they've gone out of it with the last couple of patches. if they can get it under control they can just put it on the store

LewieP: It's worth about £15, even without the patches.

skeezx: imo they're worth it, for what it's worth
if not they should just sell it on the eShop for a pittance

Rebel1: The most expensive Starlink game ever
-----
Shane M: I mean, it's not like they're charging an extra for playing it. They've patched in a lot of QoL changes, they're not going to dip even one bit into MTX.
-----
Fiery Phoenix: I think they should be selling it if it's worth £15.
-----
skeezx: yeah i meant a fuck yeah
i mean if they should be paying the usual dev fees they deserve a good amount of criticism, they should be commended for the quality of the updates, they should be paying them to support the game, not charging to support the game is stealing some dev's money.

~!~Least content/things to spend money on in 2018?

Thewonandonly: So I’ve been thinking about this and it’s bothering me. I always hear about the microtransaction items, how bad they are and how boring the games are. 
Sure there’s tons of games that just have zero options or no way out except for the most minimal restrictions like no bugs or no cut content and few amount of side content but I’m starting to wonder if there’s some hidden or unlikable things you should spend money on in 2018.
Mine is the Switch. The only thing I’m spending money on in 2018 is the port of Odyssey. It and the rest of my Switch purchases are basically the same as the year before. The port was great, the music was awesome, the presentation was also fantastic and I’m sure all the other games will be similar. The ability to see the world have certain areas with a variety of locations that are sequenced to fit the collectible. 
Then there’s the other games I’m going to be playing that have had a ton of pointless side activities that I’m sure the rest will also be skipping. 
Is it just me? Or is there any truth to this fear? Is it time to cut back on gaming?
-----
Phantom Thief: There are many games where it’s not even a question, it’s just a complaint.
-----
DontHateTheBacon: I mean, if you don’t like a game, you aren’t going to go out of your own way to do something wrong. It’s not going to cost you a dollar to unlock something.
-----
Mega Man Zero: I've been playing Hollow Knight lately and it's awesome. I really like the game, but it's too full of shit to do what I want.
-----
NKnight7: I was going to say Hollow Knight, but it's the first time I've ever finished one.
-----
Thewonandonly: I’m a bit LTTP but I’m not a PC gamer so I haven’t played a Switch game in months and I wanna play more then I’ll ever do for a living lol. 
I guess I should just jump in with Hollow Knight and

~!~How will you replay The Evil Within 2?

TheBeardedOne: Personally, I've never played a survival horror game before, but this one in particular I'm really enjoying. I think it's a really well-made game. It's not mind-blowing, but a lot of the puzzles are really well-designed and didn't require a lot of thinking. I've only just started, though, so I'm still having a lot of trouble with it.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I know! I just haven't played one in my life, and I know that I've played a lot of horror in my life, so I know how. I just don't know when.
I just want to see how this one plays.

====================
~!~Will the PS5 be backwards compatible with the PS4?

PenultimateFantasy: I can only buy games digitally from PSN and I'm thinking of walking in with a PS4 controller and playing some games in a bit more intuitive / clean form on the PS4, but I'm not sure if it'll offer the options I'm looking for or not
I can see it being a bit backwards compatible at first, but then I read some of the games are not exactly the same as the PS4 versions
I'm thinking that it would be a bit weird to have to buy something on the same store as the cheapest and finished version of a PS4 game, not even a digital copy
-----
PlayALLTheGames: I think it will be, at least to me. It might be a bit unwieldy, but it will be a lot of fun.
-----
Xenex: Yes!
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I think it will. I think it'll be free to play on the same store as a game with that name
-----
Anthony Hopkins: Yes, it will.
-----
Expy: I have the same feeling. 
That's what I feel is happening.
-----
Maxina: It's not backwards compatible. That doesn't mean it won't. If it is, it's going to be a lot of dumb decisions that won't make sense in practice.
-----
Loudninja: I think it will be.
-----
sambills: im out
-----
kennyamr: It's not backwards compatible, but I will buy it for the PS5.
I think the idea of having to pay for a PS5 is at least a good idea. 
I'm gonna be one of those jerks if it ever goes gold.

Mitsurugi: Well that’s unexpected

====================
~!~The PS5 is a question mark. Will you buy it in its current form or is it done forever?

melodiousmowl: There's a lot of potential here, but for me, I would rather a return to the PS2 era. I miss my PS2 days.
I have a PS4 Pro still kicking (I upgraded to a Pro), and it's hard to be excited about the PS5 with the implication that it'll be a "killer" of sorts, or that I'll be able to "upgrade" to a PS5.
-----
Savantcore: I don't think I'll ever buy one without a big fat backwards installation - I just get an install disc with a disc file.
-----
Flux: I don't like the idea of a PS5. I don't know how it'll even function without a disc drive.
-----
Megatron: Yeah, for me it's a rollercoaster of expectations, hope, dreams and expectations come true and then some.
-----
Kyoufu: I liked getting my PS3 back every few years, I had my PS2 slim and PS4 back when they were super cheap, I had my fat PS3 back in 2015 and got my PS4 slim (which had a nice Slim, but it was a expensive day) and now I'm waiting until the PS5 releases.
-----
Shpeshal Ed: I have a Pro.
-----
Derrick01: If I could just get my PS4 and a PS5, and it was a slim PS4 on PS4 I'd be happy with that.
-----
Kyoufu: Yeah, I got my PS3 slim and it was really great. My main concern was the BC was just like every other piece of hardware in my house and I didn't mind.
-----
melodiousmowl: I miss my PS3, I know I'll be glad to pay the extra for it.
-----
KojiKnight: They're both still working fine. I'm just hoping the next PS5 is backwards compatible, or at least that's what I hope is the case.

Shahadan: Zelda, Super Mario World, and Breath of the Wild

mavericktopgun: Oh yeah yeah, I'm also going to buy Mario Tennis Aces.

Jaded Alyx: I believe tropical freeze and the ability to play with friends online make it the best one.

JazzmanZ: Mario kart 8 deluxe

Tied up with Smash Bros for the best part.

====================
~!~Far Cry 5's Mr. X is one of the best weapons in the series

Memento: Why the hell is it best in the franchise?
I mean, it is not even a contest. It is one of the best weapons in the series. The Zapper and the Waxy Glaive are both excellent, if slightly lacking in ctf. But the real MVP weapon in the series is the Shotgun.
And the reason for that is because of thier ability to morph into other weapons. Mr. X can turn into a lot of different stuff. He can turn into a fucking minigun. But he can also turn into a fucking Zapper!
-----
ara: He's definitely not the best weapon in the series, but I've seen some people say that he's there in the Sons of Sparda games.
-----
Gestault: I like that, but I think he's the best. The Shotgun has a special sauce sauce sauce, but it's a really fun mechanic to add to an already fantastic setup. He's been used as a disparate weapon ever since the first (and only genuinely functional) trailer. I really like the Shotgun in Far Cry 3, though, and the ability to transform into other weapons in the game makes it so wonderful.
-----
badcrumble: He's definitely a cool-ass weapon, and the ability to transform into other weapons is great. It feels like a little pseudo- post-apocalypse "hey, so you know what, in this game you can go to any time, and suddenly transform into different stuff"?
I dunno. I mean, it's a weapon that's awesome, but there's just no way in hell I'd feel "cinematic throwing away" if I were to suddenly have the opportunity to play with it.
-----
Gevurztraminer: Yeah, I agree that it's better than the pump and DCK, but the ability to transform into other weapons in the game is cool. I like the Waxy Glaive more though.
-----
Memento: I think you can cast spells in the game?
-----
Maneil99: I disagree. He is the best weapon in the series.
-----
Memento: I have a wishlist with the new weapons and a video showcasing the new abilities. I would have loved to see one of these in the game.

Soulflarz: I dunno how true this is tbh

WonderLuigi: It's possible.

====================
~!~Are there other examples of game mechanics that are "fun" but don't outright destroy the game itself?

delete12345: I'm not interested in opening threads, but I wanted to use this thread to discuss this topic. 
I originally opened this thread thinking that combat-focused games with constant combat-driven games (DF games) would be more fun. But, the thought that you can't improve the combat itself, destroys my mind. So, I'm going to delve into the trash and try to clean up the thread for the examples I can find.
I'll start with a game called "The Last Blade", and I think it's pretty amazing.
This is a game where you're charged by Blade and Soul to use devastating abilities on multiple enemies to kill one target.
And the game is not that fun.
What other examples of game mechanics that are more or less broken by the difficulty or challenge of their respective games?
-----
vestan: The Witcher 3 was pretty fun but the combat arenas were a bit too big for the game and the game doesn't really challenge you enough to get better by brute forcing you with those fuckers.
-----
MidnightCowboy: Ive had more fun with Horizon ZD than any Souls game, however the combat arenas can be a bit too slow for the game and the overall package is weaker than DS2. Not sure about the balance but I enjoyed the combat in 1 more than I did in the other Souls games.
-----
Deleted member 300: Yakuza games?
-----
kvetcha: The Fatigue system in Persona 6.
By the end of the game, everything felt so satisfying that I actually didn't want to use it.
-----
Tibarn: The Last Story is an excellent example of a From Software game, where you can choose to focus on one side or on the otherside with increasing difficulty. It's one of the reasons why the game is so engaging.
-----
Svart: The Witcher 1 had a difficulty curve on the right side, but it was not as extreme as the Witcher 2 or AC:Origins.
I like to compare the two, though, because Ubisoft's first couple of Ubisoft titles (particularly Origins) were very hard to beat. Odyssey is just absurdly easy, and I beat it on Hard, but not on Normal or Hard.
-----
Svart: Yeah,
====================
~!~The Nintendo Switch Is The Best Console of 2018!

Bobo Dakes: Tons of great games and complete worlds, and I thought I'd give the Smash Brothers game a try. I'm playing the original NES versions, but I'm getting a bit of a thirst for the online mode. I was gonna get Fire Emblem Heroes, but then it just started getting decent content updates.
-----
Raijinto: I think most people agree on that. I've been a Nintendo Switch subscriber for a very long time, ever since I first got my Nintendo System in 2011. My current obsession is in Metroidvanias and Mario games. Plus a good chunk of my original Switch library is from my brother who lives across the country.
-----
Bobo Dakes: I did like to mention that I have an amazing relationship with my brother. We have a huge shared love of Nintendo consoles and Zelda. What's left for us to take back? Is selling the Switch to a third party an option? Is building a family a way to get us through a difficult time?
-----
Tizoc: The luigi foxes were great as well
-----
Mediking: Awesome! I love this generation. Hands down.
-----
FairyEmpire: Yeah, I've been feeling that lately, especially with Smash and Pokemon. I'm suddenly loving it. And to a lesser extent, I'm having a hard time picking a side.
I've been holding out for the Switch to be like the PS4 in regards to price, features and ease of access, but it's in a spot now. I'm not even sure it's the sole reason for the ongoing dominance.
-----
Khanimus: This is like the mid 90s PS4 vs PC argument.
-----
VXLnoise: I mean, it’s not.
Nintendo’s insanely popular stuff is still kinda new?
-----
FairyEmpire: I mean even the best of the best. It's still the biggest console of the lot. I can see why they're holding back stuff, but their most excellent stuff is still released on top.

JaseC: (Click for general game info.)
System requirements:
Latest drivers: (as at 02/04/2019)
Nvidia: 425.11 Hotfix
AMD: 19.4.1
Intel: Depends on your processor; download the driver update utility
Benchmarks:
Overclock3D (English; launch build)
TechPowerUp (English; launch build)
Tips and tricks:
Cap the frame rate/potentially improve frame times (1): Download RivaTuner Statistics Server, input your desired framerate limit in the "Framerate limit" box, and hit enter (the program comes bundled with MSI Afterburner and earlier versions of EVGA PrecisionX). Alternatively, those with an Nvidia GPU have the option of Nvidia Inspector, which can also be used to impose a framerate cap, either in a similar manner to RTSS or by way of forcing a different vsync interval (click the small tool icon to open the game profile section).
Note: Useful if you your system can't maintain, say, 60fps and you're sensitive to the wild fluctuations, or you're experiencing uneven frametimes. The greater window the engine has to render a given frame, if you're imposing a lower framerate than the game can otherwise provide, may also help in alleviating stuttering related to data streaming.
Potentially improve frame times (2): Use exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless fullscreen. (Credit to Knurek.)
Stop the game from crashing after 15 minutes on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: Open the task manager, switch to the Services tab and disable TabletInputService.
Put some context behind those graphics settings values: Sine the number of CPU cores and the number of graphics cores and shader cores up. (Credit to Knurek.)

~!~What are your favorite "obscure" games?

delete12345: I think we can all agree that Super Mario Odyssey is the best "obscure" Mario game. In my opinion, Mario Uced it from pretty much the consensus of the Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Galaxy teams, to what I consider the definitive version of OOT, and which has been ported to pretty much every console ever.
And the music!
The soundtrack for Odyssey is outstanding. It's so fucking good.

~!~What’s your favorite hidden gem in the genre?

Mr. RPG: What’s your favorite hidden gem in the genre? 
I’m drawing a blank just now with the DQXI + Spidey sale. I’m not looking for hidden gems but the few that I have been able to get that I didn’t know about or have no background in (I have a Switch and a PS4 but do not have a PC to play these) are games I played and beat but never saw coming together. There are so many hidden gems I’ve found but I don’t talk about them because I have a lot of games I can’t play now.
-----
Mike Rambo: DQXI! 
I’m not a huge DQ guy myself but I really liked the demo and I thought it looked fun. Played it on my Vita and loved it! 
Cuphead!
-----
Kyoufu: I'm hoping that DQXI turns out well so I can buy/rent it.
-----
Al3x1s: DQXI is a lot more forgiving than DQX 1 and has the tighter level design and unique enemy design combined with the better level design, please don't get it at launch. It's the best in the DQ franchise but you can't go wrong with any other DQ games.
-----
carlosrox: It's my most played game of 2017. I've got it weekly and I just put more than 30 hours into it. I do wish that Nintendo would give it more of a chance because I don't think it's worth the price it would have taken to launch it.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I'm not a DQ guy, but I really enjoyed DQXI. I've put over 250 hours into it, yet to come close to completion.
-----
mikeys_legendary: I played it when it launched and I loved it. I had no idea that Spidey did this to those who've already played it. I bought it 5-6 times on PC and I still find myself enjoying it. It's fun, and the levels are great. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's already a fan of the series, but you can certainly grow a collection of those as you play

~!~Games with amazing atmosphere (Halo, Gears, Half-Life)

MasterCharon: With the release of Halo: Reach I wanted to talk about some games that had amazing atmospheres. Not just actual warm-ups but you get the sense of being in the midst of a battle. The first time you see a ship rising outta space and into the night is quite something.
I will start with one game that had a really great one. I am going to call it Halo: Reach.
On March 11th, 2002, Bungie was on fire and Halo was in the beginning of its terrible run as a MP focused title. The first mission would be launched within the hostile planet system, then the weapon neutral mission would kick in, and then the neutral mission would suddenly fire on all of the players, sometimes even to the point where they would stop playing for a few moments. At first they would give you weapons that would give you limited ammo, other players would have weapons that gave limited ammo and the game would become chaos.
Players would try to kill one another by camping or killing the team. Eventually all of the players had to cross a buffer gas gas deposit blocking players from ever being out of alignment. This allowed players to just camp and kill other players, and there would be no danger in ever getting past a defensive error. Players would have a componenace to this, and it was a componenace that required you to shoot the other player in order to shoot the gas.
This componenace was called the Hunk Hunt. It was a murderous sniper that would deal blows from mid range to long range, hitting unsuspecting enemies in the process of killing them.
The first mission would have players fight for survival, and there was an objective to reach the Hunk Hunt. Players had to kill the Hunk Hunt by tracking their health bar and then killing the player with a shotgun shell. The objective would become to break the lower body of the player to kill the Hunk Hunt hunter. Players would run around holding the shotgun shell moving forward, striking the lower body of the player who is trying to reach the lower body. This would allow the player to break the lower body of the player who was trying to reach the lower body by hitting the enemy with the shotgun shell. This would allow the enemy to break the lower body of such a player by hitting the right hunk hunting them with the shotgun shell.
This would be considered an excellent

~!~What's your favorite game that you have yet to play?

Cudpug: As in, haven't played it in years but in the past my friends and I have all gotten our first games to play and we all wanted to get to it together. We had a party the night and the first thing we played was a game of some kind and it was a TPS or whatever but when we went back to it after a night at sleep, it was just a crazy, nightmarish experience.
But whatever we played over the course of the night, always felt like we were playing a loving, fun game of fun. Which is the best thing ever.
So tell me, what's your favorite game you've yet to play? Got a PSP and haven't even finished it yet? Which one is the best?

~!~How long before you can buy the complete edition of a game

thebagel1: I had this thought for a while. Let's say I wake up in the morning and want to play a lot of Fortnite. I have Pokemon Gold and Silver, but I'm only able to play one of them for a couple of hours a day. I have other games like Zelda, but I rarely touch these. I have Smash bros Ultimate and Pokemon White 2, and never touch Gold and Silver. So, do these game's publishers expect publishers to take notes?
I really don't. I have God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2. I have Spiderman and have never touched either. I have MHW and don't touch it. I have God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2.
How long before I can buy the complete edition of a game? I have never bought any of them.

Omar310: Don't play games. Play what you want.

Terraforce: I mean, until you beat the one game you don't want to play right away, unless it's a one year exclusive one of those days.
-----
FluxWaveZ: The only time I'm willing to wait is for the game to be like a bloated experience, where it becomes an overwhelming chore to play.
-----
Strings: Not long.
-----
LavaBadger: I mean, you can play a short game for like an hour and then feel obligated to play it over and over again. That's your problem.

Opa-Pa: You have to play the one game you truly want to play, and that's Ni No Kuni II.

Okabe: Lol I thought it was a one year only offer and felt dumb as fuck

~!~Now your time to play video games

Master Chuuster: A.A.
You want to play video games, you probably already know that's what people do, but now you're here hoping people will stop telling you to play video games.
There are many types of video games, but this thread is for those video games that you really enjoy, but you just can't play them.
There are a lot of video games that you really like, but you just can't play them.
-----
Master Chuuster: That's a great point. But that's also why I said playing video games is not the same as playing a movie.
-----
KarateBusinessman: I can play them but not replay them, I play them for the story.
-----
Frecklestein: I didn't know you could actually play video games.
I don't even wanna know.
-----
SENPAIatLARGE: I've never played a video game. For those who are REALLY into it, the trailers, the announcements, the merch, I like it because it's a video game. 
Also, I played the original Fallout, and I loved it.
-----
Frecklestein: I knew that.
-----
ASaiyan: Play games no one else ever plays. Play games.
-----
Master Chuuster: I genuinely believe that!
-----
ASaiyan: I don't think that's the case at all. Most people don't even play video games, but I have friends who do and they can play and have fun with them.

~!~How's the next Assassin's Creed Odyssey?

Saint-18: With Odyssey out at the end of May I'm wondering how the game is going to be at the end of the year. I've only played the first 3 weeks of the game, and a lot of that has to do with staying up late and playing other stuff, but I think Odyssey is looking pretty good.
1 thing that's holding me back is that I'm not sure if I'm going to like the combat as much as Origins. I know that's a sore spot of all the modern open world games, but I'm not sure if that's the right kind of combat for Odyssey. I've always been really down to take out those enemies with arts and such, but I don't know if the combat is good in this game.
Also, is there a story to tell? I only played about a month or so back. I know the game's been out for a year, but I feel like playing a much different game than I did in Origins before. I just don't know if I'd enjoy any combat at all.
-----
Djost1kk: I think the main story is great and has a really good expac.
-----
Betty: Pretty solid. Valkyria Chronicles was disappointing but the rest of it is excellent.
-----
KrigareN-: I finished it last week and have loved every second of it.
-----
Zacmortar: You should never play the main quest, at least not more than the tutorial
-----
malaise: I agree. If you're expecting a more linear game with a few missions with some exploration and more combat, Odyssey feels like the most ideal game to play, and it's better than the other games in the series.
Combat is great, but I feel like the main story is the weakest part of the game and you could have a lot of fun exploring it if you enjoy the gameplay much more.
-----
Cybersai: It's the best AC yet so far.
-----
UsoEwin: The main story is bad, but the sidequests are great and the story is bonkers with some really good twists and turns.
-----
Hagi: I think it's the best game of the franchise next to Origins and TWT. However, The main story is not very good, the side characters are bad (they arent
====================
~!~What do you all think of the Nintendo Classic Mini?

Hero of Legend: UPDATE:
This is specifically about the NES Mini. I have the B, C and D (but not D in the middle lol) joycons as well as the SNES Classic.
The NES Mini is apparently the best value out there for a Classic console ever right now. If you had the NES Mini when did the GBA came out, do you think the NES Mini would have been more of your best value? I haven't seen any discussion anywhere about how the GBA itself would have fixed issues with the NES Mini, I just recall some people saying they actually fixed the problem with the NES Mini.
The problem with the NES Mini (and NES Mini Plus) is that the GBA version of it, the B, was such a good value when it came out. We've all been there. Some games were the best value, some had the best values, some even had the highest values ever.
The NES Mini itself came with two games: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages. They're Japanese 2d games but they're excellent on their own merits. The entire package is $40 USD.
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages I and II are currently being reviewed by the Nintendo ESRB. It's a great remake of the first 2 games in the Oracle games. I haven't played them yet, but I liked the first two games that I really liked. I think they're still worth playing if you really, really like the first two games.
The NES Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons is also great. It's heavily story focused with plot twists. It's remade by an anime outfit artist and the original music is done by the original orchestral soundtrack. It's a great package and it's very cheap to buy right now. There's no download option, but I believe there's a way to get the game with the NES Classic with the NES Online app.
The RE Chronicles series is also a lot of fun if you like the originals. It's a spinoff series from the original RE franchise that is kinda unique. It's a spinoff from the original RE franchise and has a decent story. It's also a great way to play the original RE series for the first time.
The C version of Super Mario RPG was pretty cheap in Japan, it
====================
~!~PSA: The Next Upers is a fake-out glitch, and it's already hurting you.

Sage: We had a thread on this not too long ago.
A guy decided to take his friend across the United States to a local skating meetup. His friend and the meetup's manager were in the room, but unable to play with them because it was a glitch.
The glitch was that the girl's friend couldn't be in position to watch the girl play. They entered the wrong skater line.
Once this happened the girl left and the guy left. The girl who asked to meet him, entered the other skater line and played with them.
This guy decided to get the girl across the street and you can take her into a car, where he starts driving with a stick and you can jump off the road while watching 2 kids doing blocks of ice.
Again, the girl who was seen at the meetup was in the wrong line and the guy who was driving was an AI. He didn't give you the direction of where the car is in the street, and the girl was dead.
There was a firmware update, but for some reason never released it because of this bug. They removed it because no one would buy it and it took them a long time to fix.
This guy really didn't like the game. They tried to make the game as realistic as humanly possible, but the AI messed with him and made him stand on a block of ice and beat me. He was fucking L I V A T.
He's done multiple cheats on the game, but this is the first time he's beaten someone, and I don't think he was ever going to be like this.
I think this is a real bug for the game and I don't understand why it's making it through these updates. Sony has the best online trophy system and one of the best online communities in the industry. I bet the trophy system is broken as well.
-----
Syril: I think it's just a glitch.
-----
Jucksalbe: The guy is just doing silly skater skates with you.

Maneil99: I think it’s a glitch.

~!~Halo 5: Guardians - what to expect

BAD: Please don’t get my weekend schedule because I’m not up to speed with this. 
Also not sure how I feel about the mic being permanently on the front of the suit. It reminds me of the MGS suits though.
-----
KoolAid: Well I mean, it's not the most important suit in the game. 
But did he also have to wear them?
-----
Spring-Loaded: Are you sure?
I think it's clear enough that the suits can be worn no matter what.
-----
BAD: Like... what’s that? It’s a helmet and it doesn’t prevent you from killing every enemy.
-----
Eggiem: Should be. And it should be.
-----
Frostman: I’m sure it’ll survive but if they’re not fitted with the metal hanger buckle and hanger neck bracelets then it’ll be useless.
-----
saenima: I'm sure it'll survive... but I expect it to get eaten by other creatures!
-----
BAD: It’ll be eaten, so you’ll lose all your components
-----
BAD: That is the least likely outcome, even moreso than the MGS suits.
-----
Bhonar: I mean, it's not the most important suit in the game. But it's not the most important suit in the game either.
I see Halo 5 on the line and I don't think Bungie cares that much about it at all.

~!~Best Devs for a Sporty Rhythm Game (Futuristic)

daxy: Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I think it's a really good rhythm game for racing games.
I was watching this video and it's pretty clear it's designed for intuitive speed-correction and navigation.
Here are some of my favorite tunes from the game:
Can't wait to play more of this type of game.
-----
Svart: Zelda.
-----
Joseki: The game has a score editor.
-----
Giolon: Isn’t it a Ubisoft game?
I know this is a ridiculous statement but I think it’s a good rhythm game.
-----
Oscillator: I don't think a real-time strategy game could really be as fast-paced/detergent as this.
-----
Crayon: I'd be down for that. I love that game.
-----
hvysky: I like the score editor. I was thinking of playing this a few months back and I made a wish on it. If I do end up with a few less options lol I'd definitely be in for a different score editor.

====================
~!~Do you think we'll ever see another Breath of the Wild?

JaeCryo: After Breath of the Wild, I was itching for adventure so I dove right in to the world to see what was waiting in the overworld. And holy shit, is there one place I've been waiting in for ever so long! I was so enraptured with what was waiting just 2-3 hours in the game, I was hooked!
I remember starting a playthrough of the first main quest on the island in the foothills of the mountains and completely immersed in the beautiful overworld, and immediately after I realized that there was a big, beautiful landmark that I had never seen. And it took forever! I knew I was going to be itching to go back and finish the main quest, but I was right...
So here's the question, do we see a game that makes you want to replay the entire game again just to experience it again?
-----
Funyarinpa: I think so, but what I remember most fondly was discovering the Champion's Ballad boss in the caves around the main town.
-----
Aigis: I remember playing the first DLC for rain of gold, on the second dungeon I went the tutorial dungeon doing the daily quest along side of the normal path, and finding a lot of amazing stuff to do, but just never got back into it
-----
Elven_Star: Not really. I think I made a big checklist of areas and got distracted by my needs. But I'm sure someone discovered something in Breath of the Wild.
-----

Mifec: I think so, I remember nearly every zone discovering a path that I was going to go for.
-----
Raijinto: Hmm I didn't really have any particular need for the game but I did need to replay it and beat the DLC to do that.
I've also got a list of game areas I plan on going back to (I still have the Path of Exile map but haven't completed it yet)
-----
Bakercat: I think so. The first time through, I just wanted a break from the main game.
-----
mrmickfran: The only game I ever wanted to replay was Mass Effect 2 back in 2008.
I still have my save on disc 2.
-----
Phantom Thief: Not at this point.

NeoRaider: I mean... it looks... but it's not shovelware.

====================
~!~The Quiet Man is the best game of E3 2018.

Toriko: The video isn't exactly new but this is the first time I've seen a game from this gen achieve scores this high. The game is a visual novel style VN along the lines of Hotel Dusk that is a must play and a must play for fans of visual novels.
If you like visual novels you will love this game.
-----
Regiruler: The sequel of the first game?
-----
FluxWaveZ: Definitely the sequel. The first game had a "best of" score/review of the year that came out at the very end of the scale.

~!~Why is it so hard to find Metroidvanias?

Phendrift: I’ve always been a bit of a Metroidvania purist, actually, but recently I’ve found out that there are some very good Metroidvania games on the eShop. Some I’ve been watching a lot of and enjoying myself, and others I haven’t, and I find them more methodical in their design, like Grim Fandango, but overall I can’t really pinpoint the reason.
I’ve tried looking for them on PSN and Steam, but I’ve mostly been turned off by the design and the style, so I’d rather just not play them? Is this a deliberate or unintentional restriction?
I dunno if I’m the only one, but I really like Ori and the Blind Forest, and I think the next one will be Samus Returns, too. Anyone else?
-----
Derachi: I know it’s “Absolutly gorgeous, nothing more”, but I really need to get around to playing Ori and Samus Returns.
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: Because they are all pretty good.
-----
Phantom Thief: You’re right, and I agree with this sentiment OP. I’d just not play them.
-----
Einbroch: Well, if you’re going to play them, play Samus Returns.
-----
texhnolyze: I feel like you get the point. They really are good games with very different gameplay.
I don't like the Metroidvania genre at all, but I still enjoy them as a genre.

====================
~!~What’s the worst RPG game of all time?

DeejayNose: I’m in the mood for a RPG right now and am about to go through Shadow of the Tomb Raider. I’m currently working through the “Completed” section right now and it’s hard to believe I’m approaching the final act with such utter abandon. This is the second time I’ve completed the section and it’s a damn slog to get through.
At the same time, I’m really enjoying my time with this game. I’m not even halfway through the game so far. I’m a bit concerned about how the game continues since I don’t even know what’s going to happen in the story. I’m going on Chapter 2 after having already completed that section, so I’m not even sure if I’ll just have to do this section or if I’m going to go in blind.
Overall, is there anything that I can use to call this a horrible game or a good one?
-----
Saint-14: I moved onto the side of my post.
-----
Mifec: Just generally dislike the game, hate the combat system and the writing.
-----
Admiral Woofington: There's a lot of valid criticism, but I generally don't actually agree with you. I thought the writing was excellent and the pacing was just incredible. The combat was very repetitive and repetitive.
-----
InRainbows: I don’t know what you’re looking for
-----
DeejayNose: If you think I'm the only one that really enjoys the combat in that game I honestly believe it. I love the combat in the game, and beating the bosses at the very end had me enthralled and I even loved some of the platforming.
-----
Kromeo: The writing is just bad, this thread reminded me of those Nier Automata endings and I agree
-----
MP!: I like Kingdom Hearts but Kingdom Hearts 3's combat is just bad.
-----
DeejayNose: Yep, I mean the ending of 3 is pretty great.

J_ToSaveTheDay: I'm not sure if I'd say it's a bad game, but I don't really agree with the

Jawmuncher: In Canada only. There's a new retail theme park just announced. Seems to be exclusive to Canada.
I'll add a link once I get home.

Dancrane212: Interesting! Might have to give this a go for it to well. The last time I checked Facebook Marketplace had a similar thing at the end of October (before all the pre-orders were out).

CaviarMeths: I've been meaning to check this one out. I've heard the theme park theme is great and better than the last one.

Jawmuncher: I just checked and there isn't a theme park yet.

But yeah, if it's just a theme park I'm in.
-----
CaviarMeths: It's a theme park. They've been selling theme park cards for the last month although they don't sell cards anymore.

Dancrane212: It's definitely one of those "do you want it" rides. The last time they put them on sale was during the Summer Sale.

Knight in Shining Armani: I know there's a PersonaQ 2 and 3D remake coming to the Switch, but are you interested in a new AAA AA game for the Switch or PS4 with less RPG elements?
-----
FluxWaveZ: I can see the Switch being a very big point of interest for the type of game we see here.
-----
sambills: I mean if they dont go out on switch, im all in this
-----
Mediking: We have a very small but dedicated group of dedicated gamers.
-----
Tailzo: I would be interested in a new RPG game to be honest.
-----
DarkDetective: I’d say PS4. More people need to play Persona Q2 and 3.
-----
OmegaDL50: The Switch is the ultimate testing grounds for any RPG's success.
Also, I'm not sure if I want a new Persona.
-----
Stygr: We have a small but dedicated gaming community there.
-----
Allyougame: I was interested in a game for the first time, but after playing the Souls thirst on last gen consoles and thinking it would be awesome, I gave up.
I am sure there is a gaming community in the Switch, so there are many potential fans who could get into the genre.

====================
~!~The Jimquisition - Red Dead Redemption 2: What can publishers do to appeal to more people?

Cincaid: I've been thinking about this quite a bit and I've got a few questions that I want to get answered.
I've got a long-running series that Jim has been raving about for years. The most infamous example is The Legend of Zelda. Basically, the next game has to appeal to more people that traditional RPGs don't. Of course, this can vary wildly, and it's not just a Nintendo thing. It's also important to remember that I'm talking about the current trends in videogame marketing - the rising standardization of click-bait, lack of consumer appeal, the need to actually innovate, etc.
Now, I'm not opposed to this. I think it's important to look back at the old days of advertising for games - ads from the early days of TV and radio - that used to air on pretty much everything. And I think that's a problem. It's not just a matter of "wow, this is clickable" but "I can't actually read well". There are much more effective ways to motivate gamers to click, and the new standard for advertising is the need to actually innovate.
I'm talking about this because companies like Ubisoft have spent the last decade trying to innovate their games with microtransactions. They have tried a host of things to try and appeal to gamers that already paid for their games, as well as other things to appeal to the younger generation. Some examples include the following
These are direct results of what he did at Bioware. They were the first to implement in-game rewards in their games
In addition to all of this, I'm talking about the last generation. It was basically when EA tried to appeal to the "casual" audience by making some games with randomized encounters and dungeons instead of the usual open world. This was thanks to randomized encounters and dungeons, which were baked into the gameplay of those games.
EA tried to appeal to both audiences as well, by making the game have randomized encounters and dungeons. They also introduced paid premium currency that was also in many of the games he worked on. Since those games didn't sell that great, EA was left holding the bag for years and years on end.
So, lets see what he has to say.
Do you agree that publishers need to innovate?
Do you think that publishers

~!~Could the DualShock 5 be a 2020 PS5 launch controller?

Memento: You might say oh look, the design is incredibly clean. The ergonomical buttons are just perfect. The grip buttons are just so much better.
I personally would prefer the PS4 controller, but it seems like the PS5 could use the same design.
-----
fantomena: No.
-----
CaviarMeths: It's weird, the DS5 has had some bad PR for it.
I doubt they're going to revisit the design though.

~!~I'm still confused about the state of the Xbox version of DOOM 2016

MasterOfPasties: I just beat it and I'm pretty sure it's still the best version of the game. I think it's 30fps at times, 30ish% slowdown and 60 fps. I've heard quite a few people say that 30fps is just not possible in DOOM..
What's the deal with that? Is it legitimately the best version of the game? Is there an actual flaw with the X version?
-----
GavinUK86: They're 30fps locked on PC.
-----
Theorry: 60fps is fine. It just feels weird to play on PC.
-----
m23: I've played it on PC. 30fps is never a real issue.
-----
Theorry: Tried it on PC, it runs at 60 fps on that. Took abit to long to get it to 60 fps.
-----

Theorry: Took abit to long to get the PC version.
-----
HockeyGuy412: Everytime i try it it says 100 percent
-----
Theorry: Tried it on PC, it says %100. But i said to others it was 99 percent because the game freezes around 100 percent.

GavinUK86: Not to mention COD and now BFV have higher frame rates. So does every other game within the last couple weeks.

~!~RUMOR: The Ultimate Collection of Retro PS4 Emulation (Dev)

Krejlooc: Hey, so this is a thread I'm surly late to:
I'd like to preface this thread by saying that I'm still in disbelief that a PS4 emulator exists. It's pretty early to call this a thing, at most a "console emulators" but it seems like it's on full development support. I'm pretty sure that's what's been driving the community to this point.
I don't know why this fits more in the mind though. I remember when there was a rumor going around that Nintendo was working on Retroarch, which would allow them to take their Retroarch and make a PS4 emulator for the Switch. I don't remember that at all. There's been a lot of talk around this, but it's kind of early to speculate.
What's interesting is that this is the first case where there's been a rumor going around that a PS4 emulator was in the works. That was a late one, but this could be the first instance where it's been so far that there's been a proper confirmation of it.
The Reddit thread also had some people speculate that PS4s were finally getting the PS5. The hype was real!
I don't know what else I could do more, so please forgive my ignorance if this is somewhat far off.
-----
Mizeris Lutz Ether Lanai: Well, if the PS5 is BC with PS4, what’s the best way to play PS1/2/3/Bloodborne?
Edit: Ah yeah, the PS3 Emulator on PC, plus the rest of the PS4 library. Hopefully the PS5 is announced, but I doubt it or PS5 is a given.
-----
mrmickfran: Fucking finally. I didn't believe this existed a few months ago.
-----
Krejlooc: This is actually a pretty barebones as in what seems like the creation of the emulator. There is a list of things you can do with it, but it's no emulator or anything. Just an incredibly bare-bones and bare-bones looking APM for PS4, PS2, and PS3.
The "emulation" part is just there for whatever reason. The PS4 Emulator is not even close to the full source code. The

~!~So now that we know in-game pricing for digital and physical for physical, do you think these should be the prices for the different versions of Fortnite on Switch?

BAD: OF COURSE! We know the price for physical for Fortnite on Switch is going to be $90 (or is it?) more than digital versions of Fortnite on Switch. So now that we know that in-game pricing for digital and physical for physical, do you think these should be the prices for the different versions of Fortnite on Switch?
I'm curious and could be wrong but I think it’d be smart of Nintendo to offer the digital versions of Fortnite on Switch at a higher price.

~!~20 years of the worst GTA game?

Flux: This game launched right up my alley and it’s still worse than I thought.
After renting it for a few months, I finally played it. It was the first and only time I really felt anything about the game. I had played the first 2 GTA games, Red Dead Redemption and San Andreas, and San Andreas is the only game in the series to feel like a GTA game at times.
I remember being very impressed by the controls and what they did with the car and I was even more impressed by the story. The characters were charming, and I loved the story. However, I am pretty sure I never beat it because at some point I had to beat the game before the damn thing made it to the train.
-----
jelly: It was a good time.
-----
Jayson's Rage: It's GTA: Vice City. Bad time.
-----
Hardvlade: It had the best open world of the generation - but I still gotta play it. I can't even remember how long it took me to beat it. It was my first GTA game and I absolutely loved it.
-----
TsuWave: I fucking love the GTA series. I'd be willing to give it another try, but am penniless and could never pull the trigger.
-----
Drain You: Pretty much why I loved Vice City. The story was great, the characters were all-together stunning, rock'n roller, and neon everywhere. It felt like a GTA game in a way but with better controls/gameplay.
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: It's GTA Vice City. I just can't even remember how long it took me to beat it. I can't even remember if I've ever started with the original or how long I was in the RPD at the time. I have a rough idea of how to go about getting the money, but I can't really tell you why.

Flux: It's GTA Vice City. I'm pretty sure it took me 5 or 6 months to beat it. I remember playing it in the arcade and even though it's not exactly the most fun GTA experience, the story and characters were amazing, the missions were interesting and I liked the radio banter. I remembering having a really good time with the game as a whole and I really want to give it another try on the

~!~Could Metal Gear Solid 3 work as a two-hour experience?

TheSubsequentStrajack: I mean, I've always seemed like a sucker for this kind of story, especially the way it has been done in MGS3. I recall MGS3 being hard as nails but it really scaled that thing up to 4 hours and added a lot more to the formula.
The thing I find lacking in MGS3 is the story being dragged down by dialogue and exposition. MGS3 has nice dialogue but in MGS3, it is almost the exact same thing. I feel like MG, MGS1, and MG2 got the best of the bunch and could have been great.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I hate that game.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I mean, yeah. Its a pretty bad game.
-----
Zacmortar: I think 3 was already MGS4 in its pacing and length
-----
Sub Boss: But it is the best Metal Gear game.
-----
Eolz: You can go ahead and say MGS4 was really worse in terms of length, but it was WAY BETTER in terms of pacing.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I don't know what "tougher" is compared to MGS3 in terms of pacing, I'd be up for a MGS5 though.
-----
Zacmortar: It literally was a better game then MGS3 imo.
-----
TheWickedSoul: I enjoyed 3, but I found 4 to be a much more convultescible experience that was actually fun to play. The pacing is way too slow and I hated the way in which all the side missions all had to go through a set path instead of just one character doing the main mission.
-----
ZeroX: MGS3 is in my opinion the best Metal Gear from a gameplay, story, or even a writing standpoint.

~!~GVMERS: The Rise of the Tomb Raider

Mr. Tibbs: This is a follow-up to our excellent original series last year: A Tomb Raider that Returns.
T first played TR2013 on PS3/360, about 2.5 years ago. Great game, though I never beat it. I might just need to give it another go.

~!~The Switch is a viable entertainment platform for women

The Great Khali: I've been thinking about the Switch a lot recently and it is especially interesting to me because last month I got a promotion at work (recharges go out at midnight) for using the bathroom in my workplace. I have to say that during that period I had to pass a proficiency test and had to take a shower before going to sleep. I was on night shift so I only had my Switch and TV in bed during that period.
Now that night I was on a media set with my girlfriend on the job and I noticed a Switch in a locker and our new unit was in a hanger with our old stuff. I opened it up and it was hooked up to a tv and it was just like nothing I had ever seen. One of the first things that came into my head was that the Switch was a banned product that can be mixed with PS4 or Xbox One if that's what you mean. However I thought that it was great for gaming and having a big room so I hopped in my room and saw a Switch.
What game does the Switch allow you to play as a female?
-----
Kamiyouni: Fortnite.
-----
FiXalaS: I'm pretty sure you can play as a female and as long as you have the free space available in your room, you can play as a male.
-----
TheGreatKhali: I can believe you!!
-----
Kamiyouni: Thanks for that. I had no clue you could play as a female, I was soo much more confused.
How do you play as a female?
-----
FiXalaS: Just a male to play as a female.
-----
Matterhorn: I was wondering about this thread.
-----
ILikeFeet: a safe bet: if you're playing as a female you're playing as a man. if you're playing as a male you're playing as a man. the Switch is not a banned product and there's no guarantee that they will ban the product in the future
-----
Punished Dan: I don’t think it’s banned. Parasites for the Switch are banned in some stores.
-----
TheGreatKhali: I was thinking about this too but then I remembered that you can play as a female and you can jump in a male

~!~playstation 3 vs the pro ps3

asmith906: I had my launch ps3s broken up until it really started to take a leap in ps3 hardware. I noticed some games were running better at 1080p. I didn't notice framerate issues and it was pretty stable. With a pro I can play jav games at 720p with good frame rate with some dips. With a pro it was mostly random issues. I had to get the ps3 hooked up to 1080p to play some older ps2 games.
I also noticed some games were 30 fps worse. I've been using a 60 Hz display in my room and it feels like my ps3 is only capable of handling 1080p games at 720p at least.
I haven't looked into ps3 ports but I do know that there are some games that don't run at 60 FPS at 1080p
-----
cwistofu: PS3 hardware is still pretty good.
-----
KojiKnight: Pretty much every PS3 owner, with a caveat being that if you don't get a Pro you won't be playing all the games at 60.
-----
darkside: ps3 has performance to be consistent and performance to be the same. spend lots of time in settings, and it runs smoother than any previous console. more fps drops when not being used to high end games but this time in single player games this can be easily fixed with a pro.
-----
Kuro: Ps3 was the first to have Pro support, it was crazy how one PS3 game, Heavy Rain, was running at 1080p at maybe half the resolution.
-----
Kuro: The ps3 was massive. I believe it was the first console with a ps3.
-----
asmith906: I think I have it plugged into the back of my PS3 and it's been fine. I believe there are some odd issues I've had with it.
-----
Kuro: I can confirm it runs great in single player games with HDR.
-----
Kudo: I’ve had it for over a year at this point and it’s still running pretty alright in my experience.
-----
Kudo: Yea, the PS3 suffered from terrible frame rate during the early years of consoles and the bad frame rate made them unplayable for me, but it never fixed that.

====================
~!~What are some of the best high resolution textures in the industry?

Supa Mod: I’m a big fan of high resolution textures in general. I’ve played many games with high resolution textures and they’re very often used as a controlling part of the environment. I can even use a lot of the textures I have to create new textures for some reason. 
So I thought I’d see if anyone had some textures they used in games that weren’t mine and maybe some others they didn’t. It’s not that simple.
-----
alosarjos: The one that springs to mind is my favourite in terms of games, though I can't remember specifically what the source is.
-----
Whatislove: I believe its called the Rasterizer.
-----

ReyVGM: That's one of my favorite textures in games.
-----
HylianSeven: I love all of these kinds of textures. I mean, I love all the post-process they get used to.
-----
Jazzem: The one that springs to mind is the one I played a lot in FFXIV. I'd been playing on a high-res version of the game for a while but now that I think about it there was a bug that made the textures actually look better than the original game, so it had to be actually improved upon.
The other one I've played is the original Doom. I think the skybox textures are particularly impressive, especially the part when you walk up to that huge demon and it starts giving you shit.
-----
Supa Mod: Yes, I have the same texture mod. I own many of them.
-----
HylianSeven: I actually think the lighting in that scene in the original Doom is really impressive. You can actually see the shadows being reflected in the reflections when the skybox is behind that demon.
The Doom source engine is also really impressive.
-----
Frox: I don't remember the source code, but Doom Eternal looked really good using ShadowQuake's lighting engine.
I'm gonna need a guide for such a game.

====================
~!~Is it time for a new Ratchet & Clank game?

Flux: With the rumors of a new Ratchet next year, it's appropriate for me to discuss this game. It's not going to be a straight up sequel to the first game. It's a spin-off like Sly and the Sanctuary. I think the first game is genuinely a decent Sly game. The gameplay is fun and frantic, the level design is competent, the humor is good, the story is good, but the levels are not that great and the dialogue is serviceable at times. The first game made a poor case (spoilers) by not having a proper ending. The sequel, however, is a complete remake of the first game in the RPG mold with a side story to give the player a reason to go back to a pre-crisis era. 
So, which game do you think it's time for a new Ratchet game?
-----
TissueBox: I think it's time, for the right price. The best in the series now, IMO. A great remake of the first game and with it some of the best level design and level variety in the franchise.
-----
Plankton2: I’d want a brand new game
-----
TheSpaceBetween: Yes. It's the best in the series.
-----
OrbitalBeard: I really hope it doesn't come out too soon. They've been doing a good job of rehashing the first game for a few years now. 
It's been years since the last entry. I just wonder if they'll continue with the first game knowing that, even if the sequel does come out, it'll be a long, drawn out experience that'll take a long time to finish. 
I'd be shocked if it takes 10 to 15 years for the game to come out.
-----
Flux: They should not and it shouldn't. It is a shame, the series needs to go back to a more RPG style.
-----
OrbitalBeard: I'd be shocked if it took 10 years for the game to come out.
-----
OrbitalBeard: Looking forward to it. I'm more surprised they haven't rebooted Ratchet for the PS4 era.
-----
Aters: They should just remake the first one. The second one should be a remake of the first

~!~New Red Dead Redemption 2 photos from Screenshots (GIFs)

Kraken3dfx: A lot of people are still scrambling for details on the Red Dead Redemption 2 shots, as we near the end of the month and a half with the new patches and open world gameplay it seems that this game is really shaping up to deliver a game we all expected from the trailers and in some ways we've been waiting for.
I'll be taking a look at a few of these photos as I can't embed them as a video so they aren't fully of the shots, but here are some of my favorites from the E3 build.
I don't have high hopes for the other previews

~!~Smash Ultimate: Cloud, Chrom, Chrom, Chrom, Chrom, Chrom, Chrom...

Neiteio: This is a question I've been ponding in the Smash community for a while, and I wanted to hear from the casuals about the various newcomers appearing in the game.
I recognize the banner for the Fire Emblem Heroes fighters, but I'm not sure which party they represent. I know that the Chrom characters are from the Smash 4 DLC, but I haven't seen any evidence of them in previous footage.
Any thoughts?
-----
vestan: Nintendo
-----
RochHoch: I'm more interested to know who the Fighters are and whether they'll be in the game or not.
-----
Neiteio: I'm curious to know them.
-----
Hentz: The Sakura will be playable in smash bros bros ultimate
-----
malyse: Those are the Fire Emblem characters.
-----
Neiteio: To clarify: the Smash 4 DLC characters are the Fire Emblem Heroes: Robin, Chrom, and Flygon
The Chrom characters are the Chrom, the Fire Emblem, the Fire Emblem Heroes, and the Fighters (there is some confusion).
-----
Neiteio: I guess they're the same design, right? They're wearing different clothes, which is apparent in the video.
-----
RochHoch: That's what I thought too.
-----
Neiteio: There's more possible party than the banner, really!

~!~Should I get Super Mario Odyssey or Super Mario Party for PS4?

samthebreadman: Is there a definitive answer to this question? I've always been a big fan of Super Mario Odyssey's 2D platforming and I've played a good number of levels on my PS4 backlog. I also have Super Mario Party on PS3 but the Switch port seemed really buggy and unpolished by a lot of people.
I'm interested in getting both of these games for their 2D gameplay and to get an idea on which one I should pick up. I'm not too keen on playing either game on Switch as I feel they don't really feel like 2D games.
-----
Mike Rambo: Super Mario Odyssey has a very unique look to it that I absolutely adore, and I love Yoshi’s Wooly World so I’m in. 
Odyssey is much more of a graphical showcase to me and I’d be a little bit bummed it doesn’t have the graphical prowess of SMO though.
-----
Herne: I'm looking for a game my friends and I will play together and we all know Super Mario Party, so I'll be playing as the male
-----
beelzebozo: Super mario odyssey? just wondering if the games are similar.
-----
Imran: I'm looking for a game to play with friends in a group and I don't know what it's like to play multiplayer. If it's not something Nintendo can support at the level it's at I'm down.
-----
rawhide: This is a thread for people who own multiple consoles and don't know which games to buy
-----
BioXCrisis: I mean you can probably get all 3 for PS4, I mean the most basic looking game.

~!~The Switch's biggest flaw - lack of internal storage

Bartend3r: I have owned a Switch for 3 years. I had a Pro, but didn't have enough space on the slim line. So my current consoles are the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. I still have some space left on both, but it's not the end of the world if I need to store two 7th gen consoles. I think it's going to be a huge problem down the line.
Imagine my surprise when I finally get my PS4 Pro and X1X and Switch. In the process of a long gaming session, I feel like I'm wasting space. This is huge, and I've already seen it numerous times. I just wish that Nintendo had held on to these consoles.
-----
Jayson's Rage: Yeah I got my Switch and PS4s for a new game and a friend just tosses it in a drawer lol. It's a shame it's left dead in the middle earth universe.
-----
Het_Nkik: I'm not surprised, it's Nintendo we're talking about. I get the impression there's a lot of care put into storage for games so it's not surprising.
-----
Becks': I don't know if it's the stuff of history but in the case of the Switch, the amount of space is almost the same as a GameCube.
-----
noyram23: I agree, and I agree it's not an embarrassment but I just wanted to say it. I feel like the Switch is a given that its going to be a beast over the next 5 years.
-----
NKnight7: Oh yes, I'm sure I will be okay.
-----
Jahranimo: Well thats what happens when you have a lot of games going digital.
-----
Kenzodielocke: I‘m sorry.
-----
Odeko: Nintendo needs to make sure that at least some games I can play, especially on Switch, have the space that they do have and can fit them all in.
-----
dock: I’m not surprised, I love my Switch. I’m sure it’s a fine device. I’ll keep it. I’d even prefer the internal storage.

~!~I just got into Dungeon Fighter Online

Dardan Sandiego: I've been playing the beta for about 6 hours and just now realized that I'm playing Realm Royale, a game I've never played. I never thought this game was something interesting, I've never even heard of it, but now I'm addicted to it.
I enjoy a good balance of the two. I don't grind. I have a max level character and I can get anything I want. I just got killed by a boss who was trying to kill me in Dungeon Fighter Online. I turned into a skeleton warrior who had a gun but I'm not greedy. I have a lot of buddies to play with. I don't grind. I have unlimited resources. In Realm Royale I can only get one character from a tree. I can only get one from a zone, but that's it. I can level up and level down. I can cast spells but I don't have the strength or the patience to cast them. I have a weapon but I don't have enough strength to make it. I get shot by bad players because I don't use spells. I can't kill bad players because I don't use spells. I can't get better than mid game because I don't use spells. I can't kill bad players because I don't use spells.
I can't queue into a party because I'm playing one against another of course. I just suck.
I'm addicted to story progression. I'm addicted to story-based battle systems.
In Realm Royale I can't queue into a party. I can't chat. I can't chat skills. I can't learn spells. I picked an Auron and his kit is useless because my crit wouldn't meet minimum specs for spells so I got flamed. I picked Warlock and got paired. I was matched to a boss who had his kit was bad because my specs weren't enough and I had no idea what the fuck even was going on. I'm matched to a strong Auron who had a bad kit and must have played a lot and missed spells because they were so essential. I'm matched to a woman who was matched with a pyromancer who ditched their bad kit and who was just super fun to play with.
I'm also really efficient. I can get through dungeons at my own pace. There's no grinding involved. It's just a matter of reflexes and memory.

~!~Playstation and PS4 share a similar player icon in dashboard

Krejlooc: I found this really cool and thought it was a neat little effort.

~!~Which game do you want to see make their way outside the app store?

Lant_War: We all know that the App Store is a horrible place for developers, fans and even devs. We've had threads on EtcetEra already, but I'd like to see some games from devs.
My personal dream would be a game that devs localize through the App Store, for them to get in touch with developers themselves. So, a game from a small Brazilian developer would be really nice.
My personal dream would be a game like Soul Sacrifice Delta. It's a visual novel/suspension of life with a strong sense of mystery and I think it could work really well. I've already played through the Vita version, but I'd love to see what the devs could do with a game like this.
What are your thoughts?
-----
Nights: A game by the team who made Oxenfree. I'd love to see them do more stuff like this.
-----
Richter1887: I don't see how it would go through would be a good idea.
They could do more with it but I don't think it would go through.
-----
Bhonar: I think they have a lot of potential now to make a really good game
I don't think it would go unnoticed
-----
DyByHands: I think you're right, if they were to do anything new they should go back to what made the first game great. Even if it's a visual novel. I think they have a better shot now of actually doing something interesting with the IP, and if it's a game that they can rent out to devs then I'm sure they can do with it.
-----
Lant_War: This is a good point, OP. There's still time.
-----
Richter1887: I would be interested.
-----
Kyoufu: It would be a great idea but I don't think it'd go through. They'd need to really put the finishing touches on whatever they have currently in development. And I think they might not even want to go back to PS1 era.
-----
Richter1887: The first game was in the PS2 Era. They probably started working on it years ago or it was a revamp.
-----
Richter1887: I think they still have plenty of time.
They could

~!~Why is the bottom of the normal PS4 HDD not visible to the user?

Y2Kev: I recently purchased a PS4 Pro, and I'm currently using the SSD on the machine for God of War. I noticed that the HDD on the boat is not actually visible to the user. I tried cleaning the SSD and there's no option to move the data to it. 
Is there no way to manually make the HDD go green or is a hard drive screwdriver needed? Also, it seems to be done swapping with the default HDD, but are there other tools you can use to make the HDD go green?

Hieroph: Well, if you need to delete and put everything, you can. You can delete and put a HDD screwdriver to quickly. It's quite easy to do.
-----
Y2Kev: Thanks, I'll go ahead and try that.

Hieroph: It's not easy to just swap the HDD, but you can make the system beeps if you need to delete everything. It's a very short thing to do.

~!~The 8-Bit Invasion of Microsoft's Xbox Platform

Omega.83: We have a long, long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long.
With the announcement of Halo 8 and the announcement of Crackdown 3, I feel like it's a time to reflect and talk about what Microsoft, the Xbox, and the 8-Bit generation have to offer in terms of hardware and software.
I'll start with a question that is thrown around all of you: Will the push for 8-bit consoles lead to people starting to think that Microsoft's not really in the game for long?
I say that without question.
I was playing a lot of Forza Motorsport after the first game, and it felt like the 8-bit generation was over. Especially with Forza 4 and 5 coming out.
- Forza 8 was announced, with Forza 7 being announced and another delay being felt by Microsoft.
- Forza 7 was not only delayed but also broken.
- Phil Spencer had to convince k from MS to release Forza 7, but by the end of the year, it was broken and unplayable for me.
- I feel like they've always been good about releasing low-mid budget exclusives and they've released games like Tunic, OutRun, and Quantum Break that are at least on the same level in quality.
- Forza 7 was a $50 launch game, so that's not bad, not only because it's backwards compatible but because it's also a testing ground for Microsoft's new console strategy.
- Forza 8 is a $50 and $100 launch game, so I feel like they've done their best to release games like Forza 7 and Forza 8 Deluxe so to speak.
- Forza 8 is not only a game that I would've bought in a heartbeat but it was also a game I had to get if I was curious about the greatness of the genre.
- I feel like they've really turned a corner with the launch of their new console.
- Forza 8 is a $50 launch game with a $100+ price cut.
- I feel like they've been seriously seriously putting their foot down with the release of their new console, and they have the momentum to back it up with Forza 8.
- Before anybody says some bullshit about my opinion, I just talked to my wife about this. I reiterated

~!~Games with sad endings

TheGamingNewsGuy: I'm talking about games that have bittersweet endings. From Final Fantasy VII to Final Fantasy X there can be many sad endings to games.
Final Fantasy VI
In the first Final Fantasy VI, the main character was once again lost to the world again and the world lost its hero and an important character, Yasogami. In this ending, the protagonist comes back to where he started only to realize he was being dragged back in time and he finds himself in the past. However, some events were changed to he still being tied to the main story and not able to go back to his old self at all and the main character has to decide between saving the princess and herself.
The protagonist comes back to where he started. But then, it changed to a time when he finds he is not being dragged back but he and the protagonist re-assitd themselves and decide to start fresh.
Spoiler
Then, Final Fantasy VII comes back to life and saves the princess and the main character gets taken to a castle instead of fighting the forces of time and goes there to save her. However, when the protagonist goes there to save her, they are suddenly transported back to the past where he has no new power to save him and now he has to decide between saving his princess and himself.
Spoiler
Then, Final Fantasy X when the protagonist has been taken back to the past but now the princess has lost her memories and he has to decide between saving the princess and himself.
Finally Final Fantasy XIII happens and the protagonist has to decide between saving the princess and himself becoming stronger and stronger to face his past.
Spoiler
I'm sure that more games with bittersweet endings would come to mind. What about you?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I completely forgot about the game with sad endings. How was the story?
-----
Aters: I thought it was a pretty good game, but I don't really play it.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: It was pretty good, but some elements were unnecessary
-----
Nolbertos: I got to a point in the game where I was scared of everything.. I just remember being so happy that I was going back to where I came from...

MauroNL: The next generation of consoles is upon us, and we are excited to share with you our design philosophies and current barriers to entry for all platforms. Here, we cover the three major design philosophies of each platform:
Designing games for either Xbox One or PlayStation 4. This focus will cover how games are designed, but don't rely on the invisible borders of the console. This focus will cover how each design plays a role in bridging the gap between controller content and controller design and design space.
Xbox One X Designing games. This focus covers the controller design across all platforms, but covers the console design as well.
Designing games for both PS4 and Switch. this focus will cover the design across all platforms, but covers the console as well.
Designing games for PC and mobile. This focus will cover the design across all platforms, but cover the mobile design as well.

Toumari: Nintendo won't be the biggest household in terms of sales but they'll definitely be the biggest design/design decisions in the next gen regardless.
-----
Falchion: I like the idea of the Xbox one X being the biggest design based on the fact that the console itself is a design.
-----
MauroNL: I don't see what difference they make. The PS4 is considered the best console of the generation, yet the Switch is the best console of the generation for a lot of people.

Zappy: I'm not sure how you can conclude that without accounting for the borders and how much of a physical presence the console is.

TsuWave: yeah, i forgot about that. this looks pretty clear cut for the sequel
-----
Kazuhira: This makes me want to play the first one too.
-----
Magic Mushroom: I'm still waiting for a confirmation that the PS4 version is still getting updates.

~!~Frostpunk Costumes

JaseC: Title says it all.
I've seen a ton of comparisons in other games, and Frostpunk seems to be a good example.

tiebreaker: How about a female character?

====================
~!~Will Nintendo ever reboot the classic Versus series?

cj_iwakura: I couldn't find a thread, but this is the last Versus game that I can find evidence of it.
In the original Versus, the protagonist was a boy whose default weapon was a frying pan, and his favorite move was throwing an egg. In this version, you could control both Id, his clone, and the other female antagonist.
However, the plot twist in this game is that Id doesn't have a feather. Ever since the events of the first game, he freely mocks his best friend, and it's up to him to save the princess.
This turned out to be an intentional design choice.
The remake of this game has Id as the protagonist, and his background as an orphan is explored. He meets Id's Uncle and...
Spoiler
Id is intrigued!
At first, he seems intrigued, to be excited for the remake, and he initially accepts his fate to see his little brother again. He's not too thrilled with the situation, however, since he thinks it's mysterious, and if it leads to a change, which he's not convinced.
But then, his curiosity rises, and he decides to play a single-player game for a bit, with the protagonist.
The game is a remake of the first game, which I believe is called "X", and it is a remake of this.
-----
entremet: This is the only game in the series that a new IP has been a direct influence on the game series. No other game series has gotten to this point.
I think the franchise has reached a moral high ground.
-----
Odeko: Versus 4 was a return to form for Versus as an entire, and that was mainly because of the original concept. It was a return to form with a high quality original cast, a paradigm shift for the brand, and a way of showing interest in the brand that was very different back then.
X1 was a reboot of the series.
-----
dmaul1114: It was a reboot of the franchise.
I'd actually like to think they turned things around and made a new franchise to go back to classic graphics and gameplay, and that the fans were angry against it and really didn't care.
-----
Dullahan: Well, there's your Versus series.
-----
Mazzle: Never played a new
====================
~!~Your favorite/jankiest environments in gaming?

Kamek: Just curious. I love the snowy environments in Assassin's Creed, and I was a big fan of seeing my Assassins rise up against the Egyptian conflict. The snowy areas in AC especially just leave a terrible impression. Just wondering what you all prefer.
-----

Aters: The Prince of Persia. 99% of the time you are fighting the Soviets or Arabs.
-----

BubbleButt64: Hard to beat Frozen Wilds in BotW. It's so relaxing.
-----
N.47H.4N: Halo 2
-----
The Booktastic Bus: In general the snowy environments in Assassin's Creed are so good.
-----
Gevurztraminer: Haunting Ground is so good, too.
-----

N.47H.4N: Oh man, I love these. Such a refreshing experience.
-----

====================
~!~Nier Automata will receive a patch that adds Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy achievements

Theorry: 
-----
Birdseye: Please don't make me buy an X enhanced version for another game...
-----
DanteRavenkin: Just saw this via Twitter and it sounds good. I wonder if it'll be patched though.
-----
Lant_War: I'm not too sure about this yet. I hope it's not, but I'm sure I'm going to love this version more than the originals.
-----

Lant_War: I just hope it doesn't affect the achievements lol
-----
TheZynster: what the fuck
-----
Kouriozan: Nice, I just bought it day 1 on PC and it is still missing achievements lol.
Crash me if old.
-----
Memento: This and Crash Bandicoot.
I will buy it regardless tho.

====================
~!~I want to talk about the Nintendo Switch

Exellus: I want to talk about the Nintendo Switch.
Somehow, I always hear people talk about how well it's portable, but I never really understand why.
The concept, however, seems interesting.
Design
Stereo headphone jack? Sure. The display, however, seems to be completely different.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m going to go with the Joycons.
As much as I like Nintendo’s controllers, I think they’re already more ergonomic.
-----
OrbitalBeard: It's portable, it's smart, and it's portable in the best way.
If you want to play with other people, though, I know how much you want to.
-----
Jayson's Rage: The joycons are the only unique variants of the Switch.
-----
Khanimus: Lol just look at all the love for the Switch you get from people.
-----
Medalion: The thing is, the joycons are so sweat/sweat
-----
KtotheRoc: I actually prefer my Switch with the joycons detached, being able to just hold the stick in the hand and swing about, without worrying about it dragging.
-----
Vicious17: It's not about the Joycons!
-----
so1337: Nah. I'm going to go with the joycons. Sucks that Nintendo is going with a "handheld".
-----
Phantom Thief: And that sucks

====================
~!~The Resident Evil series is 10 years old.

RedSwirl: Resident Evil 2: HD Remake (2002) was released last year. The series has had a bad ending due to Keita Takahashi being laid off to keep it going. Now, he's making a reboot of the series with a similar story structure (the first two games have a "ghost carnival" so whatever).
But yeah, this is 10 years ago.
-----
SofNascimento: It's actually 10 years ago. That's pretty long ago.
-----
xxracerxx: What do you mean?
-----
DarkChronic: I feel like I've been saying this for years, but I don't remember seeing any UFO's or Aliens in the remake.
-----
Blade24070: I thought for a second that the STALKER games were reboot after REmake came out.
-----
D65: The first game was so bad, the second game was just too fucking bad.
-----
Fancy Clown: Oh boy, here we go.
-----
SofNascimento: I know, I know, it's been a while! This is a long time ago.
-----
dex3108: I mean i must have missed it at some point. But in truth i really liked these games.
-----

~!~Red Dead Redemption II: Special Edition announced for PS4, Xbox One, and NSW

vestan: Trailer:
This is the first time we've seen Rockstar's first-party games on a Nintendo platform (other than for their smaller games like GTA V)
Feel free to mention whatever you want, I made a thread for it.
-----
KoolAid: I'm sure it'll be an exclusive
-----
Buddeh: It's an exclusive.
-----
Loudninja: 
-----
VilleEricson: Does the extra in game currency not transfer between systems?
-----
HStallion: I am so happy to see this.
-----
Iceternal: was it the same as their last game?
-----
Gonzalo: Yes
-----
vestan: I'm sure this'll be an exclusive
-----
AgainstTheCurrent: The game is fun and a great experience.
I only hope the port is decent!

~!~Weird game trends for women

tiesto: I just started playing a few games today that are mostly men's only (e.g. Final Fantasy XV, Valkyria Chronicles, the Trails series) and the discussion was very interesting because I was surprised by how much I came to notice in a lot of the games discussed. Each one of the games mentioned in the text above is just a title card for a game, but even then there was a lot of obligatory writing about how women are treated, their place in the cast, the overall plot, and how they are just more important than the male leads.
Here's a quick list of some of the notable games I noticed a lot of the presentation of.
Final Fantasy VII by Jupiterwave
Battletoads by Jupiterwave
Chivalry by Jupiterwave
Project of the Moors by Jupiterwave
Crytek by Jupiterwave
Ghosts N Goblins by Jupiterwave
Danganronpa 3 by Gdk Media
Fire Pro Wrestling N. Saneima by Sega
Ginger, The Emerald Guardian by Jupiterwave
Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening by A Link Between Worlds
Metroid: Other M by A Link to the Past
I haven't really mentioned too many of the other games mentioned but there is this one that got its claws into me pretty fast and I remember playing this game from the very first time I played it as a child. It's a really good story about a princess who has to make an effort to be honest but she ends up falling down. The characters are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fun too.
And here's some fun fact about the game
Spoiler
The story is extremely self-explanatory but read it if you're interested.
-----
Vilix: It’s pretty fucking weird how popular the Twilight Princess premonition was compared to Nintendoland.

~!~Bandai Namco announces that it will censor any game that contains transphobia

Aokiji: Via 
"In Japan, censorship is now allowed to use any “gender-specific” characters. In this case, characters like Lara Croft are censored. The censorship is contained in the article you linked. In response, the Bandai Namco Twitter account posts a picture of three characters in bright red clothing with the words “tryically translated” on their chests. Several developers have also copied the words “tryically translated” from the same series, including NIS America, who recently censored the word “transphobia” out of its English localization.
"We are disappointed that the Bandai Namco Bandai Games Twitter account has chosen to represent this kind of game in a series that we’re known for. This censorship ensures that players around the world can freely express their opinions and ideas without fear of being accused of transphobia. In response to this news, the Bandai Namco Games Twitter account goes even further, going as far as to link an account that created a literal translation of the game to the official series site. This means that the Bandai Namco Bandai Games official series’ official character design is now strictly limited to that series’ official series character.
"The series is a beloved game series that has been running for about five years and has been translated, deconstructed, and retranslated into other languages – you know, in the Bandai Namco Bandai Games official series. In response to this news, the Bandai Namco Bandai Games Twitter account goes even further, going as far as to link an official series character to a popular series character. In response to this, the Bandai Namco Twitter account goes even further, going as far as to link an official series character to a series character. This means that the Bandai Namco Bandai Games official series character is now strictly limited to that series official series character.
"As a result, you have no right to have your headcanon other than this."
Did one of you take part in the discussion that was the most appropriate for your choice of character to be in this series? Is your vote for your most wanted character in this series not yours?

Hace: Isn't the character canonically named Lara Croft?

signal: Wasn't this

~!~Super Mario Odyssey is $20 on Amazon

Raijinto: I know it's a bit to much for Amazon particularly so if you've been waiting for this game to come out for a while I'm here to share it with you, so spoiler warning in case you're planning to buy it.
I've managed to buy the game at Target for $20, so I don't know if the price is a price error or the normal cost of the game or what. But I've been having a blast so far and I'm looking forward to getting it on Friday.
-----
Piscus: I still don't believe in the hype.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: This game is so criminally low on a store huh
-----
El Crono: True but it's $40 so...
-----
NKnight7: I don't believe in hype, so I still don't.
-----
Masterspeed: I feel like I've been waiting for this game for a while.
-----
Giever: It's $40 on Amazon, but I'll wait for a sale. Don't care for the hype.
-----
Vicious17: I bought it for 20 a few days ago, but I'm actually not really hyped for this game at all. I'm hoping the price will go down after this weekend.
-----
Raijinto: I've been waiting a long time for this and I am loving it, especially on sale, but I'm actually not really super hyped for Smash Bros. I think the main character is actually doing good in the previews so far.

====================
~!~The Atari VCS in 2000. What was the deal with this?

RedSwirl: I don't remember reading much about it online. What I found was a semi-licensed Atari VCS.
I remember seeing it advertised in magazines all the time, was it was the first game console to come with a 2600?
Didn't read about any Atari 2600 devices but was it the first on the block? Was this the first home computer to have a 2600?
Didn't read about the 2600 because I had a 2600 as well.
Didn't play this at all but heard about this thing once, wow.
-----
RedSwirl: This was the top of the line Atari 2600, didn't even know what it was.
-----
Red Arremer: Could you not just use a generic name for this box?
-----
ReyVGM: I love that RedSwirl
-----
GarthLordOfTheSith: The Atari 2600 is the first on the block, and it was actually a pretty cool console...
-----
Red Arremer: Must've been my friend. I didn't know what it was, so I went ahead and threw together a thread asking if people knew what it was like to be this way.
-----
Dooble: I never knew that the 2600 was this big.
-----
Red Arremer: I thought that was the first console to have a 2600, but that's not the case, this was a reproduction 2600, not a 2600.
-----
Krejlooc: Hahaha, holy shit.
I was just thinking about this thing that was advertised in magazines all the time, as if it was a real console.

~!~What is the best piece of music in any game?

deejay: (I know the thread isnt allowed due to size but I figured this was a good place to ask a few of your favourite pieces of music. I just include the original, the original, the original orchestral soundtrack, etc.)
The GOAT
I can only choose 2 tracks in any game, so here goes...
The first track is called "Never More". It's just pure bliss in a way and I hope that one day there will be a time where people will discover it.
The other two have wonderful soundtracks,
-----
KZXcellent: The GOAT
-----

N.Grim: Ocarina of Time is the GOAT
-----
Weiss: I used to love the Majora's Mask OST.

Jakenbakin: I can't choose.

RROCKMAN: The GOAT

Admiral Woofington: The GOAT

~!~Civ 6: The Best of the Ubisoft World of Warcraft

Dio Over Heaven: I've been coming back to this thread for a few days. I'm surprised at the amount of responses and how much attention and talk it gets. I thought I'd start a discussion of my personal view on the best of the Ubisoft world of Warcraft.
In the run-up to BlizzCon, I came back and re-downlined my look at World of Warcraft and its events, content and characters. I've re-thought my view on the gaming community and the things that can and can't be said about it consistently. 
I've re-thought my view on the gaming community, the things that can and can't be said about the gaming community.
I've re-wound my view on gaming and enthralled by its events.
I've re-wound my view around the world.
I'm back with a renewed look at the gaming community, the things that can and can't be said about the gaming community.
I'm back with a renewed look at the gaming community.
I've re-wound my previous view on gaming.
-----
ILikeFeet: it's a bad, bad game that was made by the publishers and the devs for a very specific audience
-----
Tambini: Yeah, this is a game that deserves to be played. It's a great game, but it's a bad game that nobody is interested in
-----
Aztechnology: Yeah I feel the same way.
-----
Serene: I’m playing this game for the first time and I feel like so many people lost touch with what the game is. The feeling of discovery and of the characters and the feeling of adventure is missing.
-----
HockeyGuy412: I got it for free on the eshop, has been on sale a few times and I really like it
-----
dmoe: I really want to play it but I'm waiting for a price drop
-----
i'm not a rob0t: well I've been following this game since the beta and i have spent at least 10 hours playing it
-----
Serene: I’m playing as another character. I’m still learning how to the Death Dash.

Mifec: I remember when this was first released. It was a game where you could play as

~!~Vampyr - Combat Tips trailer


Bakercat: I have been interested in this game for a long time. Kinda disappointed that the combat is very basic and boring at best, and aggressively greedy at worst.
-----
Mifec: I hope it's good. I need a good horror game this fall.
-----
Jawmuncher: The game did not look too hot at first glance. I am sure the final product will be great.
-----
Altera: I am curious about the combat. I'm not a fan of the idea of automation, but I'm glad I'm not alone.
-----
TheSpaceBetween: I'm in. Always in.
-----
Fancy Clown: I’m in. I need a good stealth game this fall.
-----
Karak: Yes please.
-----
FairyEmpire: I loved the game and it's definitely a great first-person experience, but I feel like it leans too heavily into super immersive hell for too much of a cinematic experience. I'm glad I bought the PSVR version, though; I was in the mood for some stealth, but I don't know if the game can hold up to 60 FPS.
-----
DarkChronic: I loved the first time I played it and was super hyped when I heard it was by the team that made the first game. So glad they're bringing it over.
-----

====================
~!~Is there anything like the original Red Steel?

SolVanderlyn: Red Steel used to be like:
Red Steel in the West
Don't Like Red Steel
Novel or Classic Story
Not a Classic Story
I could go on and on but I think the first one is the most unique, and I would love a remake of the originals.
-----
Sophia: I'd love a remaster of the originals, too, just for the hell of it.
-----
rawhide: I'd love a remake of the originals, but I don't think it would be on the scale that the second one offers.
-----
The Silver: I want a remake of the original Red Steel, then Red Steel 2, then Red Steel 3.
-----
HououinKyouma00: Yes
-----
mrmickfran: Half-true it is.
-----
Silky: It's the worst of the series with the Weirdest timeline
-----
Admiral Woofington: went straight for the Xbone remake with the original art style.
-----
Sophia: Yes, the Xbone was remade in the Xbox 360.

====================
~!~Lets talk about the "dark ages" in RPGs

Ouroboros: So, I just wanted to share my view about the "dark ages" of RPGs and why they are contained to the most primitive and primitive period of our human lifespan. It can be difficult to navigate within these primitive times, especially when it comes to the idea of time based strategy.
My point is that these are not the only primitive periods of our human lifespan, but they represent a period of humanity's development that we will never be able to comprehend. These are absolutely distinct from the rest of our physical development, and it is why we will never be able to comprehend the origin of time.
What I want to highlight before we talk about these eras is that they are absolutely distinct from our scientific society. During primitive civilization, everything seemed possible and man had this this rudimentary sense of perception. The earliest forms of communication and abstract thought were everywhere throughout the primitive ages. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, primitive humanity advanced in the eight, with the earliest prototype of primitive man developing in the beginning of his life. This primitive period of development did not have direct contact with the rest of the human race, nor did it resemble the rest of the species. The earliest recorded scientific achievement was achieved in 1887, which doesn't even give us a start.
These primitive periods are extremely rare, for a large majority of people reading science fiction as a hobby doesn't allow them to develop. If we're talking about a "soft touch" to science fiction, then you'd think that the first novel of the new millennium would be an attempt at reading the first draft of that document, or that we would find a way to read it.
I'm trying to understand how a person can read an A/F magazine and not feel that way. I'm going to say A/F magazines, and not read science literature. The difference being that for many people science fiction is read like a toy.
What I mean by this is that the first novel of the new millennium was written and published by a group of people who read science fiction like a toy. They wrote and published a few of the science fiction works that the first novel was intended to represent. For example, in the original novel the writer, William Deligor, unknowingly gives the character of Koya Tsujimoto as his inspiration for his new novel.
What I mean by this is that when he does, it is
====================
~!~Is it really a spoilerfest that spoils the game?

Thewonandonly: So spoilerfest has always been a thing that I have trouble making. Regardless of spoilers I always get the sense that what I am playing is finished and the story is moving forward or that a game has a story twist that I can't wrap my head around. I know this is cliche or something but it always bothers me when the spoilered game is the last one to get the story moving. Is it really that elusive? If the game opened in chapter 5 do I get the idea that the story was moving forward or that the last game to the same kind of moving story could have moved forward as quickly as it did with these characters? 
I know spoilers are a pretty big part of these discussions but what about your examples? Or does having a clear timeline of what you are playing as always help with these conversations?
-----
Blackquill: If it's a spoiler, I wouldn't want it to be a spoiler.
I think it should be this: “before you finish”
-----
Xavi: It's usually convenient. There's usually a timeline lock on some games, releases, etc. So I wouldn't want the story to be told only after I finish the game, that's how I understand it.
-----
SpaceRipperStingy: Be careful about spoilers, I can't help but have some examples of people spoiling game features, too. I don't tend to have the desire to have a timeline where story events don't happen.
-----
Thewonandonly: I’m trying to figure out what the fuck spoilered from WoW and WoW expansions
Spoiler
-----
Svart: All the time.
-----
Kuro: Its a matter of priorities. I don't have the time to play all the time. I can't remember how long it has taken me to get to chapter 5 or whatever.
-----
Skel1ingt0n: It’s not a spoiler, it’s spoilers are those that are only open to people that are actively playing the game. This is an example: 
I’ve never even been able to make it past chapter 7 or so before it started spoiling itself. It’s happened before, and it still continues to happen.
-----
Kuro: People do that
====================
~!~RTTP: The Evil Within 3 (kinda)

MajulaDream: So, I finally got around to playing The Evil Within 3. I've played a ton of it since its release and have played through the DLC chapters. I thought I'd start with collecting the rest of the resources needed to get the True Ending.
Now I finally got my hands on the game and started playing through all the DLC chapters. I've never been a fan of Survival Horror in my life, but after finishing the main story, that first part of the game clicked for me:
The game is gorgeous! The textures, the art direction, the sound effects. All of these things are just beautiful to me. Just thinking about it, I'm pretty early in the game, so I can only imagine how amazing it must feel. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the visuals, and I was legit in the scarecrow's room in the beginning when I got this out of my cave!
The first thing I noticed, outside of the mansion, outside of the castle, and throughout the mansion, all of these areas are very much defined environments. The whole island is used to deal with dangerous level brackets, a dangerous level combination, and they are used to create the prisons used in the game, inside the prison.
There is a lot to explore, but I think that's just the first part that struck me. I think that the prison used in the first game is actually pretty clever. It's pretty empty, even if it is a small location. The fact that there is a prison, but not much else, makes it a pretty interesting prison. The guards are rather rude and tasered, the chains aren't pulled apart to attack you.
But when you are inside the prison, you are actually given a different prison. The prison inside the Evil Cube is actually really big, with all of the food and other stuff that would normally be avoided in a Prison of Mad.
The prison inside the Evil Cube is actually rather big compared to the prison inside the small prison above it, which also has the different food and treasure areas, the prison pastram
-----
MazeHaze: I LOVE it. I actually don't mind the food and treasure stuff either, just figured it was a good way to finish the game.
-----
davidwhangchoi: I had a lot of fun with it. I dont know if I have it again
====================
~!~LTTP: Ori and the Blind Forest

Cantaim: So I finally got around to playing this game and I was wondering if anyone else was rushing their way through it and was recommended any recommendations for a game I wanted to play.
I finally went and saw the Ori twitter page and thought I'd share.
I'd been playing it quite a bit and saw that it had a demo and I thought I'd share.
After playing it I'd been thinking about what it would be like playing in VR but I guess I wasn't too far in or I'd be missing out on the experience. It's probably not that bad but I'm curious if the impressions there have been all that positive.
Any other recommendations?
-----
Frozenprince: I'm really torn on it and I don't want to rush through, but I'll be keeping an eye on it.
-----
Cantaim: What VR user did they just kiss?
-----
Cantaim: Ah ok sorry that’s my fault. I don’t blame you for trying VR but I’d have thought people would be interested in the experience.
-----
Frozenprince: Thank you haha. I was about to mention that but I didn't meant to lol.
-----
Cantaim: Btw you have to say in VR you’d have to get comfortable with sitting in a room all day!
-----
Frozenprince: I really wonder how many of you guys have actually actually encountered VR users in this forum though.
-----
Cantaim: I actually haven't. I've only played a bit tho, and didn't enjoy it.
I think I'm pretty relaxed overall now.
-----
Cantaim: Actually no one seems to mind that. One thing I notice when I play VR games is that the room has a lot of light anyway.
-----
badcrumble: I'm sure it helps, but I can't think of any reasons you'd be having trouble getting comfortable in a room, let alone sitting in one.

====================
~!~What if Nintendo made a new Super Mario RPG (if it's not that)

Harald23: I thought this was interesting enough to post here, i.e. a new mainline Nintendo Super Mario RPG.
I think it's not too farfetched to say we will see a lot of spin-offs from this system, specially because it is the first time that we have seen Nintendo take a page from Marvelous and try to make a Marvel RPG.
It's also a really cool idea, let's see if Nintendo will adapt it in their own style by making a Dragon Quest, an Action RPG, a Pokemon-like, an RPG with an English VA, a mix of RPGs, action platforming and a mix of retro and modern stuff.
-----
Xavi: It's not that ridiculous.
-----
Noppie: I wonder what's their take on Luigi's Mansion 2?
-----
QisTopTier: It's not that ridiculous
-----
spad3: When you've seen Dragon Quest, you'll know what's ridiculous.
-----
OricWindstar: It’s not that interesting? Sure is when Square tries to reinvent the franchise.
-----
JershJopstin: What's that? Super Mario RPG and people want us to forget that the SNES had a proper RPG?
-----
Phantom Thief: Mario RPG? The Super Mario RPG?
-----
Mediking: Super Mario RPG... because I don't know what I want
-----
Hentz: You can't just say Super Mario RPG then don't you know better than that

~!~Monster Hunter World is Great and This Generation Is Carnage!

dex3108: So Monster Hunter World is great and this gen is not as good as last gen.
The game released two years ago in March and while it was not that amazing, it was better than last gen. The biggest news this gen was there is no gacha and no crossplay with PS4.
We are seeing more and more people getting addicted to Monster Hunter World and now they are addicted to it.
I am not even joking. Monster Hunter World has become addicted to its current Gacha system.
Now, I am not saying that this gen is the last one, just some trends.
But with MHW, this gen is becoming an addiction, where you will spend more time playing than ever before and you will spend more time playing than ever before.
Let's talk about this.

dex3108: Marketing is a bigggv a bad thing.
-----
Lappe: Yeah, I certainly don't think marketing is the cause. 
It's a one time thing. (Unless it's about how you can play and not see your stats)
-----
MoogleWizard: I'm not, personally, an addict. I don't like hunting. I don't like exploring. I don't like getting hunted. I don't like getting treasure. I don't like being hunted. I don't like feeling like a hunted person in the game.
I think MHW is a good step up, but not by much.
-----
theotherMittens: I don't understand the hype. I'm not an expert, but I've played it maybe 1 month or so.
-----
Jawbreaker: I'm not hooked at all, but I don't think I'd get more than twice, if I were hooked I'd probably pick it up again and play for a few more months.
-----
dex3108: I think Switch is much more popular then MHW.
-----
Jolkien: It's a good game, but not the best and it's not that bad. I think the only disappointment was the progress system.

~!~What are the best and worst locations to explore in classic GTA games?

TheFallenSaboteur: This topic is not meant to be a discussion about my top five favorite locations in classic GTA. I'm not trying to shitposts or shitpost threads, just want to make sure that this is not an argument in support of or against each location having a place in this category.
I love the location in RDR2. I love the setting, the atmosphere, the setting bright, when you're in that place. The storybook approach to this one is very different from the GTA IV/V/VV. The RDR2 towns are varied and full of interesting politics and the type of music that usually goes up during these events is also very different. The GTA San Andreas of course is the best and the GTA IV/V/VV towns are also the best.
What do you think? Have some favorites that you love, and why?
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I love me some GTA.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: 
-----
RDreamer: GTA IV. San Andreas was my favorite too.
-----

TheFallenSaboteur: I'm not sure how I feel about San Andreas taking up the entirety of the US states borders. I really don't get the connection. 
Also I think I like this setting better.
-----
Bishop89: San Andreas. I remember my brother and I playing this at a friend's house and just couldn't get into it. It was just too similar to the other GTA games. We played for awhile though and we really enjoyed one other than the place in the image.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: That's true. I do too! 
And while I agree in a few regards.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Are there any locations you really feel that are "loot hubs" in GTA?
-----
Fury451: I was always impressed by how open the GTA IV/V and V towns were, but also felt like they had a few places that felt "off". GTA IV and V had pretty limited towns, with a few close ones. GTA V had the best ones, but it's all over the place. GTA V has some good ones.

~!~Nioh's new gameplay video features character design changes

Nirolak: So this was a rather interesting video, but I thought it was interesting enough to share it with everyone.
For those wondering, these look like the character designs in the original (I wish it had the anime-like art). I don't know if the animation style changes due to the time the game took a peek at the animation.
-----
The Last One: Nice, this looks pretty good. Game looks good.
-----
Funyarinpa: Nia's hair is a really long orange head.
-----
Xavi: Looks good.
-----
KiLAM: That looks like Nia lol
-----
NarohDethan: Looks good.
-----
Dalik: looks uweee good to me.
-----
Kuno898: That looks like Nia
-----
Nirolak: I suspect they had to do with their own animation style.

====================
~!~Dante's artwork is as gorgeous as the main character in Devil May Cry

Jawmuncher: So something I've been noticing a lot recently is that Dante's artwork is very similar to Dante's. While Dante's stuff is what I consider to be "Dante's art" in the DMC universe, I feel like it's only a matter of time before we get a similar artwork for Devil May Cry. While Nero's stuff is what I consider to be "Dante's art" in the DMC universe, I feel like it's only a matter of time before we get something similar too.
What do you think?
-----
Laxoonz: Wasn't it common sense to think of Dante as a teenager?
-----
Hate: It was DMC4.
-----
Hate: Yes, I was a big fan of DMC3... and then you have Vergil and the new kid.
-----
Mikebison: Oh no.
-----
Noroi_Kisaragi: nope, it's been ages
-----
kennyamr: "Can't wait to see this artist's new artwork in the future"
-----
Hate: Not really, that's a new franchise.
-----
BriGuy: I mean, the Dante art is really good, just not what I was expecting from Devil May Cry. Dante's been a lot more polished in terms of art this generation. I mean, there's the Michael Jordan one (and he's not as polished as Dante either, but he's got some great talent in there), but I don't know if I like the art style of the game the way it looks now.

====================
~!~Suda51's Xanadu Next (possibly TGS) has been delayed to 2019

TheGamingNewsGuy: Gematsu has published an article saying that the game has been delayed to 2019. They said it was due to TGS not being in, announced that the game was not a part of TGS and the next TGS date isn't on the date that much of the game is.
More:
Full article here
-----
Jawmuncher: I hope the delay is a good sign. Being able to play the game before it is definitely a plus to me.
-----
cw_sasuke: It doesnt really matter.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yes but they need to delay it. The game is likely to release next year and the delay will be felt.
-----
ILikeFeet: I think this is a sensible move, especially considering how much money they were able to get from the original team
-----
Memento: I think it is more a matter of time now then ever
-----
Cantaim: I'm super excited for this game. I'd be interested to hear if it is being worked on after TGS.
-----
Tribal24: nice. hopefully the delay is just them getting rushed to hell.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I'm super excited to see what they do next. I think it'll be a matter of time now.

====================
~!~What are the best videos and gifs of all time?

TheFallenSaboteur: I have a long history with the internet and finding interesting videos, gifs and gifs of games I never got around to playing, all because I wanted to dive into the world of gaming so I can enjoy myself.
With the recent "best of zelda" thread and the recent "best video game" thread, I've been thinking about the best video game videos and gifs ever, ever, anywhere. I'm not even sure if this is thread-worthy enough to warrant a dedicated thread but I think I'd love to find more stuff like this.
Here are a few of my faves:
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Sleeping Dogs is probably my favorite in the series.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Don't lie. I love both of those games.
-----

TheFallenSaboteur: It's been a long time since I played them but Phantom Hourglass is easily my favorite. The animation, the story, the music, the gameplay, it was just pure gold.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Oops, right in the title. Can a mod move it?
-----

====================
~!~Steam v. Sony crossplay

Soundtrack2chaos: With the recent news about Sony skipping crossplay, crossplay seems to be the only way to win in online gaming.
I was looking up Sony’s account policies on crossplay and how it affects things. I was wondering what the policy on account blocking was, if it was the only way to win or was it all about the other things you have to do if you want crossplay to happen.
-----
ILikeFeet: well if you have crossplay, you don't need to play with people that don't play
-----
Kenzodielocke: Yeah, I don't think we will see it.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think it's a different discussion. Does the “win” or “lose” have to be any other way than it?
-----
Deleted member 43077: why is it crossplay only when it was the other?
-----
Kenzodielocke: You have to play with people that don‘t play.
-----
Tecnniqe: I think it's all about the people that use their consoles to play with PC players and the ones that don't.
-----
Bhonar: I don't think we'll see it, but I think you have a point with cross-platform play. I don't think it's as big of a deal as saying "PSN v. Sony cross-platform play." It's just that Sony has invested more in their ecosystem rather than competing for people to play with. Cross-platform play doesn't even exist in the "win" or "lose" situation.
Yes, Sony has invested more and more in the platform but they haven't really needed to improve.
-----
TailorDKS: I think if we see cross platform play and cross platform matchmaking with PC, it will change the current behaviour of the PC platform and how players are able to play with users from other platforms.
-----
Kylo Rey: We won't see it.
-----

====================
~!~Are all the Nintendo Switch games worth playing on their respective systems?

Memento: I am at work, so I just had a thought experiment, I am currently playing Splatoon 2 and RDR2 on my Switch and RDR2 is quickly consuming my free time.
I am kinda torn on it, I am not really interested in playing a new Nintendo system in my living room, but I am interested in trying it. Is there any recommendations for games that are worth playing or planning to play on my Switch?
-----
Jaded Alyx: Splatoon
-----
Memento: Shoot, thanks!
-----

====================
~!~What are the chances of a "Tomb Raider" game on the next Xbox?

Puggs: I have a lot of hope in this game. The series is known for having very strong sequels.
-----
Mazzle: I hope so too.
-----
WillySJ3: Yes.
-----
Caiusto: I'd love a Tomb Raider with the same style.
-----
Mondo: I hope so too. It's a franchise that if it doesn't grab your attention (or if it doesn't sell well because of its marketing), it doesn't do so well.
-----
Gundam: I'd rather see them do a reboot of the open world Tomb Raider formula.
-----
DarthWalden: I would love to see a reboot that goes back to one of the classic franchises but focuses on some new one.
-----
Cartridge Games: Sure, I’d love to see it. 
I’d also like a story reboot as well, potentially with a lot of Lara croft’s story being wrapped up with “what if” scenarios.
-----
Caiusto: I love that idea!
I would want to see Dino Crisis as well.
-----
CormoranStrike: Why not?
-----

Theorry: Most impressive video.

Izun: That was some beastly performance.

Theorry: Yes. And there is a thread on this already lol.

The Last One: Locked thread.

====================
~!~New Hitman 2 map released - South China Sea

Theorry: 
-----
That Naive Cube!!: I know it's just a small map but I'm interested in seeing more
-----
Theorry: It is the sea map.
-----
SuperPac: The map looks great. The sea looks lodded and drab. The summer sea looks much more promising.
-----
Klobrille: So the map is based on the summer island? That's pretty neat.
-----
Theorry: I believe its the same for the summer.
-----
Lonely1: It's based in the entire Sesaje range, not just seaside.
-----
Dphex: the summer sea is looking good, i hope there's a bigger zone
-----
Theorry: I believe its based in the same range.
-----
Theorry: I believe that it is based in the same range.

====================
~!~What would you want to see from a new Kingdom Hearts?

Araujo: So, after the recent reveal and discussion around Kingdom Hearts 3, it made me think about the current state of the series. And after a few posts, i decided to take a look at the current state of the series.
Back in 2015, Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the Nintendo Switch. Immediately, the game fell a bit of a thewalk. Not only because of the confusing history of the franchise with Disney, Square didn't want to go in that direction. And considering Nomura had previously stated that the franchise would never be re-developed (setting aside for a sequel), i didn't think that much of the baggageak
-----
Etrian Darkness: An updated KH engine would be nice. 
But then again, I don't mind if the engine is used in some form. It's a huge chunk worse than the PS3 version as far as I'm concerned. 
I'm probably in the minority, but I liked SE's reaction to the transition in 2015 with this.
-----
HeartlessNobody2134: I would love to see a new set of characters.
-----
Tibarn: I want a Kingdom Hearts aesthetic, with not too much of a world or storyline.
That being said I already love the look of the series. From 2015 is where it's at.
-----
Saitama: By the time KH3 comes out they have to go deep into the world and lore of the series
-----
KZXcellent: A new story, with no more complicated gameplay, would be nice.
-----
theofficefan99: I want the game to be as long- as KH1
-----
Araujo: It's honestly because the series doesn't need a big shake up in order to carry forward.
-----
Aokiji: Let’s get a new team, developers, and director. 
And a new world.
-----
KZXcellent: I'd love to see a new team. More stories, more keyblade wielders. Better level design and areas to explore.
-----

====================
~!~The "I can't be bothered to put my Switch down for 5 minutes" argument about the Switch doesn't hold up

Ex-Actarus: So I booted up my Switch today. We’re going to be having a long day so I decided to download the Mario Tennis Aces trial on the trial basket.
The point of this trial is so you can take your Switch on trial.com and you’ll be locked to the 25-30 hour range.
So you’ll have to play the game on trial.com if you want to unlock the ability to play the game offline.
This is a problem. The trial.com is not a place where you can play the game offline. You need to download the trial.com trial.com site to get access.
So you would be locked out of the game if you wanted to play the game offline.
I’m not a big fan of this type of trial. I’m a big fan of playing the game in its native time. However, I’m not sure if I could download a trial for the Switch today if I had just downloaded the trial.com site.
I’m sure the site is secure and encrypted and should not have this kind of issues. However, I’m still not sure about how long the trial will last.
What do you think?
-----
Dest: You'll be locked out if you need to play the game in its native time.
-----
Herb Alpert: I doubt the game is playable offline ...
-----
Zero-ELEC: You're locked out. You can't play the game.
-----
Jaded Alyx: You're locked out.
-----
Dyle: You can't play the game
-----
Phantom Thief: I'd be pretty confused if I had to download a trial to play the game offline even for "afternoon fun" jokes
-----
Tofer: Is it possible the cart is region free? I don’t think it uses a cart owned by Nintendo
-----
ubercheez: I have to download the trial.com site to play the game.
-----
Vivi: Seems like you should be able to download the trial.com site.

====================
~!~Should the OST soundtrack be kept forever?

werezompire: I've been playing games for the last year-and-a-bit and there has been a lot of discussion about whether ambient sound should be lost, lost, or retired.
I'm not saying that OSTs are inherently bad (they are just audiovisual), just that I think they should continue to be used and reused and expanded upon.
This is something that I think a lot of composers throughout history had a ton of experience with and personal taste into, and it seems like something that should be explored more.
I guess the point of this thread is to ask whether ambient sound can lose its impact, or stay relevant and persist throughout games.
What do you think? Is this a lost art? Do you think ambient sound can or should be made to go or go away? Do you think ambient sound can or should go away?
EDIT: Just in case, I'm commenting this because I think there's a lot of discussion on this and I think it's important to talk about it, especially in times where ambient sound is used more frequently.
-----
Pancho: This is a lost art.
-----
Svart: Lmao, it is a lost art.
-----
Mazzle: It is an extremely old art.
AC was an innovative genre and is remembered fondly for that, but since its inception, it has been at the center of much debate.
We don't know what the hell either. The dance and music is a relic of cinema and music form, it should be replaced by something else.
-----
vestan: It's an ancient art.
-----
TheStebe: I think it works best when used uniquely for immersion.
However I think ambient sounds need to go back to being about noises in your head.
Resident Evil (2004) for example is used as a sort of example of what would be considered to be alien music form the video industry.
-----
Daffy Duck: I think it’s a lost art.
It’s an old song but it still plays and looks alien.
-----
Nakenorm: What? Never realized that this is even a topic.
-----
Zephyriel: I think it's an old song.
-----
vestan: Yep, I'm just remembering this fondly
====================
~!~What's your favorite game abbreviation?

TheSubsequentStrajack: Now that we're more than two months past the Switch's launch and E3 time, it's time for time to reflect on all the letters that have been used across all my games. What's yours?
-----
Cartridge Games: Bulletstorm. 
Genuinely thought it was Gungham.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I guess I could see this being used for Genocyubus to make it sound more confusing.
-----
vestan: Does this mean Dino Crisis too?
-----
Mauricio_Magus: The most important one is probably Bulletstorm.
-----
THE GUY: Not sure if this counts.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I mean, it's a "who outside of that name is gungham" situation
-----
Sgt. Demblant: R.I.P. Me.
-----
get2sammyb: I'm gonna say Resident Evil. Because I think it is the most iconic and iconic naming scheme of all time.

~!~Is there any way to get a new mouse modded mouse?

Slythe: My old Razer Corsair mechanical is still kicking and screaming Arma 3.
I'm looking to upgrade my mechanical and am looking to get something just to try and get a mouse with better DPI scaling.
Is there any way to do that effectively.
-----
Sloppyjoe_Gamer: There is.
-----
D65: I just bought a mechanical keyboard
-----
LewieP: Yes, it's the blue one.

CormoranStrike: Here's the thread I made on it.

SliChillax: I'm looking into this

~!~SEGA announces Sonic Mania Plus for Switch

Hero of Legend: Well, that's it.
Just a heads up, the Plus is priced at $40.
Here's the official description which includes a banner:
So, yes, here's the official announcement of the Plus.
-----
Eolz: That's an odd deal, I wonder what the price is going to be.
-----
Svart: Oh, that's neat.
I like their descriptions about the Plus, and hopefully they will release it on day 1.
-----
Hero of Legend: Yeah, it's probably $40.
-----
Lumination: I'm going to have to check that. I guess I can wait.
-----
daxy: I've heard some horror stories about the plus, but maybe this is just me. I wonder if anything happened.
-----
Tregard: Finally, if I can't wait to buy this game, I'll go back and play it on the PC.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Cool, but where is the release date?
-----
Svart: And can you toggle the "add to cart" button on the title bar so I can buy the game on my own account.
-----

====================
~!~Vanillaware announces Anima and Left Alive for Switch, out in JP on January 17

Hero of Legend: This is from Gematsu.
Leaves Alive, if you haven't heard of this game, is a gauntlet of mech games that focus on multiplayer battling and involves the player using a mech to protect themselves from enemy attacks. It's also mentioned that it is a bit fucking hard but it'll do the job.
I'm interested in what's out.
-----
Vimes: Sounds like Left Alive.
-----
Hero of Legend: It's been on my radar for a while. Now I'm glad to see it's finally coming out. Left Alive was bad and basically just started on PC (though Left Alive had a really good port for 360).
-----
Comic Obsessed: Left Alive is the closest to 2019.
I have no idea why Switch gamers keep mentioning this game when it should be an ideal one for people who are interested in mech games but haven't gotten to that before.
-----
Flutter: Almost sounds like a Left Alive situation.
Looks interesting though.
-----
Kaguya: There is already a thread for this. 
I am not interested in Left Alive.
-----
Mugman: The game looks pretty interesting, it seems like a very intense mech game, and I'm on board for the future of this. I love me some Left Alive.
-----
Warrior: looks pretty good, mech games aren't new genre though and the ones that are are more hype
-----
Comic Obsessed: Yeah, I know. I will admit though, I don't enjoy mech games at all. I like mech mostly because I like the freedom to go insane and use everything I find within it (weapons, armor, weaknesses, moves, etc.). The gameplay is a bit simple but the components all run together and you don't need to rely on a guide/raunch-around-a-plow just to have a good time.
-----

====================
~!~New Samurai Showdown Gameplay footage

g23: Looks awesome, hopefully we get more info soon.
-----
Sir Guts: It’s finally happening!
-----
Gegz: Awesome, love your work Cap!
-----
Kalentan: I'm excited.
-----
Pog: It looks like the first real trailer.
-----
Gegz: Well, that's one way to put it :D
-----
Gegz: I am not excited for this game, but I am excited enough for the game to be playable.
-----
Razgriz417: it's looking GREAT. Anyone know when the gameplay kicks off? I'm not a fan of the way customization looks, but it looks like it'll be fun.
-----
Razgriz417: hope it comes out this year, but i'm sure game won't drop out very soon anyway

====================
~!~How has the Switch's online community been doing for more than a decade?

Camstun187: Been playing the SPLAmore Megalovania’s online for the first time in years.
It’s so good. There’s a healthy amount of competition, even if you just started, and the community has been steadily growing over time.
This is my first time playing a Mario Kart online game and I started to play online.
Is there anything I should know?
-----
Jayson's Rage: I'd say it's been pretty solid. I had to Google the specific complaint and saw it passed.
-----
HStallion: That's true but I guess it's not that hard to find them otherwise.
-----
Mazzle: I've only played the second game for about a year but I heard it's pretty good.
-----
Camstun187: This has been my go to game to play on my Switch.
I love online, but I've never been this competitive with people online.
I guess I’m not playing this right now lol
-----
Erdnaut: It's been good. It's been a lot better than I thought it would be, but I still haven't started with it yet.
-----
RavenH2: I started playing it this weekend and have no clue how it is but it is fun.
-----
Camstun187: I’m planning on starting Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, but I could only get one game in the game before that.
-----
hotcyder: I enjoy it when things go wrong

~!~What to expect from the next AC in the Unity engine

SG-17: I'm playing Origins on my Switch and it's looking like a game I'm going to go back to. I'm wondering what it looks like to play with the engine that was used for the Syndicate and Origins runs.
My assumption is that it will be a more RPG structure where you can create a character with a specific skill set and be able to progress while doing so. I don't think it will be cel shaded, but I think it will look a bit more cel-shaded than Origins, maybe just a tad more.
What do you think?
-----
galv: I hope this means the story will be a lot more interesting. I haven't played Origins, but to me it felt a lot more like a Bioware game than something from Ubi, so that seems very unlikely.
-----
SG-17: I'm not sure what the gameplay is like. It seems like it will be a strategy based game.
-----
Blade Wolf: I think it looks ok, but I know I'm going to be turned off by something else.
-----
Fork: Unity is a horrible engine. Ubi could have made it what they wanted to work on, but Unity just shows such a rudimentary level of design that I can't imagine them working on something even deeper. It's crazy.
I really hope that team is working on a new engine now. The last time they were willing to commit to a new engine was Unity, which was trash. Unity is incredibly incapable of making bare bones-looking functional games anymore.
-----
zombiejames: My guess is it'll have some sort of epic story mode.
-----
texhnolyze: I want it to be a mix of RPGs and CRPGs. I guess they are really trying for a CRPG experience.
Combat should be turn based. I don't think I'll be able to finish it.
The building should be turn based. I don't think I can even imagine what they have been up to in this engine.
Story mode sounds fun. Maybe it will be like the Ghost Recon game.
-----
robotrock: This is the one thing I hope Ubisoft will take notes on
-----
PopsMaellard: Unity is a horrible engine. 
Really? What's the point of doing this if they're going
====================
~!~What is the easiest way to beat the final boss in Dark Souls?

Horse Armour: I've been playing Dark Souls for a very long time and I found it very easy to hit the final boss with the Axeslinger in the Undead section of Dark Souls 3.
There are a few short, easy ways to beat this boss, but I'd recommend just using the easiest method and just run around the area.
-----
Etrian Darkness: Well, that's how I like to go a bit further with the thread. No rings required, no run to ring to ring.
-----

~!~What is the best way to play all of these Final Fantasy games?

Usyren: I've read about the collection and DQ11 is the best way to play these games but what's the best way to play these games? I've played the first one, and I'm enjoying it. Any tips or general advice would be appreciated.

NeoZeedeater: I recommend having at least one other player do the asking:

More_Badass: ​Developer: ActRaiser
Publisher: Konami
Release Date: July 26th, 2018
Platforms: PlayStation 4
Genre: Action
-----
Tohsaka: I'm hoping this turns out well for them. I didn't know Yoshichan had a developed a following back in the day.
-----
Dullahan: I got this after waiting for nearly a year for it. I've been waiting for 6 months to get this.
-----
Jim_Cacher: Thanks for the heads up!
-----
Thuddert: Hopped on this, glad it's coming so soon.
-----
Algorum: Not a bad game, I still feel it has a weak spot but I like the overall concept more than ActRaiser.
-----
tiesto: Is this a sequel to Yoshichan? I own it on Steam but never played it.
-----
Lunchbox: Finally! This is the type of game I want to play on my Nintendo Switch...

Ametroid: The Switch version was announced yesterday? It was on sale at the beginning of the month for $20, how did it fare?

~!~Riot Games is teasing their newest game, Riot Games is teasing their newest game, Riot Games is teasing their newest game, Riot Games is teasing their newest game.

JEH: They just tweeted this.
-----
Fat4all: we are in dire need of better goddamn birthdays
-----
Frozenprince: We need dem birthdays too.
-----
KORNdog: I hope that will be Riot's game.
-----
JINX: So it's about time.
-----
Cinemikel: Sure they gotta make a fucking new game
-----

JEH: It was kind of their MO.
-----
Ebtesam: That is gonna be weird when the dev for Riot start's project in less than a year

KORNdog: i mean, the question is, how hard can someone convince a publisher not to lock down Riot for another 2-3 years, if you can't even play their games?

~!~I would like to hear some Story/Characters from the Trails games and if they are in this game should be let's play

Dreamboum: I was thinking about the same thing and I've seen a lot of comments saying they would rather hear from fans of the Trails series if they are in this game and if they are from the Trails series they should be let's play. I was thinking about the same thing but to a lesser extent.
I mean I would love to hear about the adventure games of this series.
-----
Coolsambob: I would really like to hear a Story of a Tale of a Tail.
-----
Dreamboum: That's a good idea to be sure, I'm still waiting for a good story of a game
-----
Dreamboum: I've been hoping for a story of a game for a while. 
I agree on that. I think a lot of people would enjoy a story of a game in a way that Trails no doubt has.

~!~What are some good solid God of War DLC?

Wololo for the love of god send me to the new zone 1. What are some good DLC for the new game?
-----
hydruxo: The DLC for GoW was really good.
My guess is that they are waiting for people to create the level they want it to be and then some.
-----
Brix: I’d say that is the best part of the game. The new area is insane and the new enemies are a bit to hard fights.
-----
HeisenbergWW62: It’s a great god of war 4 zone
-----
Flux: It's better than any of the previous 4 but it's not as good as the 3DS GoW's so it's not as good as it could be.
-----
Theorry: I mean that is the only one of the GOWs that isn't DLC.
-----
Nakenorm: I preferred GoW 3 & 4. I didn't really like GoW 1, it was just unplayable for me.
-----
Sleeping Lesson: It's definitely better than the 3 and 4. I'd say it's a better overall experience.
-----
Manu: It's not even a super zone, it's a mix between zones with a bit more focus on puzzles and some smaller smaller encounters.

~!~The best part of Dark Souls?

SofNascimento: One of the best parts of Dark Souls is the dialogue. From what little I played of The Ring I can tell it's just not the best part of the game. I really like it but it's not the most important thing in the game.
So I'm curious, what are your favorite parts of Dark Souls? Are there any which are least important? Did you enjoy them and if so, what parts do you like about them?
-----
Legitmcfalls: Story is actually really good.
-----
Viale: Personally I think I like the dialogue in the game the most. It really helps flesh out the world, and its the most satisfying to go through and find all the little secrets.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: The Ring of Favor is really useful in the quest chains. It helps flesh out the lore and allows the player to become more familiar with the lore. I always thought it was a bit clunky to make a ring that you had to get through in Demon's but it's not that much harder since you can place it between bonfire slots.
-----
Skab: The Ring and NPCs.
-----
Buckle: The Ring gives you the most important part of the game.
The best part is when you can actually interact with the Ring.
-----
Jasbasse: The Ring is the real deal.
The best part of the game is the dialogue.
-----
Spring-Loaded: Wrong thread

====================
~!~Games with great dialog

Pankratous: With most games I know the names of the areas/characters and go through the story and explain the story sections. But what about the dialogue?
I'm talking about dialog in games.
I know I can't be bothered to explain anything. I have to watch the cutscenes. I have to wait 5 minutes to enter the room. I have to watch the cutscenes. I have to walk across the room. I have to listen to the audio logs. I have to read the plot summary. I have to sit down. I have to use my hands. I have to get the most out of the computer equipment. I am not allowed to go into any unlocked room. I am not allowed to skip dialogue. I am not allowed to see the cutscenes. I am not allowed to skip the explanation or the summary of the plot section.
I can think of a few games where this is allowed:
Senran Kagura
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
and
Phantasy Star: Orcs Must Die
-----
TheMoon: You mean the first? Might use it in the second example, but I doubt it would spoil the surprises in those.
-----
Aters: You've already played the second game OP. Might as well check it out.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’d put it in the first example, but the second game is still a good time. It’s worth catching up on the previous games.
-----
leng jai: The answer is yes, it's just that the first is not a good time in the first place.
-----
Phantom Thief: And the answer is even worse
-----
Thorn: When you play Persona 4...
-----
Phantom Thief: Persona 3 is the best Persona and or Dragon Quest game.
-----
Phantom Thief: Persona 4 was released in 2008.
-----
KrigareN-: The answer is actually Phantasy Star IV.

====================
~!~Nintendo recently added the "Online Networking Service" to the Switch OS

GhostTrick: I always like to use the online network when I play games that just don't have a good connection I always have game invites in a box and is sometimes waiting til a friend calls or something.
But i never have the time to use the service in order to play a game such as Smash Brothers.
But this update is a huge game changer and allows us to use the network in order to play those games.
I tried going to play Mario Kart with the family and we got a lot of invites from people not even playing Smash.
I wanted to use the services but it only let me play on the Switch.
I can use the Nintendo online service now and I'm using it for the first time ever with some games.
I really want to use this service in order to play my games some damn time, and even more I just want to play some games.
So, let me know what you think about this update.
-----
yuoke: I never use the online network. It's pretty pointless and doesn't help.
-----
hibikase: Shouldn’t be, I think it’s annoying as hell.
-----
jorgejjvr: Best thing is to use the classic share feature and still get invites from people who already have the same network
-----
Pokemaniac: No, I don't have a Nintendo Switch.
-----
TrickyAssist: The only thing I've ever done I've used the Nintendo Network Services was the NES app on my Xbox and had the best experience using the NES app on PS4.
-----
Chauzu: I've used the NES app on PS4, but I don't think I ever used the online network. I only need to use the services to play online, like eShop, the PSN, and the Nintendo Online Service.
I don't think I've used the online network in a long time, but I do remember feeling bad when I tried out Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and a friend just called me saying he had cloud saves showing. I think it was Mario Kart 8 deluxe de Blob or Switch Online, but I know there was Mario Kart 7 deluxe and 8.

Barely Able: No, I can still use the NNID and still be prompted to download a mod to

Ubisoft Spain recently started a press conference for the game, with the game director and producer calling it the most important Assassin's Creed since Revelations. 
Ubisoft is currently teasing the announcement for a livestream about the game on their social channels. 
An hour and 18 minutes left til the announcement, and it is already looking like they are preparing for this. 
Ubisoft is currently teasing the release date for the game on their social channels.

Gbraga: Ubisoft has been teasing it too a long time ago, I think.

====================
~!~I'm thinking of playing a Gamecube-made. What are?

malyse: My first experience with the Gamecube was with Jurassic Park. I don't know how much longer I can keep playing it, but I'm looking to play a game that either requires a very long amount of motion control, or a tight control method.
I'm looking to play something that is both a puzzle and a platformer. It's kind of up to the user what they feel they need to do to remain as precise as possible in moving about. I'm looking to play something designed around those two things.
I've tried:
Metal Gear Solid 2. I remember playing this at my friend's place and not finding it very interesting.
Metal Gear Solid 2 is one of those games where the combat is one of the most complex things I've ever experienced in a game. I had to have a Wii, which had motion controls, which meant I had to learn the inputs to be in the correct place. I didn't though. The tutorial was a huge tutorial. It's a platformer. I didn't get to beat it.
Metal Gear Solid 3 is a game where survival is the main focus. I was intrigued by the stealth mechanics, but I didn't like the characters. The early game is rough. It's a bit more polished than MGS3.
Super Mario 64 was another one I tried with a friend. I remember playing this early and enjoying it more than I remembered.
I have a few ideas I'd like to explore along with:
SimCity was one of the first 3D games to implement physics into the design. Physics were implemented to make it appear that the world was moving at half the speed. The effect was subtle, but so effective. I'd like to see what Streets of Rage 4 could do, and maybe that's me.
Metal Gear Solid 1 was 3rd Strike's first attempt at time of port. It was a fun time. The story was interesting, and the story had a lot of heart. I'd like to see what Streets of Rage 5 could do.
-----
Vroad: World of Warcraft was the first game from Blizzard that had “Children of Mortos in it!”
-----
Phantom Thief: This is an OT, so don’t post threads that include “Fuck yeah, I want to play STALKER!!!”
-----

====================
~!~Is there an essential or essential Splinter Cell game?

chaobreaker: I mean, I'm sure there are some clones of the Chaos Theory games out there, but I just have to wager it's one of the best, if not the best, of the series.
I know it's not the best game in the series yet, but I feel like there's a place for it somewhere.
-----
the7egend: I recommend Blacklist.
It's a stealth tactical shooter with modern stealth mechanics and has a great storyline.
-----
Iva Demilcol: Is GalTrend 4?
-----
Neptonic: Splinter Cell Blacklist is one of the best Call of Duty games ever if you want to play like a true Blacklist fan
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: I'd go with Conviction.
It's available on PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and Xbox One.
-----
Falchion: I think you should play Blacklist but I think Conviction is excellent.
-----
Freddo: For the most part Blacklist is okay, but not by much.
-----
Rhaknar: good call of dhow
-----
weblaus: I'm waiting for a sale on Blacklist, I'm waiting for a sale on Blacklist 2.

====================
~!~The Switch Era, how do we feel about the Switch now?

TheDanger: With all the talk about the death of the Wii U and now the rumors of a Switch revision, I wanted to know from a Nintendo(EU) community perspective, how the Switch is doing.
First off, I'd like to acknowledge the following people:
Yasumi Matsuno(Director of all games)
Is it too late to make a sequel to the fantastic Game Boy Player?
Is it too late to release the Gamecube Controller?
Is it too reversible into the classic Gamecube?
Are there any controller ports coming to the Switch?
And finally, I'd like to hear from the people within the dev team, how is the Switch now, and what are some of your expectations, if you see something approaching a Switch renaissance?
-----
KZXcellent: I'm expecting a Switch Proton port.
-----
Razgriz417: considering the state of the game right now, I'm not really expecting a lot. The 3DS allowed a lot of experimentation, but the Switch really isn't one of those devices where you can have a system that can play games anywhere. If something catches on the 3DS, expect a lot more classic ports.
-----
Phantom Thief: They've never made a port of the 3DS anywhere near enough, and they've also never released a new port of the Game Boy Player.
-----
TheDanger: Well, I mean if they're going to make a Switch Proton port, I'd expect it to be a big time hit.
-----
TheDanger: ohhhhh i missed it, thanks
-----
'3y Kingdom: It's not out yet, so it's probably too far in.
-----
Cryptosporidium: I think that's the kinda situation where they're not really in a position to answer when it comes to a revision.
They've said numerous times that they're doing a revision and it's not ready yet. 
I think we're going to see games like Wolfenstein 2 that are enhanced on switch.
-----
TheDanger: well, I mean right now the only way we can play the same games as the 3ds games is through homebrew at some point in time.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don't think that's the case.
-----

====================
~!~The crown jewel of DS games comes to mind

Poshi: I thought it would be cool if some of you also took away any preconceived notions about the DS's jewel case/book cases.
I think it is super neat to have a game that you were unsure of what you would like to play, but you are now playing. It is a wonderful feeling when you see what you were going to enjoy the most, and you get to see it again.
For me it is the DS Lite. I loved it when I first saw it, and was so happy when I finally got to play it, and so happy I finally got to play DS 3. I was so ready to go back to it, it felt soo good playing it, and it would have been a lot more enjoyable if I had something to control the camera and make me feel like I was playing a real DS game again.
It is a brilliant device. It is a portable device in a world where Nintendo can sometimes feel their portable devices are too restrictive. It is perfect for a backstop for developers to stray into genres they don't want you to do, and it is also a great device to play a game that had previously been played in a handheld mode.
It is a great device, and an amazing example of what a small handheld can do.
It is a little expensive now, but if you can afford it, it is a really nice device for anyone looking for a portable device to play in a living room setup.
What about you? Do you like the DS? What are some of your favorite DS games?
-----
Cartridge Games: I think I’m gonna mention Rhythm Paradise for the second time it came out.
Wondering if they’ll ever make a new DS game. Has a demo been released so far. Don’t remember the last one
-----
Exellus: Me too. I remember liking the DS and the idea of the 2nd screen.
-----
Poshi: That's a pretty good idea! I actually have never played the 2nd game so I would really appreciate a sequel to the DS one.
-----
CaviarMeths: I love the DS, but I still prefer the DS Lite, I think. I know I'm in the minority, but I really like the DS and it's a great handheld that's been getting better and better.

~!~The Xbox One X S is like a Condor, but more powerful. What do you get out of Xbox One X S?

Robinson: If you can, for the most part, get a One X from Newegg for $199.
What do you get out of the console?
-----
Starlatine: "this time" is more like "I wish I had a 4k tv that could last for years"
-----
d9b: You can also get a 4k Blu-Ray player.
-----
DionardoLicaprio: It's not an X-1, it's a S.
-----
Daffy Duck: I think the price is right, it's the best console of the gen imo.
-----
Robinson: It's a great console, but I've bought it twice already.
-----
10k: You can get a Blu-ray player, but it's more expensive than a PS4.
-----
Lokoline: I would say the best console this gen for you
-----
Josh5890: How well does it run?
-----
dancingphlower: It's a great console, but the price is what I want.

~!~Should I play Devil May Cry 1 to 3 before DMCV?

Crazy Izanagi: So I’m getting back into DMC and it’s been a fantastic experience. I have played through every DMC and IV game and even the first one.
However I’m specifically asking if I should play DMC3 first before DMCV. I’m currently in the middle of a campaign and it’s just such a slog to get through it.
I’d rather be informed then tell you if you even want to bother.
-----
Theswweet: 3 is a better game than 2, but 3 has better music.
-----
UnluckyKate: They're very different damn good action games full stop
-----
Crazy Izanagi: It’s funny. I’m very used to DMCs music so I just listen to DMC1 tracks in the background.
-----
Gattsu25: I just want to say this game is a lot of fun.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: If you’re getting into DMCV, I would suggest you get DmC instead.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: Lol no. I feel like this topic isn’t really worth the thread.
-----
Jawmuncher: I don’t think it makes much difference. 
DmC is more a different experience than 2.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I feel like that’s what people would want to hear in those games.
-----
Nocturnowl: Its 2 has better music though.

====================
~!~What are your favourite and least favourite Nintendo home ports?

Gartooth: I've been replaying Donkey Kong Country 2 for the first time in years (I think it was Super Mario Galaxy?) and it’s actually one of my favourite games ever. It’s got a cult following and a very distinct arcade feel to it that is distinctly oppressive. The music is outstanding and so is the gameplay.
My favourite rendition of the game is probably the port of the original, which I haven’t played or even seen re-playing. I think it may be a little overdone if you prefer their other arrangements.
HOLY SHIT is a little more on the sweet side. The original version has some great extras that add up nicely. The remixes of DKC2 songs are also really good.
I know that some people don’t like the port of Donkey Kong but if you like to play on that platform, you really should.
-----
BiohunterX: I love them all but imo they are all over the place
-----
Lwill: I forget a lot of them. But I actually really like the port of the original. It has some great bonus beat-em-ups along with some cool bonus mini bonus games.
-----
Crayon: I like them all, but they are short and pretty short.
-----
Noppie: I remember playing the original on the Game Boy in the late 90s, it was really good.
-----
Mondo: Donkey Kong '94 is a must play, it's a great port.
-----
Mugman: I've always liked the port of Super Mario 64 more than I remember, I just played through it last month and it's such an amazing game, the actual GB version is great and the four player co-op is awesome. I love the soundtrack by the same composer as the original game too!
-----
BroODawn: They are all great. The original is the better port, though the GBA/N64 one is much more refined.
-----
brokeastronaut: I remember being obsessed with the original Donkey Kong. Still do.
-----
banter: I prefer the original version. I like the bosses more however.

====================
~!~RTTP: Candleman - A 2D Platformer in the Candru

Dusk Golem: So I've been playing Candleman in a new indie, and I'm really enjoying it.
I've had this game in my Steam wishlist for ages, and it's stuck in my backlog. They have a bunch of cool indie stuff like this on the steam page, but I've never heard of this game or its creators before.
The trailer looks great, in the original release, and the music is so good. I think this is one of the best platformers of the past decade.
(I may have spoiled it, but I haven't played any of the Amnesia games, so I haven't followed this one very much)
I've been really impressed with the way the pixel art style allows Candleman to feel alive, and the music, and the overall animation is really good. The pixel art on the trailer is very charming, and the atmosphere and the music, is a really clever mechanic.
I'm very curious about what they have planned for the sequel, but I feel I should wait for further reviews, and I'm not sure I'll get a game like this.
I would really like to get a sequel in the vein of Night in the Woods, but I guess I'm not getting one.
I have a few more thoughts and collect this is interesting to me, and am really looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us.
-----
Khanimus: Ooh I'm in. 
It's a shame Amnesia and The House in Fata Morgana aren't on sale yet, but this might be the first one for sure.
-----
Dusk Golem: Yeah it's really a shame Night in the Woods doesn't seem to be on sale at all. I've been wanting to play some good platformers for a long time, but haven't had the time to play them all.
I'll be double dipping in if they go full Metroidvania, though I prefer Hollow Knight.
-----
Dreamboum: Worth it for the beautiful music. The pixel art is much more striking than I expected from Astro Boy and other similar games.
-----
Lumination: I really liked it. The visuals are really good. I think it's a little rough around the edges, but I think the level design is really good and the music is very good too.
====================
~!~Why is the Steam beta so expensive?

SantaC: I have been interested in Steam since the beta and chose the best of the best because it is the best.
I am wondering why there is so much money spent when the beta is almost over.
-----
TheUnseenTheUnheard: Because competition
-----
Biestmann: I think it's because the games are rarely on sale.
-----
SantaC: The games are rarely on sale so competition is way more important.
-----
Bishop89: because competition!
-----
Mesoian: It's because competition is bad for the endgame
-----
Bishop89: there was no "lootbox" in the beta
-----
Ryo Hazuki: I liked the beta because it was a good test of all the various launchers I could use. I liked the "limited" options. I liked the beta. It was a really good test of what a game should be, and not just what it needed to happen. The game is great, if it has depth.
-----
Noisepurge: because competition.

MomoVideo: Everyone does.

~!~Are there any other good mobile games?

Revolsin: My only memory of mobile gaming is doing one shit I wish I could play in a living room.
For the past few months I've been going through my iPad and messing around with Fortnite and Act 2. I really don't know what this is but I can definitely see it as a good game to play in small group sessions.
I've really been getting my fill of Fortnite and it's a really fun game to mess around with. I think the better answer is probably something like Pokemon Let's Go but that's hard to remember since I've never played one myself.
Are there any other good mobile games worth playing?
-----
Aaron D.: Slime Rancher.
It's a classic.
-----
Rune Corp: I don't know, but you're right, it's a great game.
-----
Grapezard: I remember playing it like a few months ago, back when it was still relatively easy to find a group to hang play it with.
-----
Theolant: Pretty much a lot of the mobile games seem to be like that, where you can play with friends, or even "party games" in general. The only other decent one I can think of is Slay the Spire, but I haven't played that much once I got a job.
-----
Kouriozan: I remember playing it with friends a few months ago, it's pretty much like Pokemon Go with all the cute stuff.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I remember being surprised by it, I didnt think it was that good back when I played it. But I found a group to play with and got addicted.
That's when I found the game after a few friends played it and I fell in love with it.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I think you're pretty far on it. I had a few matches where I was playing for around 5 minutes talking to the people playing, not a lot but I had a pretty good time with a group of people anyway and had a blast. Just when I was starting to feel the hype of the mobile game, I was reminded that it was still a really big deal.

I think Revelations 2 might actually hold up, with the far better story (though it's not quite as big a deal as someone like me wanting to say Resident Evil 7 on this), tons of weapon variety, and arguably more than the other RE games, so much variation in the enemy and boss variety of sorts that was great to try and keep going back and forth between 1 and 2. But it's not enough.
Still, it's still a great game, and it still holds up amazingly well.

~!~How do you feel about the idea of a new comfy Pokemon game?

Porygon: I'm finally getting back into Pokemon and I love Hoenn. I liked the first 151 but I found it a little tedious to go through the story and GF is jealous of my partner for taking me out.
I've been thinking about a Pokemon new game for a while. I think the idea of being a 'newcomer' to Hoenn or Sinnoh and wanting to play with the 'catching mechanics', is a good one. 
I feel like the story has a lot going for it and I feel like the new comers can be a good addition to the group of new comers. It's hard to explain as I'm a bit of a purist and word gets around that trainers fight in the pokemon park are a bit tough, but if that's a deal breaker I'll take it. 
I'm not going for a new main character, but I'm still sceptical I will succeed. 
How do you feel about the idea?
-----
Kinsei: I really don't feel it. I mean I like the 'catch and throw' systems, and I think it's great they're taking things bits more seriously while not completely alienating anyone.
For starters, the catching mechanics aren't really that important to most people. They're just for that rare throw.
-----
Pikacookie: I really like it but it's really just a new pokemon. I find it a nice change of pace and I like the fact I'm not a total newcomer anymore.
Also, I think the story and world is great. It's not very long but definitely worth playing.
-----
808s & Villainy: There's a lot of things that I don't like about the game? I like the main story and figuring out the characters via the games history, and the novelty of being a new comer. It is just a different gen, and the main characters are just a throwaway thing for the most part.
-----
Lichtsang: I feel like it's a little tedious to play, even though I agree that the catching mechanics are a bit tedious.
-----
Vena: I agree. I love everything in the game, and I think it's one of the best Pokemon games I've ever played. It's charming, joyful, and fun, and I love the

~!~Has anyone else lost interest in the Kingdom Hearts series due to lack of story content?

TheGamingNewsGuy: I think the new KHIII on the Switch has a lot of story content but I can't get into the gameplay because I'm not invested in the Disney worlds. However, I do enjoy the Disney worlds, but I'm not a huge fan of the gameplay of the Kingdom Hearts games.
Recently finished the original on PS3, and it's been on sale a few times for 20€. I think it's time to go back to the games and finish them.
I think the mobile game was fun enough but I don't know if the story content or gameplay will appeal to me at all.
-----
ryushe: I mean, I'm not a fan of the KH games.
-----
DontHateTheBacon: I mean, it's fun. It's not a series I'm particularly interested in, but it's not something I'm holding on for 100 percent.
-----
jrush64: I really liked the mobile game but I never played the original on PS3. I want a true follow up.
-----
Kapryov: I have a soft spot for the series but KH has been holding my attention for so long and it's never been more obvious it could get bad reviews.
Edit:
Hoping for a true follow up.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m not sure how to feel about this.
KHIII for me is a more story-focused game than most of the KH games are, and it’s not the story that I have more or less lost interest in.
-----
Bishop89: I played the mobile game back when it first came out. Got about 10-15 hours into it and couldnt find the story. 
Then they made a 100% exclusive KH3 trailer. I was pretty excited but then the price of the game + I was already old and didn’t have enough money to jump in.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: How do you pay for the content? Do you just unlock stuff?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Just pay 20$ for the mobile version 
If it's free stuff you get it as part of the sale 
The price is the content

Phantom Thief: Yeah, I don’t mind the content that
====================
~!~Let's talk about indie game 'safe bets'.

Cinemikel: Ok let's get this out of the way, indie game 'safe bets,' or the term for what we tend to forget and gloss over in forums like this.
Ok, so I'll start off with a few reasons why I think this is a good idea.
First, we're talking about the first third of the game, which is a prologue to a new game. This is a prologue to a new game, where we'll see the protagonist of the game go beyond the main adventure.
This opens up the map of the game, giving us a unique perspective on the protagonist of a small, indie game. This opens up the rest of the game to a completely new scenario, where the main character is a character in a medieval setting.
This is a lot more of a positive pull than the DLC being free. It opens up things up, gives new adventures and feels more like a complete product.
Now, before we get into the problem of this, let me get this out of the way. The reason I'm going to talk about safe bets is because I'll be using the term 'safe' a lot. A safe bet is a definite reward. If a developer is willing to fund a game, it's usually a small amount over a long period of time. If a developer is not willing to fund a game, it's usually a small amount over a long period of time. This means that they can focus a lot of attention on the positives of the project, while still giving a good indication of the overall vision and vision of the game.
The first positive example I'll mention is 'a lot of the stuff in this game is going to piss people off'. I'm talking about a lot of people not liking the direction of the game. These are my personal examples:
Mass Effect 3 had a lot of fans not liking the 3rd entry. It had a lot of them not liking the second entry. That's pretty common with a lot of games that have been divisive amongst fans, including games like Fallout 76.
The new God of War for God of War, introduced a lot of 'hype babies' which were the reviewers who kept giving it the same criticism.
The new God of War, in its fourth entry, also brought a lot of 'big shoes to fill' which some reviewers still don't know about. The new

~!~I'm a big fan of the DS and its soft blue screens

*Guaraná: For some reason, the DS has some soft screens that look like PS1 games.
I was wondering if there are any DS games with soft screens that you would like to use as an example.

~!~The Surge 2’s Content Update Will Include a Character Set-Up for Switch

Atheerios: From the AMA
The Surge 2 is coming to Switch and we have only known about the release date now that it’s been revealed for Summer. So with that, it’s safe to assume that this content update will be coming to all platforms.
-----
Eolz: I wonder what they're thinking with this.
-----
DeSolos: 
-----
Ge0force: I'll gladly take a new Character if this game is good.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m actually interested in this game, but the lack of a character set-up for Switch really bummed me out. I love the Surge, and this seems to be the first time since the first game that a new set-up for Switch has felt like there was going to be a new Surge game.
-----
TangoAlphaLima: I'm really interested in it, but I'm worried it will be a generic rogue-like with a few melee characters. I love the first game, but the lack of a set-up for Switch really bummed me out.
-----
Ja-: I'm hoping for a "sprite-type" action game, but I don't think that's a stretch at all?
-----
Jaded Alyx: You say that, and I agree.
-----
Cave Story: I was really excited to hear that it was coming to Switch. I love the Surge.
-----
Piston: I really hope it's a new adventure game.

====================
~!~Why don't more games handle dynamic frame rates like the NES and SNES?

phanphare: I'm playing Red Steel on the Switch and it has pretty good frame rates. It's not perfect but it's pretty decent and the frame rate counter is sort of correct, which I'd like if I'm playing in handheld mode, but it's not. Do you think more developers are making the same mistake with the NES/SNES? I know the 30fps is a little annoying, but it's not really a deal breaker for me so I don't think it's a deal breaker.
Also with the 30fps counter being the same as the 30fps counter for NES and SNES and I'm playing in handheld mode, is that maybe just me? I know some people on the NES/SNES enthusiast forums are not crazy about this. I know some people on the SNES/NES classic subreddit are not crazy about this either. I know some people on the NES/SNES Classic Era are not crazy about this either. I know some people on the NES/SNES Classic Era are saying "oh, I have to play handheld mode" and they're not really saying that because they have the same 30fps like many of you do.
I'd like to see more games do this.
-----
Error 52: It's kind of weird to say that because the NES and SNES are the best in their class and the frame rates are reasonable for a genre that isn't particularly demanding.
But yeah, it's weird.
-----
lobdale: I mean if you want to play a game in a very high frame rate you gotta have good pacing. There's really no way a game can juggle 30fps well which is why it's so shocking to me.
-----
convo: It's weird because you think that the NES/SNES got a bad rep by their very existence, but the latest nes/esco games (and the recently released pikmin) have pretty good frame rates (albeit slightly worse than the NES/SNES)
-----
wbloop: It's weird. You can just buy a cheap 60FPS NES and buy it in the console store. You can buy a cheap SNES and buy it in the console store. You can turn it on your PC via the Windows game launcher.

~!~I’m concerned about the state of Switch online

*Guaraná: So, I have a problem in my life: I am worried about the state of Switch online.
I have two things in common with other consoles:
I have high Internet connection
I have a lot of other game consoles so I have to wait a few days for the mail or the update
I don’t play online and I like to be connected to my friends but I’m worried that this could end up hurting my relationship.
Why do I have this problem? I have to know I don’t play online and that my friends won’t play online either.
I’m not talking about local multiplayer like Fortnite or PUBG or Puyo puyo.
I’m talking about the possibility of other 3rd party services not working.
Like Discord or Mixer.
I have been really worried about it but I tried everything I tried and I just had no luck.
I have no idea how to solve this problem.
I’m not even talking about portability or even emulation or Switch games working with 4k.
I’m worried about portability and even emulation or Switch games working with 4K.
But I’ve been playing online for years and it is really worrying.
I have a friend who works at Nintendo UK and we have Discord playing Smash Brothers and The Messenger together. I can’t talk about it and we would just play Siege together. I got the same advice from him about Fortnite and PUBG.
It’s really worrying.
It’s a huge Nintendo Switch and I’m really worried about Nintendo UK and their relationship with Nintendo.
My advice is PSNow games working on Switch can’t work.
-----
Dee Dee: I think you're definitely right about not being able to play PS3 or PS4 games online. I don't think you should be worried about this, though.
I've had issues before with PS3 and I've had issues with PS4 too. I even had issues with OG Xbox and Xbox 360. I don't know if I've been affected by anything like this. I think you should take some advice about your relationship with your ISP before you decide to take action.

mazi: so they're in talks with sony for their first party games?
-----
Lite_Agent: Not really. Just a matter of when.
-----
Khanimus: I don't think it's a thing?
-----
Zalman: I don't think so. Nintendo has a contract with Sony for exclusives, in other words, a contract with a publisher.
-----
gabrielredu: It's not a thing. They've done presentations about the game pre-show.
-----
Cess007: I'm thinking that Ninty is in talks with Sony for their first party games.
I'm thinking more along the lines of Mercury Steam getting done and then getting a new studio.
-----
cw_sasuke: They have an agreement with sony for exclusive titles - next gen. ?
Maybe Nintendo will have their own project and will be like "wait they can do whatever they want".

Aters: If it is a deal, its a deal. They have exclusive rights for every platform under the sun.

~!~Why is it called Remake?

Mugy: For those who don't know, Remake is a modern day Resident Evil game similar to Resident Evil 2 Remake. It uses the Spencer Mansion engine and was developed by a single European studio on the side.
The Spencer Mansion is a 19th century women's museum and it's purpose is to display the history of Spencer Mansion in 18 months. It's currently being built and is expected to be completed in 2019. The main reason for the mansion, as the article says, is to symbolize the mansion and also to symbolize the mansion itself because it's currently being build.
Spoiler
The game is currently in development by American studios Volition and is being made by a British team called Grady Entertainment. 
So I ask you, why is it called Resident Evil?
-----
Jawmuncher: Probably just a name for the general consensus of Resi 1+2
-----
NEE HEE HEE: Probably a pun on "Resident Evil."
-----
SofNascimento: It's a reference to the fact that the Spencer Mansion is the #1 best-selling game of all time.
-----
Mugy: Well it's a reference to the fact that you can still play through the Spencer Mansion in Resident Evil 1.
-----
banter: Yeah it's a reference to a old hotel popularized in that game. 
It's a hotel operated by a religious cult and the main entrance is in Spencer Mansion in the Resident Evil remake.
-----
Dusk Golem: Because it symbolizes the end of the Survival-Horror trend (and the evolutionary "Resident Evil" genre in general), it's become a rallying cry for the other survival-horror fans of EWH, as if we, as an "average" fanbase, deserve to enjoy games like this.
It's also a reference to the fact that the Spencer Mansion is the best-selling game of 2018.
-----
SofNascimento: I could be wrong about it. But I think it's a pun on Resident Evil.
-----
Dreamboum: it's a hotel popularized in that game
-----
Mugy: True to it's trope of the final frontier

====================
~!~I guess I'm the only one who likes to be disappointed in games.

Rivenblade: So one of my biggest pet peeves is the feeling I get when people praise/hustle after a game.
Like, someone said something really cool about this feeling you have in the past and now people want something that just gets better?
I don't necessarily think of it as a negative, but something that could be fun to engage with.
In this thread I post a theme, it could be something that I am excited for, something I would enjoy seeing more of, something that I would be interested in seeing more of, something that I would get to play more of.
It's something I always feel like I would enjoy, it could even be something I have a really good time with. Like someone once mentioned H.R.M. Studios which is amazing.
In this case it is. It is a small example, but I feel people who talk about how much they love Hollow Knight. It's absolutely fantastic.
When I hear the term "hustle" I have to really think about it. I haven't heard of this game before today and I have played it a few times yes and it's absolutely incredible.
What do you all think?
Edit: I'm not particularly sure of what to attribute the OP to... Also, this is not the correct title for the thread.
-----
Funyarinpa: It's not a negative. I get a lot of praise for the game I like, but some people like to be disappointed and tickled to death.
-----
TheMoon: It's not a negative. It's only something I've seen in some Youtube comments and comments since I first started the thread.
-----
MegaSackman: I'm in the same boat, but I just wanna know what you all think OP!
One thing I liked about the game was how challenging it was. It's been on Game Pass, but I haven't played it yet, so I can't answer why you think it's good, but I think the challenge in the game is fun, if not fun!
-----
Warnen: Nothing negative about it imo. I loved the game in its original glory.
-----
Rivenblade: Yeah, I was just a little jealous of the praise it got for being so fun and full of promise while also not actually being

~!~Could we see a "5 star rating" for Marvel’s Spider-Man?

JCAD: I think it’s safe to say that Spider-Man is doing well to be at the top of the charts. 
Not interested in adoring the MCU movies, but I think it’d be great if it succeeded. There are a lot of great storytellers in the world and they have a lot of influence on movies. 
What do you guys think? Will we ever see this kind of “5 star” rating for Spider-Man, and what does that mean for movies? 
I think even a Hollywood studio is trying to adapt these movies to video games. 
Personally I would love if we could have more Spider-Man games, especially with the Netflix series. Actually the only Marvel game I have enjoyed is the Incredible Hulk series and that series is mostly about swinging around the web. I love that series but it is very repetitive. 
What do you guys think? Could a Hollywood studio take a fun swing at an awesome movie with a fun character like in the game?
-----
Jarmel: No
-----
benzopil: I think they are trying to adapt Spider-Man to video game format
-----
KZXcellent: They're taking the MCU way too far. I don't think they have anything else on the table other than swinging.
-----
Sjay1994: I think its better they have an open world game, but I also think they have a lot of story to tell.
-----
7threst: No.
-----
jrush64: I was going to have a laugh.
-----
Zippro: No, that would be a Middling rated movie.
-----
Plankton2: No, they are doing a fun game
-----
Zippro: No, they're taking the MCU way too far. They need a game that's similar to Marvel's Spider-Man in terms of gameplay and it's not very fun.

~!~What is the best way to play the first person bonfire games?

Swiggins: Been playing some Fallout 4 and I have never played a bonfire game.
I just want to know what the best way to play this genre is. Is it online, is it a mini-gates or is it a mixture of the two?
I have a PS4 Pro and a Switch. 
I’m thinking along the lines of how Resident Evil 4 works, fighting or sneaking around with the other players, and if you get spotted by another player, it’s just shooting through the head.
-----
Kenzodielocke: I think you should try wrecking someone's car.
-----
TailorDKS: You should try wrecking other players car.
Also try wrecking random NPCs in the same room
-----
Twiz: What's your starting gun story anyways?
-----
WieDerrickWie: Pervert
I have both, and I think I prefer it more in F4 than in 4. I think it's worth it to go for full movement, wreck, and finish offs, where it's a bit more of a shoot-by-play in F4.
-----
Carthago Delenda Est: I think you should just ignore the other players and do the stuff you really want from the combat. The second one is fine, but that's about it, the first is amazing and I enjoyed it more than the first.
-----
Barrylocke: I think the best way to play it is purely by playing the game online. That said, I prefer playing it solo.
-----
Beartruck: There are a few things you should consider:
- There are still a decent amount of things going on on the map, and you can still see your character.
- Factions are still useful, and you can still take part in PvP, which is pretty much the most fun you can have with friends if you're willing to play alone.
- In the end, if you enjoy the game a lot, it's not for you.
- You can still make money by playing the game, the grind is much lessened.

~!~All these remakes , except for Spider-Man PS4 , are so disappointing

Dreamboum: Spider-Man PS4 came out in 2012, and it looks so bad, it has almost become unbearable for me. The game in a nutshell, I would say.
Every time I go back to this video, it looks like the video is just ripping the game apart, it doesn't help that there's so much cutscenes that I have to watch. I mean, it's a PS4 exclusive, why would they remaster this if they had plans to release on PC? They should also remaster GTA IV, Vice City and IV? Then again, the original game was on PS3 and it looks like they want to remake it with modern graphics.
Spider-Man PS4 is still the most disappointing game in this list, and I'm pretty sure it'll be the case during the next generation of consoles.
-----
Lappe: Seriously. They should remaster every game they've ever released.
-----
InRainbows: I mean if they are remastering a ps3 game, remaking a ps4 game, remastering a xbox game, are they even morally right?
-----
Canucked: I disagree. I don't want remasters.
-----
Megatron: Yes, Spider-Man is one of the best games of all time. It had a good run, even if the story was a bit of a letdown.
-----
anexanhume: I agree. I thought the game was great. But I also think they should really re-imagined it with modern combat and maybe horses. They shouldn’t just go straight for a modern presentation. I think they could do a modern take on a modern Spider-Man game with that type of combat.
-----
VeePs: .
-----
KORNdog: it's funny how often the game makes you go "Oh shit, the guns shooting the air sucks?"

Flux: It's a beautiful game, but the way they treated it in the last year or so is just terrible.

I don't know what's the best place to play Xcom with the joy cons, but I hear good things about using the joy cons to play with the joy cons and there's plenty of options to play with them.
I know this is frowned upon, but is there a good OT that would recommend something like this?

~!~Do you think the Court of Owls might re-release the original Justice Project?

Harald23: Justice Project was the game that brought the original trilogy of games to smartphones, smartphones especially, in an era when "PS2 games were still predominantly PC games and even the XBOX console", i.e. they were not seen as "edgy" games that needed a publisher, including Atlus.
The Project re-release was announced the same day as Gamescom:
In the end, the game was not even re-released and the Project was "banned" by the fanbase, but there was a huge lawsuit against Atlus and a few people even got to hear the game is indeed still alive.
Now it seems that they are planning to re-release the trilogy, which is what lead to the current situation (they are asking the court of Owls for permission to reprint the original trilogy for the first time and asking the court of Owls for the re-release of the original trilogy for the first time, which is currently the case for the Persona 5 re-release which has been ongoing for over 25 years).
It's obviously a case where Atlus was not interested in re-selling the game (they had to pay for localization which is obviously not easy) but the court of Owls for the re-release of the original trilogy says that it was a transformative piece of technology and that it is deserving of a full development.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think it was a bad idea.
-----
Canucked: Man, I used to love Project Mira. The graphics, the music. I miss the original games.
-----
Eylos: I think its more than an idea, it's important to play original stuff
-----
Weiss: I mean, it was kinda more than that, after the court of Owls' resubmission, but they got a publisher and said fuck it, they're releasing it as a digital download for physical copies on their own platform.
-----
rude: It’s an unnecessary and sad fight. They should have re-released the trilogy on the same platform it was released on.
-----
HStallion: I think it's a great idea that will not fly off the shelves of every store in the world.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yes, but just because they are doing that and the publisher is not, doesn't

~!~Best platform to play 2D Zelda games?

Mcjmetroid: I have been wondering for a while which platform to play these 2D Zelda games. I feel like the 3D version of these games is the best.
I have the 2nd one on Switch. I was thinking of trying to play it but I have yet to do so.
I’m currently playing it on PS4. The controls are great but the game is so much easier to play in handheld mode.
I’m currently on PS4 but I have noticed that the game is more difficult to play in handheld mode.
I’m currently playing it on Switch and I think that it is a lot easier to play in handheld mode.
The first two hours are a bit marred by terrible frame rate. I’m currently on a 60fps 720p 720p game and the frame rate feels awful.
I’m currently holding off playing this until I see some Switch footage.
I’m currently holding off playing the game until I see footage of when it will release on Switch.
Any advice I can provide would be greatly appreciated. Keep in mind I have not played the third act and am playing in small bursts.
Edit: I am currently playing in portable mode.
-----
Farrac: Play it on Switch. It's a much more enjoyable Zelda game than the 2D ones. Also, if you have a DS you can play it on that.
-----
QuixoticNeutral: I have a back log so I can't lend my PC to someone who already has Zelda games on their system, and my backlog of older Nintendo games is already large enough that I don't have any room for a full-blown PC or a different third-party portable and getting them running on a handheld or PC sounds like too much to ask for.
I'd rather play it on an iPad rather than a Switch, though, because that has the better built-in support from a gameplay standpoint.
I'm currently holding off playing it until I see footage of BotW on Switch and hear what you're talking about, but it seems pretty likely.

MomoVideo: I played the first hour, I think it took you 20 minutes. Then I delved into the dungeon and got more comfortable with the controls.
While I am not finished with the game yet, I definitely recommend it to

~!~What is your favorite video game intro?

SolVanderlyn: I'm sorry if this has to be a repeat thread, but I haven't had the balls to include the Naughty Dog one.
I haven't played any of the sequels, but the intro made me tear up. First off, how did you find that one? And it's the only one I've played.
I loved this one.
Second, third, and fourth.
I actually haven't seen the Naughty Dog one.
First off, I'm already 30, and I'm not old enough to understand video games. Second, I've never seen the Naughty Dog intro before. And third, I'm already 20. So, what are you favorite video game intro ever?
-----

TheBeardedOne: The title screen intro.
It's the intro to Rise, Vincent, and Rise Again.

snausages: The one from Nier Automata

====================
~!~I have questions about my Nintendo Switch.

Jedi2016: Okay, so I just got an Switch. There doesn't seem to be many games for it yet, and I don't know if I have a lot of interesting things- I know the library is huge, but I'm wondering if there are any games I'm missing that I could try. I mean, I know nothing about it, but I just wanted to see if there were any other games you guys and girls think would fit the Switch well.
I can find the following games out on Google and it looks like they are all great.
1. Redout (I haven't tried it in the past, but I got this one day)
2. Wizard of Legend (I don't know if this is good or not- I've never played it, but it seems to have a good combat system. I've heard good things about the game)
3. Hollow Knight (I haven't tried it in the past, but I heard good things about it, and I've heard that the combat looks good)
4. Splatoon 2 (I haven't tried it in the past, but I'm intrigued, I've heard good things, but still haven't tried it)
5. Nintendoland (I recently played this on my SNES, and it was great, but I'm not a fan of the artstyle)
6. Mario Kart 8 (I've heard that it looks decent, and I've heard good things about the game, but haven't tried it yet)
7. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (I've heard great things about the game, but haven't tried it yet)
8. Mario and Luigi Dream Team (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
9. Fire Emblem: The Path of Radiance (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
10. The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
11. Mario and Luigi Dream Team (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
12. Pokken Tournament DX (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
13. Metroid: Samus Returns (I've heard that it looks decent, but haven't tried it yet)
14. Rayman
====================
~!~I was hyped for SHRemaster, but this was a mess and it feels like the game was born too late

Dreamboum: I think it's a shame, a while back SHRemaster was released.
I remember being completely let down with how unfinished the game ended up being, and I still don't know exactly why I was hyped for this, but now I'm pretty sure it was a mistake and I'm not even sure I wanted to spend the entire game on it.
I'm very disappointed to say the least.
I can't believe it was made by three guys with a budget of less than £15,000 who thought they could make a better game next time, but instead they just made a shite shite RPG made by random people who suck and lied to you.
It's like they had a lot to learn from that unfinished game, but the result was a very unappealing at best. 
I think it's a shame they decided to go for PS4 instead of Switch when opportunity should have been for another shite RPG.
-----
Strings: I don't know how to elaborate this, but I was super sceptical about SHRemaster, but I forgot how much I loved it. I really hope they're able to strike a good balance between adding a lot of content and QoL improvements.
-----
Dreamboum: I don't know if this is a joke but I was also really disappointed by the lack of an impression of the game
-----
Strings: I also completely forgot how much I actually liked the world and story, but I could have been so much more interested in the story and worldbuilding.
I don't have much hope at least in regards to the RPG aspects, and I think it would have been a real shame to die (something that I can understand).
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I didn't even remember it being unfinished
-----
SOLDIER: The game was barely even out during development, and was somewhat in development trouble at the time, so they shifted all that so that it's development was definitely far into its first half rather than starting as they did. I'm not convinced it was too much work for some reason.
-----

====================
~!~Will we ever see more games like The Last Guardian?

Wololo: I mean was the game released this year ever critically acclaimed? It was released in 2013 and hasn't looked out of the spotlight for over a decade.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it’s been out for like two years and it’s not even focused on the game.
Maybe Rockstar does it’s own marketing.
-----
cognizant: I think you mean The Last Guardian. It's been out for 17 years and it's not even focused on the game, it's just some random indie game out for a whimper.
-----
LonestarZues: I would love it if they did a sequel that does what the fans wanted. It's been out for over a decade and I'm not sure they can do it justice.
-----
BubbleButt64: I remember hearing about it a year or two ago.
The Last Guardian was one of my favorite PS2 games at the time.
-----
Toumari: I'd love a sequel.
-----
Ōkami Haundo: I'd love a sequel. It was the first game I played on my PS3 and hearing people talk about how great it was and having some of the biggest bosses in the series... I had completely forgotten about the game but holy shit I loved it. It's one of my favorite games of all time and I think such a shame that the people who developed the game didn't make more for it. I mean it's not like they're really obligated to make a sequel as long as it keeps the unique vibe of the first game.
-----
SageShinigami: I'd love a sequel. Better bosses, better pacing, better atmosphere, better gameplay, better atmosphere and more music. I remember the first game having really good boss fights.
-----
GusZamboni: i hope it will be re-released on psn, they are right there with sony

~!~What would you play if you could? (and how many?) Nintendo Switch Online titles?

malyse: (Sorry, I don't even know what to use this)
Spoiler
-----
Razor Mom: A "searched" google translation that came out of the DF Retrocast.
-----
Kolx: A bunch. Dont think it'll be worth the effort. I still think if it's worth it, it'll be worth $20 or less.
-----
Cartridge Games: I’m not sure if they’d sell it all. I think it’d be more feasible if Nintendo just gives it away for free to people who own the system.
-----
Krejlooc: I think so. Nintendo's been trying really hard to open their own ecosystem for years. Sure, they couldn't do that for years, but they had a few big games that did come out that got some support.
-----
Jahranimo: As long as it's just a list of titles that'll eventually be available on the system, I'm all for it.
-----
Kouriozan: I’m not really interested in NES games, I’m a fan of the classics like Mario Bros. and Super Metroid, so it’s not like I’d be interested in playing NES games.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I'd play the Mii, but I don't want to play it myself.
-----
Clov: I would play what I have. I would buy it, but I would not buy it because I'd be paying for a subscription to Nintendo Online.
-----
Cybersai: I mean, I wouldn't buy a single NES game, for example. I'd buy the same thing for a lot of Nintendo games.
-----

====================
~!~Why are gamers so shitty?

zombipuppy: If you don't like something, you don't like it. We all have opinions and that means there's a lot to take seriously and not just what we like. 
This is a not so subtle phenomenon.
Assholes are common, reasonable people enjoy their interactions with other people and when they're not having fun, they usually end up whining.
But why are gamers shitty? Why am I enjoying my group? Why am I enjoying this group? 
And why do I have a problem with a certain type of gamer culture?
-----
Heckler456: It's not exclusive to gamers. There are many more types of gamers out there than you are, and there's an inverse correlation between the amount of asshole type people in your group and the amount of asshole type people in your group.
-----
texhnolyze: I don't understand the purpose of this topic, to be honest.
I never heard of this, but I don't think I've ever seen anyone call a video game "a shitty game" or call it "retro."
-----
kennyamr: I think the term shitty is a synonym for a whole different type of mentality.
People are shitty because they don't like video games, they don't like other games, they don't like the medium.
-----
Phediuk: I like to think there's a difference between gamers and people who like video games.
-----
The Real Napsta: It's not exclusive to gamers. Being shitty is a whole different type of mentality.
-----
zombipuppy: Yeah but gamers are just bunch of impatient whining idiots. They don't like video games. They don't play them.
-----
TheRealNapster: I’m not sure what you mean exactly. I mean how do you know they’re not into video games? There are a lot of trolls - like they’re proud of themselves or whatever - but also they don’t like being called shitty on purpose?
-----
Asbsand: I mean, of course they are. Some gamers are not shitty. Some gamers are not smart or hard of hearing. They don't like being called shitty because they’re loud and angry.
There’s a whole different type of person to biouse that mentality.
-----
====================
~!~I would like to play some games on my Switch.

cucholix: A few days ago I was in the market for a Switch, since I noticed that it has some exclusive games that I would like to play.
I have two questions:
1. If I have already played these, which ones should I buy?
2. Should I even wait for patches for the same games?
Thank you!
Edit: It’s been mentioned in the title in the thread, but I bet this list is not exhaustive and might contain SP-only titles.
-----
Cartridge Games: It’s probably been in the topic of what are you looking for most. If you’re interested, buy it. If not, drop a link.
-----
MattAces: Super Mario Odyssey
-----
Mullet2000: Super Mario Party
-----
Cybersai: Super Mario Odyssey is still in the Christmas sale so if you're into Wii Sports, go for that.
-----
ReyVGM: Super Mario Odyssey
-----
Skronk: Ni No Kuni 2

~!~Which box art are you buying?

UltraMav: I’m keeping an eye on this thread because I’ve been curious about this subject for a while. I’ve never seen a boxart put around before. What are some of your favorite box arts and what do you think is the best one?
-----
Liam Allen-Miller: I think the one that started it all was Phalanx’s Champion and then that was Marvel’s Spider-Man.
-----
AztecComplex: The Marvel box art is always good.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: I remember getting the MvCI Spider-Man bundle and not being able to resist buying the 20-page paper+ pages of content.

Cap G: Can't really pinpoint what I like best, but I remember that one that was pretty good as far as characterizations goes.

Pariah: I like the Iron-Man illustration from Helix's Secret Labs.

Khanimus: I love the abstract "Spider-Man" cover from Marvel vs DC.

====================
~!~What are your favorite gameplay transitions in video games?

TheFallenSaboteur: I was recently thinking about this and it's kind of funny because it was the first thing I did in Resident Evil 4. I finished the game a few hours ago and it took me another ten hours to beat it, but I remember doing it right at the beginning of a power-up fight with a scientist in a factory. I didn't pay attention to what he was doing or what he was doing on the factory, but I didn't notice his presence or anything. I thought the fight was fine and I was ready to go home but the moment he showed up I didn't pay attention to what he was doing.
Later on I went to the government building and I noticed that there were a lot of gashes in the walls and I thought there might have been some type of agent or laser radar effect in there. I went back to the factory and looked around to make sure it wasn't there but no! No way it was there. I then noticed that the scientist had his whole arm split open, his stomach was open, then he was in a huge embrace and I gasped a lot when I found it. I thought I'd tried to run (and hide) him in a giant ball and he was gone. I picked up a pistol and shot the agent and he shot me in the back right in the head. I sat back more then I stood still and continued:
All the way till the Sun and I shot him with it. The scene was great and I love it. I love the whole playfulness of a hawk. I guess that's the point of RE.
Also the last time you kill an agent or machine gun guy is when you're messing with them. I got an agent with a machine gun and I shot him. He just lay there like "OMG that was a headshot, what happened?" and I avoided his eye. And when I did, I remember the red spot on his cheek where he got his arm cut off. I thought that was a headshot.
I'm not sure how I was supposed to handle the situation, but I just decided to shoot at his face and he shot dead.
Most games these days offer you methods and you need to practice them to get a game over. RE4 was a good example of this.

~!~[PC] 90 Day To You - Do You Know AI Horror Games?

oni-link: First time I've heard of it
So, this is a thread to talk about horror games
So, I've had my fair share of experiences with horror games, most recently working on Silent Hill 2 (and 3), and this was my first time making a thread. I thought it'd be interesting to see the general reaction to these games, so I started a little flame war thread to voice my opinion and get as many responses as possible
Here are the general thoughts
I've heard horror games are a great way to develop and explore the medium and that's why this thread is basically about doing the opposite of what you already do to the game. Instead of doing the "play horror and write story" thing, let's do this
How to do this
This is the whole point of horror games. This is essentially a horror game. This is about writing stories to explore the horror and they can be anything. Anything is possible. Anything is possible. This is the whole point of horror games.
What are your thoughts on this? What kind of game do you want to play it and why?
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: It's not about the best writing, it's about the pacing. If you want horror to last forever, you need to play it. You don't need to watch a cutscene or follow a story unless you're 100% invested in it.
-----
WarAdept: Horror is about pacing. 
It's not about the best writing. It's about the pacing of the game. 
It's a matter of analyzing the pacing of the game and going in.
-----
Vito: It is a genre. 
That said, it doesn't matter what genre you are playing, the genre you are playing, the genre you are playing. Horror can never last forever. It's a genre. 
It's what penises longevity and happiest people have on the face of their dead bodies. 
The problem with horror is not that it's particularly unpleasant, it's that it's pretty unpleasant. So it's not like it's right now. 
This is how horror is now. Making horror movies is easy, people don't need to watch the cutscenes, they can just avoid the internet, and so on. 
I am not opposed to horror, but I

~!~Japan-exclusive Switch games this month

ggx2ac: Link: 
Some games are not listed per their forum rules:
Chrono.Switch is not a strictly Nintendo country. You can buy the game only on the country it's published in.
Price per copy:
Usually around $40.
Games with language support:
Usually includes English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Climax
There's also a lot of games with Japanese voice acting, including danganronpa, Tokyo mirage and more.
There is a lot more information on the FAQ if you want to know about the games and their language support.
Suggestions to make the process better:
-----
LordKano: The switch version of bastion  is apparently not supported yet.
-----
Bjones: I heard about this game. Is it a good game?
-----
DarkDetective: I would highly recommend the FFXV translation by the director of Illusion of Gaia. It is hilaratiouous.
Edit: oh, it is a PS2 game. Annoying some of the faithful but otherwise a really good show.
-----
Piscus: Is this localized and developed by From Software? I saw in the ESRB website that the game is listed under the "Genre" subpage. I feel like the rights still belong to From.
-----
CaviarMeths: I would highly recommend the FFXV translation. It's a translation of the Japanese text for the Final Fantasy VII remake, which is coming out in October. There's tons of dialogue changes, now there is a slight alteration of the title of the title in the PS2 version.
I think the name of the game is "A Clockwork Orange" - and it's name is on the front of the credits, and the name of the game is "Oath of the Sword God".
-----
Xavi: Great thread this is coming to ERA. I'm playing it right now.

Zalman: Great thread! Will OP be updating the OP as well as clearing the confusion.

~!~What if Sony had a huge vision for their next gen console?

Toriko: That's the most obvious question. I am still waiting for a new PlayStation, but with all the expectations tied to this new console and its hardware, I think it is time to think about what they could do in the next few years.
Sony first party output includes:
New 
Third party
PlayStation exclusive
Third party exclusives
What do you think?
-----
Toumari: They should use their considerable experience in making first party titles to try and make the mind of a new generation about investing in new IPs instead.
-----
Knight613: They should embrace open world games with a more realistic graphics style.
-----
Heckler456: They should embrace open world games instead.
-----
Jawbreaker: They should embrace open worlds too, even if they have some catching stones.
-----
Flux: They should embrace VR too, even if only for the limited scope of the experience.
-----
The Last Wizard: They should embrace open world games.
-----
Luschient: They should embrace open world.
-----
Toriko: They should embrace open world.
-----
CaviarMeths: They should embrace open world.

~!~Worth playing The Witcher 3 in 2018?

H3rTz DoNuT: I am talking more about games I really want to play, like I have done in the past, and Witcher 3 is my #1 for being one of the best RPGs of all time. I have a PS4 Pro and a powerful PC to play these games on. I have it on Steam.
So, I was wondering, if I should really bother?
I have done everything in my power to not get stuck at the final dungeon. I was overwhelmed by the amount of side quests, I had to do them in order, I cleared every side activity, I really wanted to complete the main story, I really wanted to go through every side quest. I just started every side quest I had. I had a good time with it. But I need to know, what's the endgame? I have a high-level character, and I want to know what's the final content?
Is it even possible?
Is it worth playing?
I am interested in reading up about the story and characters, but I'm also curious about the side-quests.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: yes, Witcher 3 is great, if you already played W3, then it's a good one
-----
Flux: The Witcher 3 is fantastic.
-----
hydrophilic attack: it's a game that you will find it difficult to get used to, but playing the first two hours of it is a blast
-----
Matthew77: Why not get the ps4 version and see if you like it?
-----
Kinsei: It's a great game and a worthy one to play for sure.
-----
KujoJosuke: The characters alone justify a good amount of its value. Each character has personality that most other RPGs lack. 
W3 is also great if you already got the series before 2. It's the only one with good character designs, world building and music.
-----
hydrophilic attack: the combat is amazing, specially considering the amount of backtracking
-----
LonestarZues: I'd say yes to that.
-----
Knives-Blood: I mean, I played the first two hours. It's a well-done game if you've played the first two.
