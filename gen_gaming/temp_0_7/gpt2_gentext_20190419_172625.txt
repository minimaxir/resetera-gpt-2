~!~Most you ever liked a game?

theofficefan99: I've seen alot of "why do I like this so much?" threads lately.
Some people seem to love a game despite not necessarily being a fan, and some people seem to dislike games in general.
Like, what are some games that managed to remain a complete you?
-----
TheMoon: Most I ever liked:
- Metal Gear Solid 3
- Final Fantasy XV
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- Dragon Quest XI
-----
theofficefan99: I loved Final Fantasy XV, but I didn't like FFXV
-----
TheBuschManOfChoice: 1. Castlevania Lords of Shadow
2. The entire Legend of Zelda series
3. Mass Effect 2
-----
Wulfric: The Witcher series and The Witcher and the Mass Effect series
-----
Dinjoralo: Probably Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age.
I enjoyed a lot of JRPG's at the time, but never played them. I feel like I was missing out on something, and I'd be interested in playing an RPG again if I played a lot of them.
-----
theofficefan99: I wish a lot of games from this era would get sequels/follow-ups on the current platforms
-----
Deleted member 15538: Yep. I was gonna play FFXII when I heard the story had you as a young boy trying to understand a version of the Dragon Gene.
-----
RochHoch: I didn't like FF12 for long, but the whole series felt like homework.
I also didn't like the GBA wave of PS1 RPGs. I only played a little of FFXII, but that was a pretty long time ago.
-----
Charamiwa: I liked the games that I've played from these days. The only ones I actually regret playing are FF7 and FFXV, and I think that's pretty much the standard. I've played most of the new games though, so I'm not quite certain if I want to.

~!~The world of Pokémon is fascinating. Tell me what you want to know about in Pokémon Go

WrenchNinja: So as I have been slowly collecting more and more Pokémon in my PokeCamps, I've been slowly collecting Pokemon. I have been slowly playing through Gold and Silver and I have been slowly playing HeartGold and SoulSilver, but my experience of the series has been basically dusting off my backups of the last fifteen Pokémon games.
Now, as I type this, I realize that I am about to play HeartGold, SoulSilver, and Emerald. They are the new games from the original 151 in my eyes.
This is so disheartening. I wish I had a primer for these games, but it is pretty much a standard RPG format. It made me think about whether I should get into the series.
So I have been slowly playing through HeartGold and SoulSilver. I am just now playing Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. I am just at the 2nd world.
I have been playing just to discuss and talk about this game and what it's about. I am just playing right now, and I am just at a point I just described in my post What I want to know in Pokémon Go in order to understand what I should be playing.
So I am about to play HeartGold and SoulSilver.
First of all, I am playing on the original N64. I am aware that it uses the same graphics as the original games but it is missing some of the new features and dialogue.
I think that is kind of a huge bummer.
I am just going to call it Pokemon Go, and I am curious what else I should play and what I should listen to. I am not playing as many Pokemon as I should or even being aware of what I should be playing.
I am playing through the first 4 or 5 hours of the game (right now).
1. Introduction
I am a Pokemon fan. I have played the first 3 Gens and have been interested in hearing opinions on the game, but I always find this to be rather surface-level compared with the others.
In my case, I am somewhat interested in the story and lore. I like the graphics, the setting, I kinda like how it looks, the music, and the characters.
I am currently playing on the original Xbox.
That is a pretty big difference in opinion. I am not a huge fan

~!~The power of 2K18 Shotgun

Deleted member 1258: With the current hype and rumors of the new God of War, with the Switch reveal, and with the possibility of a new GTA V, 2K18's new weapon of choice is the power of their new game, the Eos.
When they revealed the weapon in their previous reveal, the sound effect was all but completely blown out of the sky.
Now, after watching a few videos, it's clear that they only just made it more powerful by re-balancing it to match the Switch. First of all, the sound effect was reduced to a sort of muffled humming sound when docked. The most obvious cut-off would be changing the color scheme of the Eos to match the Switch.
Additionally, it doesn't sound like the shotguns from GB show much of a difference.
So, what do you think? Is Eos just a temporary powergap that Spider-Man will need to fill up the gap while RDR2 goes through? Or is Eos only for gameplay purposes for this new weapon of choice? Do you think it's worth the cost for Rockstar to go this route on their first attempt and go the full power leap?

Deleted member 1258: Doesn't sound like a lot of money

====================
~!~I thought the new God of War was a bit boring.

Phantom Thief: I mean, I’m not talking about issues with the game, I mean, I know it’s God of War, but I
Was thinking more positive things about it, even though it was boring as hell. 
The opening to this game was mind-blowing. 
You look through this environment and you see how diverse the spaces are (with all these different environments) and you know they’re going to be a very, very varied place. 
And then, the opening really drives home that the story is an adventure and it’s not just another chase scene with a baby chasing a baby. It’s a journey of self-discovery, an escape from an existential crisis. And at that point, the game is so good, you just can’t stop playing. 
I finished the game yesterday. 
I thought it was a great, great movie, and now I’m thinking of giving it a shot. 
I thought about the opening a few times, and it was cool. But then, it just clicked against me. 
Sure, I know it’s a different opening, but it doesn’t have that “what am I supposed to do?” vibe. And it didn’t feel like the opening was “I’m struggling, trying to do as much as I can”, it just felt like, it made me feel like I was missing something. 
I guess I could forgive these problems if I didn’t have a PS4, but I kind of wish I had one. Or maybe I just need to let the games die. I know I do. I guess I’m just wondering if the same thing would be happening if the game was not an adventure game with puzzles and puzzles-and-riddles but open world.
-----
Mitsurugi: It’s a great game but it’s ultimately a linear story about doing the journey and not finding answers to what exactly happened
-----
Ratchetdude231: Go back to where you were when you first experienced the game. That's what those puzzles are from. If you forget to look for answers, you're stuck looking for solutions.

~!~Suda51 would like to see Persona & Xenogears in the Persona Dancing Hall lineup

FrontierGamer: So, I just bought Persona 5 Dancing, my favorite game. I love the characters and the world. I love the soundtrack. But I just realized that I don’t know anything about the Persona Dancing Hall. I can’t figure out what to look for? It said it’s coming to the West in a couple of days. I was hoping for the Etrian Odyssey TTP thread, but I guess I was hoping for the P3DES.
I want to see them in the Persona Dancing Hall. I just can’t figure out what to look for.

KZXcellent: They're the most iconic and iconic Persona characters. I'm looking for it too.

Grexeno: I'd love to see them.

Papaya: I'd love them too.

~!~I still can't believe that the PS2 that came out in the fall of 1996 is called a PS2 in the west.

Uzumaki Goku: I don't know if this is old or just me, but for some reason during the summer of 1996 I was playing some SNES RPGs on my PS2 at my friend's house, when a friend of mine who was a PS2 owner came into the house and asked me what my name was and told me I was Kazumi who was his mom and that's why he's the way he is.
I was like, fuck this guy and I played all the RPGs that came out during that time, and that's the only RPG I played on my PS2 that I remember.

Transistor: I had a friend that got me a PS2 with Horizon. I had a friend that rented me games for the Christmas he was playing on it too. 
I used to play RPGs when I was a kid, or maybe I was kids

~!~What do you want out of the next Smash Bros for Switch?

DemonCarnotaur: Just finished reading Smash Bros Ultimate and while I loved the game, I think it's fair to assume that the next Smash Bros will focus on the roster it originally had made. A few things I want out of it:
More characters. Smash needs more fighters. More than you can handle.
More variation in moves. Like in previous Smash games, you can actually do combos in the air, but in this, you have to do special moves.
A bigger roster. Smash 4 had a few characters that are super-stars or could change their placement, but I think that's going to be the Smash we end up playing with.
A more fleshed out cast. More than anything else, I think it's important for the game to have at least one female fighter per iteration.
A more sprawling online competitive setting. I don't want Smash to have this huge huge open world with hundreds of islands that you can explore and interact with. I want a city with wide ocean, a town located somewhere in the city, as a sort of tropical destination.
This is the first of a series of open world Smash games, but it could be the meat of the game.
I don't want this to be an online multiplayer thing. Smash online is Smash, we can't have an open world Smash game with this much depth. It needs to be a sprawling game with lots of activities, cities, shops, a story mode, etc. I want it to feel like an open world Smash game, but with more detailed online functionality.
-----
Salty Rice: Do you want the game to have some variety or depth?
Smash Bros 4 had tons of characters and did everything the game had to offer.
-----
Aigis: More stages, maybe some unique stuff, etc. 
I just want them to learn from smash in a lot of ways and not just copy and paste everything. They should come up with a new one every 4-6 months, at least.
-----
KZXcellent: More playable characters and it'll be like Smash 4/5/6 where you can do everything, even unlock new moves. 
It'll be like Smash 4 in a way.
-----
KZXcellent: It's really a shame we'll probably never get a proper online competitive game. We really need something like Rocket

~!~Do you have any hand pain from playing a game?

BAD: I’m trying to decide between RDR2 and Smash Ultimate
I recently started playing Horizon Zero Dawn and Destiny 2 but couldn’t get over the awful playing.
I thought it was just the rough edges in the camera and controls but now I’m trying to get over that.
I can’t play a lot of fighting games but I was planning to play Tekken 6 and Soulcalibur 6.
I have no idea what to do at the moment.

Cartridge Games: Played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate a bit last night and it's not too bad.
Doesn't hurt to ask!

MaitreWakou: I've never gotten that problem. I just play a lot.
I've never gotten that problem, I just started playing a lot.
I'm not saying it's every borked every other week, but I just have this problem with most games. It isn't even a visual bug, it's just a borked reflex when I climb a certain ledge, it's on you.
-----
TheBaldwin: I’ve gotten that problem with pretty much all platformers, most recently on rain in dark skies.
I think I just *need* to play a little more to get that same feeling.

I’ve had borked reflexes in games before, this is the first time.

~!~Hovering with the brush in low-poly shadowboxing - does regular/fake shadows count?

cakely: First off, I love how this is a staple of PC gaming. I love how my controller's lightsource field of view is behind my head. It makes shadowing my bread and butter.
However, I'm getting more creative with the brush I play in the DOOM and HLK games. I find that I can use the full extent of the scale I've used in DOOM 15 times, and in HLK I can use the whole range I can use. It's a real gamechanger.
How do you feel about this? Do you go back and forth if you use the full range you can use within your games, or go nuts and use the best you can, but you always end up spending about 1 inch from the point of view of your game, and then just end up using the best you could? Do you go crazy and use the brush because of camera positioning, or do you just... don't, but the same if you use the whole range you can use?
-----
Viking Jesus: I don't know what the purpose of the scale is supposed to be, but I always end up using the best I can.
-----
Nooblet: I don't really know what the purpose of the brush is. I assume I can always just pop the camera up to direct it to where I want it to be, and that's all I have. But occasionally I find myself using it really awkwardly if I want to use the best I can.
I also found that Shadow of the Colossus PS4 has a really cool implementation of the full range of perspective. The PS4 camera is just right where I want it to be, and that is in direct view. I can see where the enemy is on my character, and as I sit there I can see my health bar decrease on hit and I can re-battle.
I have used the whole range in Shadow of the Colossus.
-----
Barrylocke: I wonder if the general consensus is to use the general scale that you're used to, like the scale of Titan Temple in the PS3/PS4 remake of Mid-Earth's Grid (when you first enter it you're in the compressed space around the planet and thus would be affected, but as you gain more and more of the scale you gain a wider view

~!~I've decided to stop caring about platform collecting after playing Mario Party

asmith906: Been playing this game and it's been pretty fun. I like the idea of Mario Party. It has a nice variety of minigames and a fun minigame festival. However I'm stuck in this game.
1) I find it really dull to play. The usual floaty, small level gimmicks and weird gimmicks just make it just a boring, simple, repetitive and dull mario party. I don't even want to try and win or anything. I just want to play something stupid and creative. It's just something I don't feel like having the time and money to invest in a full experience.
2) I find it lacking in its presentation. The game has this one bit that I don't get. The title of the game is about a team of heroes vs a bunch of villains who decide their own fate. The game has this "boss battle" mode where you run around collecting stars to help your team out. I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for or if its just really generic platforming gimmicks. I feel like I just want to collect coins and not really get any rewards or anything.
I guess what I'm here for and now that I have my fill of the game. What's left is a boring mario platformer. I bought the DX bundle and my friends are excited to play this.
-----
Renna Hazel: I feel your pain. I've played Mario Party for over 15 hours and have been coming up with ideas to play with friends. I'm sure you'll like it, but I don't agree that the game is designed to be played with friends.
-----
Phediuk: you're missing the point
-----
FairyEmpire: Yeah, that's something that's hard to nail down inclassed to me. I'm expecting a lot of flops in the beginning and a mediocre mini-campaign once you're gripped with the basic concepts. The game doesn't really do that much beyond that, not even once landing good placements, and that's over a 20 hours.
The one thing that I do not get, despite being far, far behind in the skill ceiling of most characters, is that if I'm not able to get a spot on a team based matchmaking system. Matchmaking for each of those matches is awful, not

~!~The Best and Worst of Xbox One: X Enhanced Games

Nerdyone: I was just really hyped for Forza Horizon 4, but when the game finally arrives I'm not feeling it. I'm not like a PC gamer, but I also don't have a 4K TV. So I decided to go with the X and buy all these amazing games on X Enhanced.
All the games are maxed out and all the enhancements look amazing. Some look even better than Horizon 4, some look even better than Forza Horizon 3. Some look like really impressive remasters of 2008 games, some look downright remasters of the original games.
Most importantly, these enhanced games almost always look even better than the originals.
------
If you recall, Horizon was one of the best looking games on consoles up until E3 2006. Forza Horizon 3 was one of the better looking games on consoles up until E3 2006.
-----
Dancrane212: I remember a lot of folks were excited about Evolution Studios' Forza Motorsport 5. I remember everyone saying it looked and sounded phenomenal.
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: I think I'm going to play through that again. Feels better.

Xumbrega: Not enough remasters of the old stuff.
-----
Phantom Thief: You mean the best or most enhanced versions of the games?
-----
Green Slime King: I wouldn’t say Horizon is enhanced, it’s just better.
-----
G_Shumi: Yeah, I'm going to play through Evolution's Forza Motorsport 5. I'm also in the middle of a crazy driving streak and am starting to get a little upset at myself for not winning races in Forza 4.
-----
rrc1594: I love it. I'm not a racing fan at all but it's so much fun.

~!~LTTP: Kingdom Hearts III (spoilers I guess)

Synohan: Finished it a few weeks ago and it was a blast. The game is so good I had a lot of issues with it. Too bad the music is soo good though.
First of all I loved the story. It had a surprisingly strong, enthusiastic, and heartwarming ending. The whole game had that "You made me happy" vibe that a lot of people towards the end felt like.
Then the music. I think it's one of the best OST I've heard in a game. It's pretty much a Dreamcast/Saturn track that really puts you in the zone with the rest of the Disney.
The use of violins, cell tracks, bananobas, and violins still hasn't left my mind like in other games. They're still hard to find nowadays.
I don't know why this is considered as great, but the OST is also really catchy. Every single one of them.
The boss fights and boss battles were so good. The whole game had so much promise, but it just didn't happen. 
Dropping down into some random dungeon and going "Oh no, there is ice blocks?" was such a bore. It's a shame because I love the game.
The dungeons were so good. I wish the side quests and Organization wasnt so lame.
The music was also top notch. There was a lot of nostalgia and happy moments because of KH. Most of them were catchy and well done.
The music is by far my favourite in the series. It's different from most FFs in that nowadays the music is just as hype sounding and relaxing. The music in this game is just sooo good.
The reason I liked the ending so much was because of how well Organization went about it. They actually planned everything and they wrote a huge storyline in the end. It's an interesting twist to how the game was supposed to be. Now they just decided to drop the whole storyline. Who can say?
The music was also the reason I went to the end earlier. Just everything was so relaxing to me.
The way they made everything worked perfectly. They just decided to drop the whole storyline and just end the game with Kingdom Hearts.
The game was still really fun and it was soo good.

~!~Recommend me some PS1 era games

delete12345: I remember when the internet was completely unknown to devs when it came to PS1 titles.
I remember being able to find PS1 classics on the Playstation Store, and I found a few good PS1 classics that I want to play.
However, I don't know if I have the right to play in the PS1 era.
So, I want to recommend some PS1 era games.
Thanks in advance.
-----
EvilChameleon: There are so many PS1 era games I don't know I want to play at this point, and I do want to play them all.
-----
Tohsaka: I think that's the only way to play them. They're always on sale on the PS Store.
-----

I think you should just search for PS1 classics first.

====================
~!~The Lost Child needs to be remade or at least made into a game.

Hace: It's weird how this thread got out of control and still hasn't gotten much traction since
The Lost Child is an indie game that is basically a glorified beat 'em up. It has a great story, great music, a great gameplay, and a neat easter eggs in the ending.
The last time this game got some attention was in 2013 with the release of the original game on PS3, but since then, it has gone silent and no sign of a sequel or even a port to the PS4.
What would you like it to be remade?
-----
CannonFodder52: I adored the first one, but it's sort of a terrible game.
Have the first story beat and the second game is a glorified beat 'em up.
-----
Dr. Caroll: It's a simple, but yet fun take on an NES story. My guess is that the publisher is happy to add narrative to it.
-----
makonero: I remember liking this one.
-----
Mega Man Zero: I like the original. The story is pretty bad but I like it.
-----

Kraid: I really liked this one.
I'd like to be able to play through the story more.
-----
Araujo: I was just thinking about this game a few days ago. I love this game.
Especially the first half, where the game plays off of the NES inspired art style so well.
I don't think people have a problem with this stuff. It's not an uncommon art style, it's a pure NES style.
-----

Opa-Opa: The first one is so good. I remember liking the second one as well.

~!~The next 3D platformer that should've been released in the late 90's

SolVanderlyn: My favorite game of all time. It was ahead of its time. I remember everyone flipping their hair out in excitement as the next installment to the SNES hit, "Super Mario World".
It's a shame I can't recall anyone talking about a game with this much popularity, let alone one with the budget and development expertise to allow a sequel to be released at all.
What do you think?
-----
Lant_War: X-Com 2 was super cheap, and the 3D was also pretty good. I remember the first one being on sale for $25.
-----
Svart: I've been meaning to play the first one.
-----
Tailzo: I liked the original game a lot but I think I will finally get around to it. I have the PS2 version but never got around to it, so maybe I'll finally pick it up.
-----
Solid: I love the SNES version of Rondo.
Rondo is probably the best 2D platformer on the NES. And the music!
Rondo is also really cheap, and I actually played that one on a friend's PS2 and we both loved it. The first game had me rolling and shouting at the time, and I could not play the second game without giving it a bad feeling.
-----
Tibarn: I loved the PS2 version, specially after the first level. I thought it was the best 2D platformer, but it was also early 2000s, so I'm biased.
-----
Svart: Ah, yeah, I was going to say I had a similar experience to you OP, but I'm not sure.
-----
Basileus777: The SNES version of Rondo is still my favorite.
-----
SolVanderlyn: I have enjoyed the first game quite a lot (wanted to play the second) but am a little biased. I consider it the last of the very best 2D platformers on the NES.
-----
SolVanderlyn: You are right, I never found the SNES version to be particularly good. I think it was just a little too hard for my tastes. The bosses were very tough and the overall atmosphere was bland.

Cartridge Games: I kinda like it more than Super Mario World, but the game mainly made people play Kirby more and play Star Wars more.

~!~What's your favorite way to play a game?

Deleted member 46641: So I've been playing a lot of Hollow Knight (I have a theory on why its roguelike-like and it's actually really good), and I recently started The Witcher 3. I'm thinking I've finally got it down...
I've beaten the first Tower of Latria (who I'm not very good at) and really enjoy the combat.
But I've got a problem: I don't like the way the game controls. I've tried several runs and I'm still getting defeat-deaths everywhere. One run has the same enemy but it's faster, another has the same guard, another has the same trap but it's harder, etc.
It's a game where you die a lot, but you have points that you can use to buy better enemies. The problem is, I'm still in love with just fighting the same enemies over and over.
I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do by the game, but I see it's beatable with a guide. I've got to kill the same mini-boss a few times, but then I have to get through the same path several times.
I've done a few runs where I die a lot, but I always end up back at the end of my game, so I'm not sure if that's supposed to count.
Like what's your favorite way to play a game?
-----
BillFromAccounting: Play the game in the easiest to play sense. The game is for those that want to get hard to play as fast. Not the ones that want to wait for the perfect collectathon.
-----
B.K.: 100% in the best way possible.
I like the idea of play through the first level, then go back to the second level, and then back to the third level, and so on.
-----
Richter1887: I just do the easy stuff every now and then. I don't mind dying or grinding as much.
-----
SuperiorTrashTalk: I love to play the game in the easiest to play sense. I don't like dying because I know there's a fire in the sky and I have to burn it all down. I just like to get good at the game and figure it out.

Lyrick: I had to do a lot of these in the

~!~What’s the most recent title you’ve bought that skipped you, and you haven’t played much yet?

Masterspeed: I bought The Last of Us and The Legend of Zelda at launch, but I was gonna get around to playing both eventually. I was gonna get Last of Us 2 for the PS4, but I ended up getting a Switch since I missed Hyrule Warriors. I bought Horizon at launch and never played it. I heard it was mediocre. Bought Last Guardian and I haven’t played it since. I was hoping for a sequel because of course I did. Bought a PS4 last year and haven’t played it yet. The only time I see any game on the PS Store with a digital release is when they mentioned that they’d port over content to the digital version. I haven’t played it in a while.
So, I wanna ask your most recent purchase decisions. What’s your favorite game you haven’t played yet, and why?
-----
Finale Fireworker: I think I actually bought The Last of Us. I think it was the first game I played on launch, on PS3. I had always wanted to try it out, but I didn't have any friends to play it with, so that's why it started as my first experience. I didn't even always have a PS3 so I was able to buy it. I also really wanted to love it, but it's just too scary for me.
-----
Ada: Probably the only one I've played. I thought it was the best game ever and it just had amazing music. I got a Switch a year later and haven't played it since.
-----
jwhit28: Last of Us. Bought it for the first time because of my friends discovering it and it was great and I’m not ashamed to boot it up and see what happens.
-----
Masterspeed: I was too young, too young. I only played it once and that's it. I'm not ashamed to show it to my friends and have them play it. I played it to death and it was so much fun. I really wanted to see what happened to the characters but it's all just too scary in the way it affects them.

~!~Let's talk about why a game should be nominated for best Direction or facial/other animation of a character

The era of Luigi: Basically, let's start with a game that is well known and loved and then one that you feel was better received than all its contemporaries.
The most famous game of this era was God of War 2. It won many awards but the art direction is still unmatched.
Here is to people who have never played the game:
This is the most famous one.
This is one of the first examples of this trend.

~!~Why is it clear Silent Hill 4 has a place in the hearts of Soulsborne fans?

Spring-Loaded: This is the thread that I've been meaning to make this thread for a little bit, but I've been meaning to re-read the first game's fan likes and maybe try and understand what fans of that games would love to see in a sequel.
What I want to know is why it's clear Silent Hill 4 has a place in the hearts of Soulsborne fans?
I have played the original and Covenant on PS1 and it always struck me as a very unique game. From the setting to the characters, the themes, the atmosphere, and the music, I feel like it has a place in the hearts of Soulsborne fans.
It seems like it's been a consistent trend for the series, and I feel like that's reflected in the final games. In the case of Silent Hill 4, I feel it's due to the fact that it's the first game in the series that feels like it has a place in the hearts of Soulsborne fans. The apocalyptic hellscape has always felt alien to the original and it feels out of place. It's only when you start the game that you realise that.
That said, I think it's very likely that the final game will be closer to the earlier versions of Silent Hill 2 and 3, and the affinity system of the enemies, the level design, and the narrative could all be better. The game's style of survival horror could work in that regard, but I'd be glad to see a sequel make some progress on those fronts.
-----
lodger: Because I find it very hard to understand the Souls fanbase when they say Silent Hill 2 is closer closer to Nioh.
-----
Giever: I mean, Silent Hill 2 is pretty much closer to the earlier games in the series than I expected. But I also am not sure I could put into my mind that Silent Hill 4 was closer to Covenant on PS3.
-----
Zurick: I think the way I see it is a Soulslike game, with the cycle of rebirth and death cycle.
-----
Aswitch: It's not that hard to see. It's just that I can't understand it's fans. Particularly with 4 in the series. Its fans are very to overly obsessed with the past and what makes sense for it. I also find it difficult to follow it's

~!~Could the new Pokemon be based on Sacred Island from Unova?

Crazy Izanagi: So it’s been a while since we’ve seen anything about it in the anime and I’m wondering if it’s possible. I’ve always been fascinated with the area and even dug it’s history.
From what I’ve pieced it appears to be part of a large temple or area of ancient China. From what I’ve been able to gather Unova has something similar to that area which can be found in the history of ancient China.
I’m wondering if the locations I draw most of the people to are based on that region or if it’s more likely to be a coincidence.
Please let’s discuss.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Yes, China is big enough as is
-----
Kamiyouni: I mean, I'm sure they can. Maybe a first person.
-----
Sagadego17: yes
-----
Cronogear: If this is the case, then they should migrate the art of excision and refinement to make a game more like the originals.
-----
Cronogear: I believe this is what I'm implying. I'm sure they could, maybe they couldn't due to the high demands they had to make.
-----
WrenchNinja: I was hoping the Unova temples were based on the area in FFX.
-----
Cronogear: Ah, I know! I forgot all about that!
-----
Cronogear: I'm not sure if that's the case.
-----
Cronogear: They could have added some interesting stuff to the area like statues, statues with different trinoes, and even different animal parts to speak of. They could have added some more animals to the areas, as well.

~!~How would you feel if Microsoft created a streaming service for Xbox One X that operates and supports natively on an Xbox One console?

VirtuaRacer: The benefits of Microsoft trying something different is plain to see. The Xbox One X will likely be supported natively on an Xbox One through a streaming service, and streaming will be an added bonus. I'd love to see a Xbox One X Game Pass offering, but I think this is the first time in a long time that a game service would be something the Xbox brand can stand out among. I think Microsoft can go a long way with this.
Any thoughts?
-----
Troll: First party games would cut it in half.
-----
ManaByte: I wish they would try and make it something they say, or something that it's their slogan, something they do.
-----
Mitsurugi: Yeah, it’s weird they are doing it on a console with better specs and time. I imagine it’s going to be very taxing and it will be nice to have the freedom to stream your games on the One.
-----
G_Shumi: I wish. There are so many issues with the Xbox One X and it's definitely not a simple solution. I'm very pleased that they are able to offer it on an all-console box.
-----
Wonderbrah: It would help if they released it on the Switch.
-----
VirtuaRacer: I don't think it's a simple solution. Valve needs to create some guidelines or requirements or whatever to get the streaming service on the system. I think Microsoft has a lot of experience in this, Microsoft in particular.
-----
Kazoku_: I'm all for local chat. Just not on a console that can stream.
-----
Cronus: It would be a huge hit to my wallet. 
Though I expect it to run better than the One.
-----
VanCityGamer: I don't see how streaming is a requirement for this. Streaming is great for games on consoles, but how would streaming even work? Would it work?

====================
~!~What are your favorite and least favorite of the "open world" genre?

Van Bur3: We have about 5 open world games this year, but let's not start with that.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
The Open World is Zelda's bread and butter in this genre. The world is vast and beautiful, exploration is rewarding, items are varied, the enemies you face can all be various and affect us in a multitude of ways. It's all so well crafted and yet so incredibly simple and shallow. The game is fast, snappy, and easy, yet the sense of dread that I felt from the world and its puzzles was unparalleled by any other open world title. 
Assassin's Creed Odyssey
While initially I thought this game was going to be open world, Ubisoft reversed that course and really nailed the feeling of a welcome in and of itself. The main reason for this is because this game has always been about assassins creed heroes. We are used to seeing them as hoods, white heroes with their own stories and ideals crossed out into the reality of the game world. Yet, ACs white savior, Ezio, was an entirely different kind of protagonist. He was a member of a small, but noble guild called The Templars. He is the son of a legendary warrior who was trained in the use of magic by the legendary duo of Uldren and Raquel Cordain. He is the first Assassin to be so trained and why he is now working for the Templars is a traditional evil to begin with. He uses magic and ninjitsu skills, and his quirk for swords makes him a great assassin compared to the more more familiar characters like Bayek and Geralt. ACs protagonist Aang and Aang's mother Katherine is of a very select and talented group of people who all have great aspirations and a significant amount of magical power atm. 
Assassin's Creed Odyssey
The main characters of Assassin's Creed are a great bunch and they all have their own unique stories. We can take a look at some of the side quests, the Templars quests, and the various evil activities that Aang and Aang is doing. We can talk about the main story and origins of the Ezio and Bayek, bad ending, the bad endings, the evil ghost story, etc. We can take a look at some of the side stories that Aang and Aang does, we can take a

Phantom Thief: I would argue that Doom and Fortnite are games Microsoft could run on their Shield TV, but I don't think they'll be on the Switch.
-----
Windu: Microsoft is definitely not gonna let Nintendo have the Switch console. They have been too close friends with Nintendo with the Gamecube and 360. I think in the near future they will let Microsoft have the Switch, but they don't have the hardware to support their ecosystem. 
I want to believe on the other hand I think that Microsoft is gonna win this and that will make it all better.

-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah.

Windu: I think this is actually happening now lol. MS may be pushing this hard, but they don't have the hardware to make it happen. Microsoft however, has the hardware to port their games to Switch and it's not their decision to support the Switch.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don't think it's a smart strategy by any means, but I'm really hoping Microsoft doesn't pull the party-line and just allows them to go all-in with the Chromecast port. The other issue is that I'm not really convinced that this is a good idea at all.

Phantom Thief: I think he means the fact that the X1X supports the Netflix cloud-like streaming service.

~!~PS4 Pro getting Bluetooth Audio to Bluetooth Adapter

Shao Kahn: I’m making the same change in the past year or so. I’ve noticed that the PS4 Pro supports Bluetooth Audio to Bluetooth adapter, and it’s actually Bluetooth Patent pending.
From the article:
[UPDATE]: Ars Technica Article
Original Source
I’ve been trying to replicate this to other devices, and it’s funny because the PS4 Pro is getting Bluetooth Audio now. It’s a patent that should be licensed by now, but alas no one has licensed it.
It’s a bit concerning for sure, but the short version is that Sony has licensed the Bluetooth API from the Bluetooth standard.
I’m not against patenting (as I said I have already patented 10 separate patents dating from 2013), but I just don’t know how similar this would work to other devices.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Is this exactly how the new Pro doesn't work with Bluetooth?

It's that Nintendo's in a position right now to make a big deal about Switch Online, and now it's not working.
These things are expected to be released in the next few days and we know that, so expectations will drop quite fast.

Joe: I had no idea we were at that point.

~!~What is the best way to track your gaming newsfeed?

KrigareN-: My feed is pretty extensive but I only have 3 apps (besides the usual Nintendo, Sony and GamePro stuff) where I have 1 feed that I subscribe to. 
I've found the best ways I can track it is using Twitter, but also using Drop Next, which is a service that pulls out a lot of news for a single subscription. I also follow a couple of websites daily and never actually pay for it, but I do subscribe for Drop Next. 
I've also tried doing a bit of Googling and I see that Drop Next isn't available anywhere. 
Any suggestions? I'm in the UK, so I'd love to take advantage of the cheaper prices in the US.
-----
Defective: Drop Next is fantastic
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Drop Next is amazing!
-----
Oinone: Drop Next for the content, not so much the functionality.
-----
KrigareN-: Yeah, the feature list is immense. Such a fun and useful service. 
I have my Twitter and Reddit feeds pretty packed up now, but you can probably fit a few other sites and forums just in the background.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I've never even installed the service before, I thought you meant one of the gaming services.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Twitch
-----
NarohDethan: Drop Next is amazing and it's worth it, just watch your feed and list it, it'll be enough for you.
-----
Starlatine: Pardon my ignorance I somehow didn't even know this existed exists, I have had zero idea what it's really like dude.
Sounds amazing.

KrigareN-: Drop Next + Twitch, this is a treat. :)

~!~Those who bought the Switch version of Resident Evil 2 remake, how do you feel about the next RE game?

theofficefan99: This is my opinion, I'm in.
I've been playing RE2 since the first game and have played it (I'm almost level 25) and I'm loving it. It's still RE4 in a sense, but more so because it's the first one.
I've heard RE5 and 6 are better, but I don't know if they'll be the same kind of horror experience as the 2nd one. I have a hard time deciding between them.
I really hope they improve on the pace of the game. There's a lot to do and there's a lot of rooms to explore, but I feel it's too long a game. It's not very long either, so I would like to finish it in one sitting. 
I've heard RE6 is a lot better than the first one, but I haven't even finished 6 yet.
Do you guys think the next RE game will be better?
-----
Cokomon: I actually played a lot of the first RE2 and loved it. I'm still not over how the story wrapped itself. RE6 is a much better game, but I think it's gonna be way longer.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: I don’t really think it’s necessarily better. RE2 and 3 are more focused on the main story and less on mindshare and more on exploring. 4 was a complete mess, and the third had some bad decisions with pacing and story. 5 turned out to be a full on RE4 with a better antagonist system and a few new mechanics but it still had a lot of what people loved.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think it’s better overall, with a few exceptions. RE2 and RE3 are great, but RE4 is in a much worse spot and everyone should play that.
-----
Strangelove77: It’s worse. There’s a reason why REmake 2 exists.
-----
Nocturnowl: I've been enjoying the game far more than I thought, 6 being a big downgrade made me a worse person overall as well.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I hated it. It was too action-oriented for me.
-----
Fancy Clown: I don

~!~Game Pass: What if Microsoft signed a deal with EA to allow subscription services on Xbox One?

Theorry: Basically. Yes, they have it on PC also but that is not really a big deal. So what if they offered games for free to play? 
No shit like that.
-----
Theorry: Microsoft would be perfect for it. They have the best marketing strategy for their upcoming games.
-----
Kubricks: Gamepass for you. That's what I will.

~!~Why it's been a bad month for fighting games?

JayWood2010: I'm just wondering why it's been a bad month for fighting games here in the UK. Fighting games usually don't get much promotion outside of a few months in the early going. I'm not even talking about a few months in September as well, but rather like six months in the summer here in the UK. Fighting games usually don't get much promotion outside of a few random announcements at e3s and Smash events. I'm not even sure if it's because the games aren't making much money or not, but I'm just curious as to why it's been this month for fighting games here in the UK.
I was curious to see what people's thoughts on it has been. I'm sure most here men its because its not often people are talking about what they play and what they want out of fighting games. Also I know its mostly people who play fighting games, but I don't think I talk about the actual game as well, or at least I have to think.
-----
Dio Over Heaven: It's not really that bad.
-----
TheBaldwin: The bad month what so not?
-----
Zerokingx: I love fighting games and since the usual fighter trailers are the same no fighting game has had a better month.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Fighting games are probably the biggest reason why it's a bad month for me. I'm fairly certain I'm in the middle of peak territory with MK, SFV, and DBFZ.
I think it's only been in January now, but I feel like it's been in a decline since EVO came out.
-----
texhnolyze: I'm mostly a fan of fighting games. I play fighting games every month. I even play many PC games like Overwatch whenever I play them. It's been a regular part of my gaming past month.
-----
Sgtpepper89: I enjoyed it a lot actually. Combat feels great in MP and the roster is big with the new heroes. I also like the way you can customize your character.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Pretty much this.
-----
Gegz: I played a lot, but ofcourse it was much more than I expected, specially when I thought for sure that it'll be the biggest fighting game in 2019.

~!~What do you want from the next Doom game?

UnluckyKate: I thought some of you would be into the idea of a Doom game with spooky demons and space demons, but I havent started thinking about what you would like from such a game. 
I have a few suggestions:
New Hard mode, where you can shoot demons, or jump them up a ramp, and you can choose to go back up(it is a mode).
New Plasma Launcher, where you can revive yourself and Quake
New Plasma Gun, where you can shoot long distances and Quake doubles.
New Shotgun, where you can shoot small projectiles and Quake doubles.
So what about you guys and gals?
-----
Hudo: Something like Doom 2016.
-----
Kindekuma: I would want a new Doom game that is more like the original games. I mean, come back when they made Doom 3, and I played the original game, so yes.
-----
MrH: The locations and the gameplay is more like the original, but the story, setting and atmosphere are better.
-----
The Living Tribunal: Everything is going to be like Doom 2016.
-----
Gevurztraminer: I'd like a new Doom game that has some more Lovecraftian horror elements, with the spooky atmosphere and the sound design of Doom 2016.
-----
TheFireman: Something more inspired by Alien Isolation. That shit is terrifying.
-----
Eolz: Whatever works first and leaves behind bad taste later.
-----
SurrenderDorothy: Something more inspired by Alien Isolation.
-----
xChildofhatex: Personally, I want a new Doom game to be like Doom and Wolfenstein, where the spooky atmosphere is used to great effect.

Socrates: I’m getting back into Hollow Knight this week and... I’m not sure if I want to play another game.
I know it’s an old game, but I came to it thinking, “I can get lost and I don’t have to worry about time or money”.
I wanna play with a group (which is only 2 people but is expanded upon. Here is my group).
I’ve been playing on and off on Hollow Knight since 2001, and I love it.
I’ve played and come up with my own top 15 best ways to experience Hollow Knight.
I’m interested in any tips and tricks I can offer, and am open to suggestions.
I’m also interested in any helpful tips and tricks that I can share in the OT.
-----
Sou Da: You're looking for Hollow Knight.
-----
kaisere: You can play it on either Steam or the Vita, but HK is a lot more accessible and more laid back.
I just wish you luck with the purchases.

Sou Da: This is a great tip man. It's the one of the best games I've ever played, and the atmosphere it has is unmatched in any game I've played.

Theorry: I know its a new one but I dont know if this one new kinda new at all. 
"This is the kind of entertainment I would not get if I was a girl" is not a phrase I heard growing up but it doesnt mean I dont know how to say it. It has become a meme now. You see this every week or a few weeks or you dont know. Its like a new Netflix show or a new show excuse and thats it. Its just a meme now. 
Its like nothing i thought of. I dont even know what kind of entertainment this is or how to say it. And thats not even getting better. There is no better feeling than seeing someone having a good time alone.

~!~Catherine: Full Body - Review Thread

Caim: I'm sure many of you have already seen this and are ready for the best Persona experience. To those of you who don't know, Catherine is a visual novel developed by the Persona team in collaboration with Atlus. The game features a cast of mostly high-school and High SchoolER students that you can take to the most amazing city and slice-of-life in the game! There's even a story that you can follow! You'll need to create your own social links and summon friends to help you along your adventure.
The story is classified but it's pretty short so I imagine that we'll be waiting for a few more reviews.

~!~Garry's Mod (RTS) was brilliant and influential in making RTS games successful

More_Badass: I think Garry's Mod is one of the best games ever made, and it's probably the best "simulation" RTS that I've played. But one thing that I find lacking is the focus or "sandbox" aspects. It seems that all these "RTS devs" are all over the place and feel like they have nothing to talk about. They all seem to have the singular focus on the game-planning, and nothing to really do while grinding for shit.
This is a response to one of my favorite things about the Civilization games. The way every civilization and city-state grow, the economies change, the story changes, the economy changes, the players change, and the games themselves are perfect. It's one of the main reasons why they all play the same exact exact exact exact race at the same exact exact exact spot in the space. It's a completely emergent gameplay experience even without the focus of the game itself.

~!~Has anyone played the Binding of Isaac Rebirth?

TheFallenSaboteur: I've yet to play it, but I am very interested in playing it. I know Isaac has his own story and I know it's more Isaac than Isaac Rebirth, but I have no idea if Isaac has any story in the game, and I don't think I have.
Is anyone here played it? How does it compare to Isaac Rebirth? Any ideas?
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I haven't played Isaac Rebirth, but I heard the story is pretty different in it's plot.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: If it had to do with Isaac Rebirth I'd say it's pretty much the difference. Unlike Isaac Rebirth, it's far more tightly designed than it is Isaac.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: In that sense I do love it quite a bit (and I do love the story in Isaac Rebirth too). I feel like if it had been more polished and if they had taken some of the more mechanical ideas and brought more of them on-board, this would have been a much different game.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: What does Rebirth stand for?
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: It's a more traditional Isaac story. Isaac is haunted by malformed, broken, and occult things, to which he tries to get rid of. It has a certain "adventure" vibe I think. Rebirth has a similar "survival adventure," with you going back to the past to see what's there. Rebirth is similar, but it's much slower in terms of story.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I love this game. I know the story is a bit slower than Rebirth, but I can forgive that. It's not like Isaac is completely invincible, but he's still vulnerable to fire and poison.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: Don't know if this is a valid question though lol. I'm pretty sure that you can't get the item you want in the item box in Rebirth either. The items you can get in this game are more limited in item variety and better at least get a certain item in a certain category than Isaac.

~!~The Witcher 3 has "Tougher Than I remembered!!!"

Huggy: I was playing the Witcher 3 a week ago and I was shocked to see that most people don't think the game is that much of aougass.
It's not like there's a lot to do in the game and it's a linear game. You can't really do much side quests besides walking around getting companions a drink and talk to a cutscene.
The best side quests are the one's you only get anywhere and during that you go through conversations with companions that talk about what they want to do, what they do, what they want to do.
It's amazing, and I absolutely love Witcher 3. It's a game I constantly feel like I'm playing for the story, and I'm glad I decided to go through it, because I think it's one of the best experiences in gaming.
-----
Raiden: I had this thought the other day and it dawned on me...
This game is just so much fun.
-----
TheRaidenPT: I wish I could be like this :(
I remember enjoying it the most from top to bottom.
-----
SupremeWu: I don't get how the story is told, they just kind of let you have it to begin with. The one thing that's different about the others is how the game doesn't pick up from point A to point B. I feel like the story is centered on the main character A.
-----
Memento: Amazing game.
Even though the quests are a bit longer than other open world games.
-----
Mondy: I'm pretty sure it picks up pretty early in the game and continues throughout the story. There's no need to rush through every single quest to get to the actual meat of the game. Just go with whatever path suits you.
-----
Khezu: I remember this being the case.
I had a similar experience the other day. I was a character in Witcher 3 that had barely touched his first big quest. I had done all the side quests and side dungeons and so I wasn't ready to say goodbye to him yet.
I asked a couple guys in the party, who were a bit drunk, to walk me through the main town. When I asked them, who is the guy you're supposed to go to the bar with? They said it was because I was busy

~!~Has anyone else gone through a year?

SleepSmasher: I've had my Switch for about a month and a half now and have gone through a year. I've recently purchased a Switch and I've been addicted to it.
I must say, with the price of new games in July dropping to $60 at the same time, I've thought I'd go through a year of drought. But, I've gone through one year of this price drop as well.
Have you guys gone through a year like that this year?
-----
Deleted member 9145: I’ve never

DarthWalden: I had a year when I bought a Switch, I didn’t need it for the first 2 months but after that I got it again for a couple more months and loved it.

Vanillalite: I did for the first three months, it became more affordable.
-----
cw_sasuke: I mean yeah its not like you can spend hundreds of dollars for a year.

neon_dream: I don't have to go through a year. I'm just going through it. It's really good for the system.
I'll say that I was very happy with the system in terms of games. I felt like I was living the dream. But outside of that, I've not had a great experience with my Switch besides Smash and Mario Kart.
-----
Dyle: Yes, I was just browsing through my purchases on the eshop and realized I have yet to see a "year" worth of games for it. I'm happy I picked one up, but I wouldn't say it's a good experience.

~!~Why Do Games Cost That Much To Assume How Good It Is?

Memento: This is a question that has been running in my head for a few years now. It is especially prevalent in AAA games these days.
I am a big fan of games with a good upgrade and/or polish. I think it is important to understand that most AAA games are still being made in an engine heavy style.
Resogun, The Technomancer, Fallout 4, Dragon Age Origins, Shadow of the Tomb Raider etc etc. Some examples I came up with.
-----
chandoog:

Lant_War: I was going to say Shadow of the Tomb Raider. You should really read what I said exactly.

Stiler: Because most stuff in games are supposed to be pretty good and polished, and usually have very good and unique features.

~!~What was the first game you played in the series?

SolVanderlyn: I am kind of a old one, but I was last year's generation's generation, so I started with Resident Evil 4.
I like RE4 a lot, and it's my favorite classic horror game. I feel like this is a game I should've started sooner, since it's really fun to play. My first experience with this series was back in the Super Famicom days, on my first playthrough of RE4.
I was super excited, since I had been playing it for a long time, and the first thing I realized was, it's actually my first time actually playing this game, and I think my first impression was really, really good. I think this is one of the best games of this era, and I have a lot of fun with it every now and then.
What was it that finally made me play this game?
I borrowed it from my older brother, and I was really excited to get back into it. I was so excited, I started playing in a school playroom, but the controls made it hard to play. I just couldn't handle the controls.
I'm only like two or three hours in, and my first impression was really bad:
It's hard to tell what's going on inside this game. I can't figure out how to tell what's going on, because there's so much information, but in the middle of my thoughts, I can barely figure out how to move pieces.
So, the game is about eight minutes long, and it's very simple. You're solving puzzles, you're finding information about what is happening, and you're finally confronted by a new creature.
It's an okay game, and it's still a remake of a classic, but it takes something from RE4, and makes it awesome.
The camera, while not great, is still pretty good. It's nice still, but it's a work of art, so it's not like it's ruined by some crazy gunplay nonsense.
The gameplay is fun, and it's very rewarding when you finally solve the puzzles.
The game feels very slow, and the puzzles are very repetitive. The only real change from RE4 is the pacing of the game, and that's kinda much standard fare these days.
The bosses and story are interesting.
But, it wasn't all that it

~!~Crossing Souls/Souls paths (or where to start them)

Ryouji Gunblade: As a child I had to learn the language of Miyazaki directed games and language skills in order to play the games. I was born in Japan to speak English but when I was young I learned to read and write on the language. I was at school when I was born the only language I knew was Japanese and when I entered the school I was greeted with a message about the PS4 port being exclusive to Japan, followed by the rumor that the game was being developed by the developers of Souls. I was like, "this is really weird and I'm proud of myself.". I had to learn the language and English language. But I never did finish it. I thought about it, and ended up loving the game but it took me until the first NieR games(s) to play them on PS3. I was so into them in high school and entering college and I really loved the high school atmosphere and the music. I played the first NieR game(s) countless times(s) and it was one of my favorite experiences of all time. I really want to understand what happened between Miyazaki and FROM.
I have two questions:
- Where and when should I start learning the lore?
- Any other good cross-over games?
-----
lunarwhale: Started playing Dark Souls this summer after a couple of years in a foreign country when I was a 4 year old. I love this game, and have some questions:
- Where to start with the lore?
- Is there a set of rules for each section or something to help the learning curve?
- Is there a set of commonly accepted rules for each section?
- Is there a walkthrough to go through the game?
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: Yeah I started off with some in English, and then I went to Japanese. I was so lost at the beginning, but I ended up liking it. I think it might be worth starting with that. Thanks for that!
-----
Lant_War: No Spanish, I guess
-----
Heckler456: How far in advance do you read the game? You don't want to start over, it's best to start right after anyway. Would say start at the very beginning, and then jump right into the middle.

~!~Nintendo E3 2018 Online Service Announcement

SinCItyAssassin: Nintendo E3 is in a weird place, it seems. We don't have a dedicated site for this. 
We had a thread on this year’s E3, we had a thread every year since 2013 and even that one was filled with shit.
We’re really trying to ship a Nintendo online service that's deep and full of content and support the service from beginning to end. It’s going to be a huge disappointment for many of you who are genuinely waiting for this.
Here’s hoping that it’s not as bad as what was planned.
-----
Wander: I expect a Direct in about a month and some Smash news.
-----
Kouriozan: Yeah, sorry about that one.
-----
Dingens: really hoping Nintendo does a live direct this time or online service reveal, it's been delayed twice now.
-----
Cartridge Games: Would be nice if it was just a recap of the E3, but it’s probably not.
I’m guessing it’ll be a direct like last year and some more details on Smash and Nintendo’s E3, but I haven’t heard anything confirm this time round so far
-----
DarthWalden: A lot of these things just get canceled. I hope Nintendo is done with the E3 madness and we can get some new announcements.
-----
gameongreggy: I really hope that Nintendo goes big with new online services on the regular E3 to get the service out before the March Direct. Splatoon 2 is a perfect same day game, and that's just what I want to play online.
-----
Oheao: Hopefully, they'll announce the date for the online service soon. I don't think it's plan anymore though. I hope they just announce it next year, it's been a while since they had one.
-----
SinCItyAssassin: Yeah, I’m hoping they just keep the online service going until next year.

~!~[STORMD] The Next DEATH BATTLE: Revenge and Control (PS4/XBO)

HueyFreeman: Sony is making a DEATH BATTLE - Revenge - on the back of a pre-BATTLE announcement that was originally going to be a PS4 exclusive. The story of a young man who goes on a quest to find revenge against the failed Death Star recruit Shocker from the first game.
If you don't know - Death Star is the first game in the Shadowgun franchise. Essentially, this means that any time you appear on the boards of Death Star, you will be stripped of your keychain and have no access to the story or choices it has ever provided. Basically, if you don't play the game, you are going to be stripped of the keychain and the choices you have no access to will not be changed. This is pretty cool - I don't think there is a PS4 version of Death Star that isn't backwards compatible on Xbox One - but I don't think that's the only difference.
The story (and choices) in the game are going to be different. You will be given a choice as you can play the story as you please. You can choose to be the bad guy, he is not worthy of the title of Death Star's player. You will be given a lot of options to choose from that you can go with. You can go the Ishimura stage, or the Genocide stage. You can also choose to not play at all, and you can lose your weapon or experience that if you use it from the start, you will lose a ton of options to play the story.
There is some spoilers in this post for the first time too - here's a warning for people who haven't played the game (I'm playing on the PS4 version)
-----
RyougaSaotome: I'm a bit underwhelmed by the first one, but I love the second one.
As much as I don't want to play it, I just can't get enough of HCS doing what Naughty Dog's shooting gallery has done for the past two games: reticle shadows, and some kind of artistic control.

~!~Resident Evil 2 Ver. 5 theme song parodies classic tropes in first-person

SolVanderlyn: The Resident Evil 2 Ver. 5 theme song is really good. It's got a great "poison" claim, and a melodic exterior.
I think it's time for Capcom to do a new game that is both first-person and third-person. The formula that Residence broke me out of was this:
Would like to hear more. I do like the "poison claim" at the end.
Also, check out this song that plays during the credits.
-----
Tonton: I always find these songs more fun when they use familiar tropes and themes
-----
Pikachu: Would be cool to hear something from a franchise that I haven’t heard before
-----
TheMoon: It's not a RE2 "Song"
-----
SolVanderlyn: What a sick song.
-----
The Booktastic Bus: I still find this song to be the most relevant song in the entire franchise.
It reminds me of the classic Metal Gear songs.
-----
SofNascimento: I remember hearing about this in the Resident Evil Music Podcasts thread. I remember loving the song and started to listen to it in one of the RE2 Music Podcasts.
I recently re-watched the whole OST thing and I am completely in love now.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Haha, the perfect fit.

~!~What's Your Favourite Favourite Video Game Title?

TheGamingNewsGuy: With all the heat things get in the moment and the game being a time sink we can always go back to another favourite title we had before we get to enjoy more of it
So my question is what is your favourite title that has you going back to it or evoking an nostalgia trip.
For me it would be the GTA Series. I remember there was a hype up for the game at the time and the title immediately sprang to mind. I remember this being coming as a surprise to me and I enjoyed the title a lot. I also remember this being the title I remember playing the most as a kid. I remember liking it, liked it so much I knew it was special but I knew it was not for me. I didn't get it when it was first released but during the early-mid 90s I played the first title on the Gamecube and was pleasantly surprised by it. I also remembered liking the PS2 title but there was very little I had played in that period and it was on Gamecube VC back in the day so I guess I wasn't the only one.
-----
Syril: The obvious answer is Final Fantasy IV.
-----
mrmickfran: You just had to post the wii game
Edit: Forgot the Wii title
-----

FluxWaveZ: Atlus games, honestly.
-----
Cess007: The NES title was Sonic 3D.
-----
Strings: It's been a while since I played them, so I'll say it for out of the loop.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I hope so, I have yet to play FF IV, and I think we will get another FF IV this year (depending if it's Last Guardian or Phantasy Star IV)
-----
FluxWaveZ: It's been about ten years since I've played Final Fantasy IV. I remember thinking about the game when I was younger, and how amazing it was to finally beat all of the bosses. But I've got nothing on the NES, and I'm really hoping to play it soon, lol.

TheGamingNewsGuy: Not at all, the game is great but it's not that bad imo

-----
vestan: I mean, IMO they're just going to get the Switch game out, we're not getting anything else like that.
I'd say it's likely that they're just going to get whatever they have for the platform, it's hard to predict how they'll adapt to the market, but it's possible they'll do what they did with the 360.
-----
ZhugeEX: If they decide to release an Xbox One in the future, they'd do an Xbox 360 emulator and just call it xCloud.
If they decide to release a Xbox One S in the future, it will be Game Pass. It's the same for PS4 and Switch.
-----
z0m3le: I mean, a bunch of my guesswork is working, but it is all kinda probably with Microsoft, I don't think they would ever use it for anything other than what is currently in the works and planned, so I'm not sure what they could do.
-----
Fergie: I can't see them doing anything else.
-----
op_ivy: most likely emulator
-----
FairyEmpire: I really don't see how the Xbox One would be considered a successor to the PS4. Apart from the obvious backwards compatibility issues, I don't think they'd use anything more than their current "portable" design, which basically boils down to putting those 3D cameras in the controller. It's not like they could make a better controller that just uses 3D cameras or some other weird gimmick, but for the moment I can't see them making a PC out of something like that and I guess they never have. We'll see what happens, I suppose.

~!~The Joy of Being Able to Tailor Your Experience

osnameless: This is something I've noticed in many of my many gaming picks.
The more games you can choose, the easier it will be to pick up and experiment.
It is a thought that I really like, and one that I really can't for the life of me fix. That being said, it is something that I personally find difficult to balance in many of my gaming playing days.
So, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the idea that it's difficult to balance in this kind of game.
The thought that it's difficult to balance, and I shouldn't make this thread for anyone who is even slightly critical of this kind of game, please explain why you feel it is important to make a game that gives the player the option to prioritize which aspect of their experience they prefer.
I'm just curious if it's true that it makes people who want the best experience play less productive games, and if you'd like to see more games like this, how do you feel about it?
I would like to hear what you think.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I don't mind it at all, I don't like games that make me feel anything because I think I'm missing out on something, and I don't care about "bad" things in games, so I'm happy to tell myself as long as it's good.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don't mind it. I'm not even remotely interested in likes or dislikes, I just care about the experience and story and world.
-----
Aztechnology: I don't mind it. I get to enjoy the games I like pretty easily. I don't have to be good at all to be good at games.
-----
DarthWalden: The only way I can see myself playing a game like this is if I'm coming from some sort of RPG difficulty and being able to grind is amazing.
I can see myself playing this type of game as well.
-----
Masterspeed: I don't have to be good at every genre to be good. I can just play it and not mindlessly grind for hours.

~!~What’s the best way to find a good Buy/Sell Switch deal?

JayWood2010: I've always been a sucker for Nintendo stuff, especially the eShop eshop, and I was wondering what the best place to find this sort of stuff is. As a kid I never got into Nintendo, but I did get a chance to play some of the big shooters on the eshop.
I want to make sure this is a fun thread to engage everyone who bought a Switch.
I'm not much of a shooter person, but I like to play shooters, and I think there is a great deal on the eShop that can give me a similar experience. I have found a couple of cheap shooters, and one for the Switch, but I don't really feel like spending any money on it.
I wanted to get this for a while, but I've always had a problem of not being able to find a good deal on the eshop.
I wanted to ask if any of you guys have had a similar experiences finding a good buy deal on the Switch?
-----
TheMoon: It's not ideal but it can be done.
I've had a good number of times when shopping for a console, but never had the problem where I had a bad luck turn. It was on the store not registering and I didn't have the card in my hand, so it just came out that I had an OK luck-turn.

Which was the first online multiplayer game I ever played?
I know that you can download multiplayer games online, but why this first multiplayer game?
I've heard that this was a good idea at least, but I'm not sure if I'd play a "single-player" online multiplayer game.
Any other fun/your favorite multiplayer games you know?

hydrophilic attack: i liked it when i bought it for a few bucks on gog
-----
May: It's not my boita, but my reaction is a lot different. I'm glad I bought it for 20 eurobucks.
-----
Richter1887: It's amazing, but I wish it wasnt 60 instead of 60 because it is way too small and also way too big.
-----
zsynqx: It's my favorite, but I think 99% of the time I prefer 60 fps, and the 60fps is essential in the online multiplayer.
-----
Silfer: It's my least favorite. It's still very much wanted to be a good co-op game but it's gotten little to nothing in the last year. I've been trying to get into it since release and I think I'm finally gonna finish it today.
-----
purseowner: The best co-op game of 2018.
-----
Svart: I've been wanting to try it out.
Sucks it's probably not 60fps though.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: i really loved it, it had an 80's jank which was surprising, but i still really enjoyed it and i really liked the music.

Ferrio: I really loved it, but its only 60 fps. I'm glad i waited, i can wait until next year.

~!~I bought a PS4 Pro in August- October and I'm not sure when I'll receive it

Araujo: I've been a regular gamer since I'm 8, I love videogames and have a lot of free time on my hands. I bought my first PS4 when it came out in 2007 for Spider-man and I've been a gamer since...that? I can't remember.
Now, it's October 11th 2018 and I've just got my PS4 Pro to clean my system. I'm wondering when I'll get to it and why no one else does?
Any advice?
-----
Daytak: Buy one
If you don't feel like it then buy one
-----
Araujo: I have two reasons.
1. I have an unopened version of the PS4 that I'll be throwing away to reseal it for Christmas. I remember when it first came out, it was a black and white PS4 with some parts missing. I was able to play it a bit before i decided to sell it for a reasonable price. And the thing is, if I can't get my PS4 Pro (which I have not been able to do since then), then I won't be able to get my PS4 for another 2 years. I'm not even sure what I can do with all my gaming hardware and money.
2. It's definitely been a few years since I last moved into my new apartment and have had a chance to play in front of my beautiful 4K TV, that is an utter BLAST GRIND SMOOTH. I've had the white PS4 since I was a wee lad and the games I played were all white, I have a bit of colour in my head with the PS4 Headset too...
-----
Richter1887: Buy a Pro if you don't feel like getting one.
-----
Araujo: Hmm... I guess if I buy one and play a bit, I don't feel like going backwards in gaming. I guess I'll just play a bit more AAA games to fill the time.
-----
Tofer: Buy one. I have a red One X and have had many games fall a bit off the place.

~!~What are your favorite ps2 games?

ReyVGM: I've been replaying my ps2 backlog and finally finished my favorite ps2 game, Hyper Light Drifter.
It's been a long time since I've played a game in the style of a classic console game, but what a game. The level of quality is insane.
I remember thinking I'd love to play a ps2 game that looked like a ps1 game. The first time I found myself in that dark dungeon was one of the best experiences I ever had. It's not just the visuals or the art style, it's the challenge and challenge of the part two, and of course the gameplay.
I remember being so hyped for that game, but it was too much. It felt very overrated, and it sucks, because the gameplay is still spot on even without a full RPG. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it as much as I did, but that's because it's a classic JRPG.
It was only when I heard of the game that I knew it was a classic. That's why I got so hyped for it.
I haven't played many ps2 games, or even games in the style of a classic console game, but this one was one I wanted to experience for a long time. It's not even that the game itself is bad, it's just that the dungeon is just so huge and convoluted and full of secrets that you'd never really been presented any challenge if you stuck with it.
I really hope that we get another ps2 game that's like this, because Hyper Light Drifter was incredible. The way the magic works in that game is just incredible, and it really makes you feel like you're playing through the Zodiac Age, and not just a relic from a different era.

~!~Danadrax: I think the next entry in the WarCraft III series will finally be on par with the original and not by a massive margin, much less in terms of content.

Deleted member 1258: There's a lot of misinformation out there, but I think Danadrax's quick research has me firmly on board.
This game would've been the better, shorter experience of the IP versus a very long build.
That being said, I think the short play style of the IP would have been a very good fit for StarCraft.
I'm very interested in Blizzard's plans for a StarCraft IV.
-----
Silky: So you're telling me that this is the SC2 of WarCraft?
I didn't even think they made a short version of SC2 at all
-----
Mazzle: We all know the answer.
It's the best of the lot
-----
Cort: I think it would of been an easy 5€ with the 20% off. I don't think it would have done much business because there was a lot of competition and the IP is relatively valuable, but I don't think it would have even been worth the extra price.
-----
Zatoichi: This. I think the current SC gameplay/etwork of the IP is far more interesting. I think it doesn't have much of an identity.
-----
Deleted member 1258: LOL, that's kind of a weird take
-----
Mazzle: There's a reason why the WarCraft community is so negative to WoD right now. It's to pad the calendar that you have to play all year.
-----
Runner: There's a reason why WarCraft is dropped so often. It's a competitive-only game with a small following among players for the microtransaction shit.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I agree. To get a better grasp of how WarCraft works, read here: 
I know it's a "classic" IP, but it's still subpar in everything you listed. The balance is archaic, the custom games are trash, the RTS stuff didn't sell a damn ass.
-----
SuikerBrood: I don't think it's the best of the lot. It has a lot of potential but I'm not sure if it's all that much use.
I think a big problem for it is the control scheme.

~!~What if Kagemasa was a girl?

Araujo: This is the thread where you guys should discuss Kagemasa.
You know, for a lot of people including myself, an obvious one is that of a girl as an avatar.
What if a game character you like had a history, a background story, a story about, say, a zombie, a mysterious creature, a character you like, a playable character, a game character, a game character. For this, let's talk about a specific character that is in a specific franchise and show why they look similar, what makes that specific character special, and why it isn't common to see characters from different games.
Let's start with what we see in the trailer for God of War.
Spoiler: God of War trailer
The story is about Ares, the god of gods, and the protagonist, Kratos, having a child and bonding with him. The trailer reveals that Kratos conceived a child with one of the other gods. So as an adorization, it shows Ares having orgasms and becoming a daddy, but the issue is that it shows him having a child with a god.
Spoiler: God of War trailer
The story of the new God of War ends with
Spoiler: New God of War Trailer
The music of the new God of War is
Spoiler: Dancing around
So Kratos, the one adorning his body with the love, love and beauty of a new god, comes to life and gives birth to a child.
Spoiler: Dancing around
However, what you would think would happen is all the gods of the previous God of War would all be brought in a new one as well.
Now let's talk about the background story of God of War.
Spoiler: New God of War Trailer
Now this isn't a spoiler for God of War 4 since we know the story of the previous God of War, but its use of symbolism is pretty obvious, especially compared to its sequel. Imagine the following scenario

~!~What would you want out of the next AC?

quotethis: I've been thinking about this for a while. I remember the last time I really had an interest in a Assassin's Creed game was Black Flag/Freedom Cry. Then I picked up Freedom Cry for $10 and felt like I'd seen it enough. I made a deep play for myself and got to the part where you are playing as Senegalesque Bayard.
It's been a while, but I've always been fascinated by the setting of Assassin's Creed games. The setting has always been fresh and has a rich history. You have the setting of Ancient Egypt, the setting of a city Egypt, the setting of a pirate city, the setting of a pirate legend, the setting of the mythological creatures you can find, the culture you can find, the region you can find yourself as aano. It's just the setting of AC has always been a fresh and unique experience.
So, which of the 2 are you most excited for?
The one that actually has a place for you to explore the historical antecedent and the setting of the game you want to play.
-----
JaeCryo: Freedom Cry is a great game, but it's so different from AC because it's more about exploration than shooting. You could try the Ezio trilogy or Chronicles before Origins if you want, but I think both are great.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I honestly think the answer is just to go back to Origins, since you play as Ezio's son and he's helping you out by helping you out by hinting that you're the son of a Spartan.
-----
Bhonar: I always thought that this is the one that would be the most "Origins"
-----
TheBaldwin: I don't think you can go back even after syndicate. 
Origins has that untouchable feeling. 
But I really think something that makes origins feel fresh and unique is the setting.
You get this sense of a city or neighborhood that is a sort of setting in an historical urban setting. 
And the setting itself is very fresh and unique. 
But I think the one downside of origins being so fresh is that it feels really cold. 
So I would say to go back in. 
I have played everything up to origins, but I am hoping to play synd

~!~The Jimquisition - What BioWare Should Done For You

Phantom Thief: SOURCE
BioWare has a long history of shitting out their beds before the call is call; I agree with this, and I think it’s a point I think people are making. 
I actually think they should speak more about crunch and working conditions outside of the company, as opposed to just saying it, and maybe doing something about it. That would actually be a huge step forward for the industry, and I think we need to see more of this in the future. 
I’d like to hear what you guys think.
-----
LewieP: I mean, I believe EA has the most strict crunch plans.
-----
JaeCryo: It's a true staple of consumer ethics.
-----
Cartridge Games: Says it all for a corporate CEO like Walid.
The CEO should do everything in his power to avoid crunch, but it’s not some magic-enjoy vacation.
People need to learn ASAP.
-----
Razgriz417: agree, would just be mandatory crunchpucking for any job
-----
AxeVince: I mean, if the employee is doing everything in his power to avoid crunch, that's on the employee.
If they're on crunch, he/she should probably be on it because it's either done by a human or someone from EA.

Lopez: EA is awful

~!~[Mysterious new gaming related charity/game-passing scam]

TeddyShardik: I've been a charity fan since 2012, where I worked on games and charity for fun, but I missed out on a lot of great stuff from that time. It's still an official charity in my heart and I did get some cool games for free, but I've always been a bit bummed that I've missed out on so much stuff from that time.
I'm referring to this scam from the late 2010s that was used to get super exposure on gamespassing sites. It's not necessary to contact me about the scam, but I use my own money and opportunities to get games and not pay anything.
I called a few people to let them know about the scam, but they didn't care, and they've made no suggestions or anything.
After 3 years, they haven't contacted me, so I'm passing them on this is all a scam to them.
-----
Pikagreg: I am only familiar with the website that used to charge my registered charity game pass monthly subscription for 2 years for 1 game but a few years ago it changed their mind. Will give them a call if they are interested.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I used to work with the company, and the only game I ever paid money for was The Last of Us. They never followed up with, kept sending me emails back (they were actually pretty polite). I remember my company was a scam because it was a service they used to offer free games without any royalties, and I didn't even pay them to renew their services. I was just lucky to get games, and I have no reason to complain if they never follow up.

Grapezard: I don't get it. I usually get the "this is amazing" one, but every so often there's a "this is how I played when this was already finished" one.
It just seems so obvious and I don't even know what it is.

Phantom Thief: I don’t think they check on you when they fix patches, I think they are the ones fixing the bugs

~!~The Last of Us 2 Multiplayer - Is it Really Good?

Shao Kahn: So, I can't recall a multiplayer game being this fun and good these days. Is it a good game with good progression? Is it just getting into the action and playing with everyone?
I can't recall a multiplayer game where everything feels good. The building stuff and the shooting are just great.
Any suggestions? Or if I'm not playing multiplayer, anything else?
-----
phant0m: Uncharted 4, Lost Legacy, and Uncharted 2 are all pretty fun multiplayer titles.
Uncharted 2 is definitely the best though.
-----
Blackquill: The new god of war, it's a multiplayer game, but its really good
-----
Rychu: Uncharted 4 campaign is so good.
-----
Shao Kahn: Uncharted 4 campaign is the best I've played in my life. It plays great in spurts, but it's the only single-player RPG I've ever played (I think Uncharted 4 was the first one I played).
-----
Ratchetdude231: I played tons of Uncharted 2 multiplayer and it was pretty damn fun. The first time playing UC2 it felt like I was playing a Nintendo 64 game. I really appreciated how the communities of the games were so friendly.
-----
LonestarZues: I think the best multiplayer game is The Last of Us.
-----
Shao Kahn: Oh yeah, I forgot about Uncharted 2 multiplayer. Thanks for the reminder.
-----
Ahasverus: It's a fun game but Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy never managed to capture my interest.
-----
sappyday: Uncharted 4 is the best in the franchise imo.

====================
~!~Final Fantasy 6 has the best song in the series

theofficefan99: I'm not even a huge JRPG fan (don't even have an xiii pc), but I really like Final Fantasy 6.
I actually purchased the game for the first time in like 6 years. I thought this was going to be the first Final Fantasy for the PS4.
I played a lot of JRPG last gen so I was actually far from being able to get really good at JRPGs.
But one thing about Final Fantasy 6 that I really love was the soundtrack.
All the FF games have great OST aside of FF IV and it's OST.
FF6 OST is fucking fantastic. I haven't heard a single track of this game since I was young.
I'm trying to think of a single song that isn't from an actual FF game (don't even have Chrono Trigger installed on to my non-existent head).
What do you think?
-----
Twonny: I like it way more than most songs in the series.
The music in this game is just a piece of cake.
-----
sir_crocodile: I was alright with it but I remember hating the battle system. It's just a lot of bong-blew-zippy
-----
Bishop89: best ost in the mm
-----
Blade24070: It’s the best FF even though the music is also garbage.
-----
Aquavelvaman: I still miss the battle system and world
-----
jwk94: All the music in the game is lame.
-----
Ratchetdude231: They should have been the main composer for the game. 
And the music sucks.
-----
Saint-14: It’s the best FF anyways.
-----
Viale: I love the battle system, and the new ost is great as well, but the battle system is really god-tier.

~!~Is it just me, or is there a correlation between game development and longevity?

Thewonandonly: So, I work.. I have a long career in game design, I work.. I play.. I watch.. I play.. There I have a long career in game design that I know.... and I am well aware of.... I know.. I have a long career in game design, I am well aware of.. I know.. I play.. I play..
-----
Crayon: I am not sure. Like, I am well aware that we're not all going through that phase of our lives. But I still think about it.
But I'm not entirely clear. I will pick up a game and I'll have a whole week of lunch or a half with a couple of friends or some short movie. I'll be at my best gaming capability and I'm pretty sure it'll be one of the best years of my life.
-----
Radishhead: I don't really think it's any coincidence. I'm pretty sure there are quite a few of us on this planet, all of us together.
-----
Thewonandonly: I think we’re all a part of the same fabric. I’m not sure how to explain it. I’m sort of alone.

~!~How is the Switch online service?

Pablo Mesa: I have heard a lot of this before, but i was super surprised to find that nothing is currently available for it, and since there is no current dedicated servers the price is yet to be acceptable
So, i paid 200$ for a sub for a month on Amazon, and im at a loss. 
The service i have is not good, but i understand that there is some 1 time free games for that month, and a few select ones that time wise shouldnt take a hit for me, but not for paying for online, which is why i decided to buy it, and to not pay for the sub, which costs me more per hour played
So, now im looking at a situation, and looking for some advice, how is the service?
-----
Dekuman: It's pretty good. I'd wait for a sale if I'm paying a sub.
-----
Phantom Thief: It’s pretty good. It’s not a terrible service, and it’s not like Nintendo is doing anything to encourage people to use the service.
-----
ImperatorPat: It’s pretty good. At least they are fixing some issues, the games are great.
-----
Atheerios: It's ok, but not really worth it in my opinion.
-----
Phantom Thief: There is a free trial if you want to try the service. It’s not nearly as good as the other options, and the only way to get a free trial is to pay online.
-----
Nanashrew: There's a free trial if you want to try it.
-----
Phantom Thief: There is a free trial to try it.
-----
Phantom Thief: Kinda? There's a free trial to try it.
-----
Minishdriveby: If the game are good, I'll give it a go. Otherwise, I wouldn't pay more than $20.

~!~Wizards of Legend II announced, announced! (PC, Consoles, Steam)

Stygr: Wizard of Legend II was announced in a stream on Steam. It was announced in a few days ago.
-----
hob982: I’m in.
-----
Hero of Legend: It's a shame Wizards of Legend was dead :(. That game was fun, but I wish they'd make a third game even if they did make a good game...
-----
LordGorchnik: I seriously cannot wait to play this again as it looks like an even better game from the same team. Hopefully they can get us a sequel somewhere.
-----
Horseticuffs: This is such a wonderful game. I'm looking forward to finally finishing it.
-----
Stygr: Yes, they did :(
-----
SuikerBrood: I wonder if they could do a sequel with the assets from the first game, or a spiritual successor.
-----
LycanXIII: I'd like to hear more about it.

====================
~!~"The last time we visited the universe"

Phendrift: I don’t think I can relate this well to anything related to the past.
What I do think is relate is the original reveal of the story. The way it was, with so many hints and mysteries left to discover. 
It was only later in the game where we were presented with some of these hints that we were fully invested.
First you have, the mechanical reasoning that the toys, and the universe itself was collapsing.
Now, the game opens up, and this is where the show really came to light.
You see, in the very beginning of the game, you are presented with a painting, the world is evolving, a story is being told, and you are meant to visit the future by going back in time to check the events of the past.
What you notice at the end of the game is this massive tapestry of foreboding and mystery. It’s like you were in the past, but you have no idea what happens at the end. 
The conclusion is that at some point in the future you are in the past, but you are not. The Architect then goes on to say these words:
And the final mystery is answered, with a mysterious tablet which you have to pass and which you have to read (in a game which gives you so many hints inside your head, you are even able to see the "what it means" within your imagination!"
So Era, what was your favorite moment of the entire trilogy?
-----

TheMink: I thought it was a great reveal.
-----
Silky: Neat, did we learn that the T-Rex is sentient and that the Triforce is a portal to the past?
-----

Phendrift: I’m sure I read this thread in the car while laying in bed.
-----
Yasai: It was everything. FINALLY.
The whole ending felt like a last play through of the first three games.
-----

Raijinto: It was definitely a great end to the trilogy, and quite frankly, a last play through of the trilogy.
-----
Cantona222: I didn't really care what they were doing with that ending. The game was great though and it's a shame we never saw it in a remaster. :(
-----

====================
~!~LTTP: Red Dead Redemption, aka how I got spoiled?

Imerty: I've never watched or played any of the games on the PS4, but for some reason I always read Red Dead Redemption and how I got completely lost when Arthur was driving all the time on some quests. It's a game I'll never forget - and for good reason.
I'm only a few hours in, about two hours in and I'm not enjoying the story at all. I'm just driving around looking for things to do and nothing of consequence happens. I don't understand what's happening, how the game got me this far. I have no idea how I avoided it the first time.
I've had other people give me the same problems, but I think it's because they think they know what to do, and they don't.
Some people get triggered. They might have it, but they don't. The game hits them hard, and then they are like "ok, I'm going to drive a hundred cars" and just never do anymore, never coming back. I had this one time where I had a really easy time with a game that was tough to pull me mind toward doing it. It was driving around in circles, trying to get to Mexico or Canada etc.
I don't know what to do, what to do, and I just don't like it. I was playing the 360 version on the X and it became almost a survival mode in survival mode at that point. I can't even enjoy a survival game anymore.
It's not that I don't like survival games, but for me it was just bla bla. Just drive by bla bla bla.
And I guess this is why I avoided the game when it came to Red Dead Redemption. I'm a huge fan of western RPGs, but for some reason I am not a fan of Red Dead Redemption.
I've had a bit of a bad experience with the game since the first mission.
I'm gonna try and post a different YouTube video later today showing a different experience I got from the game. I guess the first few missions are easy, but that's not to say that the game is meant to be played in a very specific way.
-----
inner-G: I mean, the mission "to steal the technology" is pretty bloody straightforward.
-----
Starlatine: It does feel like you need

~!~Sell me on Larian Studios, Larian Studios Go, and why I love them so much

Dreamboum: I'm sure most of you would be absolutely shocked to know that I love Larian Studios. I love them with the love and care that I have for them. The technical side of them is outstanding. They are in the Gaming Pixel Art category. I look forward to any art school student, artist, or even professional artist that I meet through interactions. The studio I play most of is filled with great people that I know have a special attachment to. They have a very unique art school that I don't think is replicated enough. I think it's because of this unique art school that I can only really think of one of when I look at the website.
I'm mainly interested in what they are working on. The website has a card for people to present to the studio which is in no way comparable to the card I've used for many years. The website has a calendar of games I have seen recommended that I am interested in, and I'm aware that it has a lot of information that I don't know. I don't know if the website has a lot of information but I think they have a lot of interesting projects which they probably want to check off before they focus on a specific game. It's something I've been interested in since the video games boom which was a very positive environment for them. I think the video game and animation industries are so small that you can't really produce as many things as a logo alone.
I'm mainly interested in a game that they have written and are working on. I'm not so much interested in a game I have seen recommended that I am more familiar with but I do have a few things that I was not expecting to find out about. I wish I was in the world of art books and they had some actual recommendations about games in that style, I'm not sure if they would be able to read them but the ones I found were good. I'm not quite sure what to expect from the Larian team but I have a lot to ask. I'm not even sure what I should say.
-----
Yasai: I loved them when they were still known for the Final Fantasy X-8 secret movie.
-----
poussi: I like them because they tend to focus on puzzles and platforming that are not really possible in other pieces of art.

~!~I have a friend that has purchased my Switch through gift certificates and even on occasion has gifted it to me. He opened a box of 50 games and I opened a box of 50 games. Now I have no clue what he is thinking when he opened the box. Help please
-----
SolVanderlyn: I know people have done this to others, but I think the double-edged swords of cussing and honking makes you less likely to get a refund.
If it's your first console, do it. If you use it, do it. Don't buy it.
-----
Porygon: I have a friend who opened a box of 90 games and gave me a box of Gold Coins , and I said HOLY CRAP, what a terrible display of information about the games, they are only 6 days old and they will be replaced by whatever crap the box had which is not worth it
-----
Cronogear: I've done this to a few friends on occasion as well.
-----
Tambini: I have a friend who gave me a box of 500 indies, 1 to 2 days old. The box was in perfect condition, the disc was glazed and there was no bubbles or marks on the box
-----
Weiss: Just do it. It's a great gesture.
-----
melodiousmowl: I have a friend who opened a box of VHS tapes and gave me a box of DVDs at no charge.
-----
Phil32: Yeah, there's no harm in opening things up, though I definitely do this to my friend who is opening boxes of DVD's and stuff that's not on shelves.
I do this to a friend who wants to buy my Switch.
-----
CormoranStrike: This.

~!~The secret ingredient in Animal Crossing is the colors of the leaves

Birdie: So, like a few other things in the recently released Animal Crossing, you can choose the colors of the leaves to put on your furniture, on your ceiling, or just in your room.
I'll go first, the one that I love the most.
It's very cute, and very relaxing. I don't think it's even that colorful, but it actually looks a little deppy.
The other is a little more sweet, but I like it a lot more.
I really like the yellow/pearl/blue color combination. Just the right amount of gooey. And the leaves also look a lot more vibrant.
The other is probably the more fantastical one, which I also love. Instead of just a simple white/red/blue candy colour, you can have your furniture or the fire or grass, or the distant sun, or even a little bit of fish, or whatever else you can come up with. It's got a lot of colour, and great use of energy, and very light, so it would ideally be a nice 'mono green'.
The other one I really like is the green one, but I can't quite put my finger on why. It's probably just nostalgia, but it makes it so that you can pick your favorites, but not your favourites.
-----
Kamiyouni: I like the yellow and purple color of the leaves.
-----
MaitreWakou: Damn, that's awesome.
I love the colorful leaves, it gives me the green feeling.
-----
MaitreWakou: I love the yellow too. I'm a sucker for that kind of atmosphere.
-----
Jahranimo: I love the blue one.
-----
LewieP: I like the yellow the most.
-----

Carassius Auratus: I really like the yellow, orange, and green color combination.
-----
HockeyGuy412: Yeah I'm gonna have to pick up purple, its pinky and short colorful color combination really makes it pop. I love the pop in the grass, it's like the light petals that really makes the colors pop.
-----
Xavi: I like the blue one.

~!~What kind of FPS overkill is your favorite?

CannonFodder52: So I've been playing a lot of Overwatch lately, and my friends have been having a lot of fun with the game. When the game first came out, a lot of the complaints were made about how many players there are in the building. Turns out, there is an imbalance in that game. Most people end up camping in the opposite direction from themselves to get a safe foothold and maybe a fighting chance behind it. So, in comp careers, you end up camping with your team, and that's pretty much Overwatch, where your comps end up being the ones who get killed the most.
In the old days, we'd all play the same game competitively, doing the same thing. We'd all get into comps, do the same thing, and just end up getting killed over and over. We were all trying to compete to last and win, but eventually we'd all end up winning, and it all just ended up happening over and over again.
So, my question is, what kind of overkill do you like?
I'd like to hear what kind of overkill you enjoy.
-----
LightKiosk: I feel like I am in a minority of people who prefer playing overwatch over competitively. There is no rush.
-----
c0Zm1c: I prefer competitve mp, it's more fun to me.
-----
Masterspeed: I don't really understand what Overwatch is.
-----
Mondy: I like Horde, but if I had to choose it'd be overwatch imo.
-----
DrArchon: I like to play assault, but I don't like overwatch's pace so much.
-----
FrostyLemon: I have a hard time picking a game over action oriented MP game. Overwatch doesn't have that and I have way more fun with the game picking over the top tactics of the other team lol.
-----
Vulcano's Assistant: I prefer the new crazy stuff, overwatch and the map design in overwatch.
-----
kittens: in a nutshell, you're the new face of the genre, you have no backseat
-----
CannonFodder52: As someone who started playing overwatch MP once, I'm having fun.

~!~Is it me or is the way RDR 2 is looking to play for those new to open world games?

EkStatiC: I mean there are some games with open world level of scale that are on all the consoles right now. RDR2 looks stunning compared to other open world games.
But RDR2 is looking to be a lot more "proper" scaled than previous open world games. I mean there is a difference in the way RDR 2 looks, but the scale is much more "proper" in comparison to other open world games out right now.
I am not a big RDR 2 fan, its simply reminded me of my first playthru for example Assassin's Creed Origins.
I am also very interested in RDR 2, but am not sure if its the "right" way to play it, to be honest.
-----
Imran: I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that RDR 2 will be fantastic. But it's going to be a lot more of a leap of faith with the setting and whatnot. 
I'm more of a fan of Rockstar than I am a open world dev.
-----
Mojito: Yes it is. It looks extremely clean and has a good sense of scale. I am looking forward to the post-launch support.
-----
Rizific: I mean, if you follow the open world games on console, even the ones you choose to play on PC, you are getting a much deeper, more detailed and immersive experience as time goes on, as RDR2 shows. But in comparison to RDR2, Rockstar nailed that.
-----
Falchion: I'll be double dipping I think.
-----
Chumunga64: I can't wait!
-----
AudioEppa: Same here.
-----
DionardoLicaprio: It's a great game, but I am not sure about it being "open world" (on consoles at least) or not.
I still think R* will have a bigger world, and the controls will be a lot more responsive.
-----
Van Bur3n: The primary method of traversing Redding is a bastard. RDR2 will never, ever be open world. 
That bastard is the game that keeps udding your nose into frustration.

~!~Should I buy a PC or wait for the inevitable PS5?

Randroid: Hi everybody! I'm in the market for a new PC system, and I have a feeling this year will see the release of several highly anticipated mid-gen "vanilla" ports of their mid-gen titles. I know that the first port is likely PS4. I would like to wait a bit before I buy one because the other two may have a release date, but I'm wondering if I should hold off until then to see what the pricing for them is.
I know the PS5 is coming out in about three months. I'm not sure if that's a good look, but I really want to wait for that too.
-----
Aokiji: You’re in for a treat
-----
Lackless: I mean, you're not gonna charge 60$ for a system. It's not going to come out within six months.
-----
Jonno394: I think you're in for a treat if you wait a bit. The PS5 is coming out in 12 months so I'm sure you'll be happy with that.
-----
Nyx: PS5 is probably around the corner if you wait for it. I personally don’t think it’s worth your time if you aren’t already used to the PS4’s and Xbone’s of late.
-----
Flandy: I think you should wait for the PS5. They’re not releasing in like literally every week, it’s just not there when you need it
-----
nogoodnamesleft: You don’t need a PS5 to be in. Just buy a PS4 and play the majority of your games on it.
-----
N.Domixis: You’re in for a treat OP. I’m buying a PC version of Spider-Man so I expect some big down time from me
-----
Flandy: I’m in for the end of the road as well
-----
N.Domixis: Why not? You can play almost all the games you want before the PS5 comes out.

~!~Wargroove is almost finished, help me get started with Wargroove

Rlan: I just bought a Switch. No idea what to expect, but I'm pretty excited. The game is awesome, and has depth.
I've played the first 3 chapters, and I think it's fun. But there are a lot of things I don't like about the game, and it's just a very different experience than what I'd like it to be.
The tutorial is pretty basic, and I'm not quite sure how to move the world, but I know it's a lot of the game world in its current state.
I've been having some issues with the game world, mainly with the shooting. The game wants me to go into a room and just shoot stuff. The shooting doesn't really get much more interesting. It seems like every time I attempt to shoot, I accidentally twist my wrist doing that. I have to start over from the start. I put the controller away, and I can't bring myself to click the stick. I'd like to continue, or at least attempt to progress.
I'm just not sure if I want to be a Wargroove player or a Wargroove-only person. Is there a way to actually win? How do I advance through the story?
And what other input options are available?

Liam Allen-Miller: There’s one in the main story — its pretty basic, but if you don’t like that part of the game, play the game. 
It’s also a good way to get your gear back for the later chapter, as they’re usually required before the game.
-----
Cybersai: Level up and level evolve. Go back and forth until you find the right magic to take you along. Do some side quests and dungeons (if you find one that interests you), and then do some other quests.
-----
Rallis: It's not a very simple game, it has to have a good story to really work.
-----
TheBaldwin: You can develop your character by leveling up. Its not like botw where you cant go back to the starting zone or start with your best weapon.
You can craft items you want

~!~What do you want from Fire Emblem 7?

Crazy Izanagi: So Fire Emblem 7 is getting a new trailer where we can see what other Fire Emblem fans are excited for and a new trailer where we can finally see what other fans are hoping for from the game.
Personally, I want a story set in Harmonia and Kassandra in a new story that takes place in Harmonia after Awakening. I also want Kassandra to return, taking her from the Fire Emblem world and traveling through time in order to reach places like Harmonia proper and meet the other characters.
Kinda like Echoes, though I’m not sure if they’ll use the same style of story.
I have a few hopes:
Harmonia has some interesting lore in it. I think it’s possible to have a new Harmonia story as the first book that explains some of the lore of that world and Kassandra’s backstory.
I think it would be a really good way to a bit the casual fan.
Also any other ideas?
-----
Kokonoe: Nothing new.
-----

Crazy Izanagi: A story set in Harmonia.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I’m hoping we get a new world in the spinoff series.
-----
Innuendo84: I want a new OPs. Link from BotW, Terra from Fates.
-----
Cirrus: I want Kassandra back to do a story about two of the greatest warriors in the world, Harmonia and FE7.
Maybe a new story about the war of liberation between the two, only to see them go on a bloody rampage and use their axe as a weapon as a reminder of their past.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I’d like to.
I’d like a new game set in Harmonia.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I like you’d like the story set after Awakening.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I think you’d like that.
I also want Kassandra to be back as they’re badass human beings and not monsters.

~!~Have you ever reinstalled a game and forgot you've had a copy stored away?

Mondy: I have, and I've gotten a copy of NBA Street Vol. 2 and have been wondering if I should try and finally start this up. 
I have a crazy, seedy Sega Saturn hidden away and the game I was playing on it didn't work. Had to redownload the entire game on top of it and beat it again, so I'm thinking I might just need to go get my copy of the Dreamcast and try again. 
Anyone else have this and/or a similar game and run into this happening once?

WonderLuigi: I have a copy of Ocarina of Time that I reinstalled.

~!~Black Ops 4: which other CoD game is worth it and which other games are not?

Much: I'm currently playing Black Ops 4 and it's really great. I'm not a big fan of CoD games, they do a disservice to the campaign and the overall experience.
I've always wanted to play a CoD game, but I've never played a WWII/IIII multiplayer game. I was thinking of getting BF1 but not sure if it's worth it, I feel like the campaign was a big let down and the multiplayer was a bit more fun than the campaign.
Are there any other CoD games that I should get? Is there a CoD game I'm missing?
Also, what's the best CoD campaign to play?
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I mean you’re not missing anything. Honestly CoD is the best CoD. It’s fun and it’s great for the money.
-----
Lugnutal: Are you not into CoD? It seems like a really good pick for multiplayer.
-----
Falconbox: CoD is the best.
-----
Retro: I know, but I'm not a big WWII/II guy.
-----
ATOMICJORGE: BF is the best but WW2 is great
-----
TheRedSnifit: CoD is the most fun. But Black Ops is the most fun.
-----
10k: Never played WWII CoD.
-----
Mullet2000: The best, it's really fun, pretty much garbage and the multiplayer is the best.
-----
Stygr: CoD is the best, and BF1 is the best.

~!~What's your all-time favorite Pokémon?

Francesco: I’m currently playing Let’s Go Eevee. The Switch version is on the market and I’m excited to play it again.
I like the concept of the different types of Pokémon (although I prefer the type 0).
I love the (excellent) typing.
I love the personality.
And I’m a fan of the (excellent) Pokémon designs.
What do you all have favorite Pokémon?
-----
Kodaman: Snap!
-----
CormoranStrike: I don't know about Pokémon, but in the original I started to dislike it and I really wanted the finale to be so sad and disappointing that I had to make a thread.
-----
Professor Beef: I love Pikachu and the designs, and its the only one I haven't beat.
-----
Pikachu: Pokedex has a bunch of really great ones
-----

jacktuar: Not counting Pichu and I’m really sad that we never got a pikachu in Yellow.
Hoping for another great thread to shed some light on some of my favourite designs.
-----
Haley J.: I like Pikachu, Pikachu, Eevee, and Eevee
-----

Nairume: I never really got into the original series due to the monotomy-style catching mechanic, but I'm hoping that I discover something new with Let's Go, especially after a hiatus.

Silky: This embarrasses me

DNAbro: Just announce the streaming versions of the PS4

~!~Best use of leucarine colour in gaming?

TheGhost: I just got a used copy of Smash Bros Ultimate from GameStop, the only game I have left of the new game. I know I'd get a lot of shit for it, but I just wanted to buy it as I don't like playing with the colors of the rainbow. How do I do this? 
I have a plastic trumpet (the colors of the rainbow) holder sitting in my GameStop's back room labeled "Leucarine Paste" but I can use anything. What do I need to know to get a new copy.
-----
Cybersai: I use Hennessy for mine when I go to my local Gamestop to get a new copy.
I use GloBob for my GameStop to do my laundry.
-----
Syril: I use Grog and the rest of the stuff I don't have.
-----
TheGhost: I guess I'd say so, I tried GloBob but those are tacky as hell.
-----
TheGhost: Ahh thanks, also I wanted to know if I should check out the stores elsewhere or just go to the store I never shop at to get the same thing. I go to the stores all the time but I don't shop at gamestop.
-----
Panther2103: I use one store to buy video games and another to play them. Mostly the used store because they have multiple video games with certain bonuses.
-----
TheGhost: I was thinking about this yesterday.
Does anyone know if the leucarine is white on the inside? I feel like I've seen it before, I think I saw a poster a few years ago that says otherwise, I think it's white inside out. 
I guess I'm just wondering if I should get this or not, I have gotten white shoes from a store and I've never worn them in the past.
-----
TheGhost: Ahh thanks, I'll do it.
-----
TheGhost: Thanks! Glad I did, always appreciate all the feedback.

~!~What are some good "small" games for a console?

Gartooth: I have a PS4. My dad wants to take it as his first console when he dies. I've been a PS4 player for my entire life and always wanted to play a big RPG. I've also currently been playing through the Last Guardian and have had a PSVR on standby (though I'm not sure if I should have just and haven't and want a second one). That and I've looked at a bunch of games, mostly about big RPGs.
I'm not going to lie, I'm blown away by the quality of an RPG in this day and age. The last one I played was Final Fantasy 6. I'm not going to lie, I think the first one might have been pretty mediocre, too. I just love the atmosphere of the world and the characters, the writing is very good, the voice acting is pretty good, and the world itself is intriguing. It's not something I can say for every single game, but it's one of my favorites.
So, I'm just curious what you guys have enjoyed or what kind of games you've had the most fun with your consoles. What sort of games do you usually enjoy, which is it require you to be involved to play them?
-----
Aters: Fire Emblem Awakening. I've only had fun with 3 Houses and Freedom Planet.
-----
FloatOn: I'm not a console person but I definitely play League of Legends and Rocket League almost daily.
-----
Gibordep: The Witcher 2, it was a big change for me. I think I started playing this game in middle school and having a blast. Played it a lot, but always wanted something with a good story.
-----
Aters: I think you may have also found the best co-op games in the genre
-----
Bulby: Ape Escape
-----
SpinlyLimbs: I play RPGs and shooters, but the ones that I really enjoy are the ones that I've played. I've been a PC gamer my entire life.
-----
Gibordep: I've loved a lot of games in the genre.
-----
Fantastapotamus: Doom.
But I've never been one for the "console warz" 
But I love to read and play games on my Vita

It's a shame, it was a pretty good game.

Deleted member 11018: Is there a mobile version of this game? I have no idea what the gameplay is like, I don't know if I'll play it for nostalgia, but I'd love a remake on mobile of this style

Lonely1: I don't think it's necessary to support all the features, so I don't think it's a big deal.

Wulfric: Huh? They're still using the DX12 engine?
-----
cw_sasuke: They have dropped the ball with their marketing so hard..
-----
Deleted member 15538: Ugh. Would have been better to not have invested in anything Unity, they take their marketing farts way too seriously.
-----
Jesse Gomez (IGN): What's the problem?
-----
low-G: I've been trying to get an impression of what to expect with this stuff, and it's all so bad.
It's not like it costs money to make all their 3D-project stuff (or money), and they're still just testing their own games and refining them... 
If Unity dropped the ball so hard with their marketing and PR, this is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen.
-----
AnubisRising: so they will stop supporting .vs. the pro model ?
-----
sibarraz: I really hope that this will mean that the next console will have native support for DX11 games, because even in the past where DX12 was supported, they had no reason to support the new AMD architecture

~!~LTTP: Just Cause 3 - aka what a great game this is

TheFallenSaboteur: After watching a couple of streams and just getting myself a copy of 3, I decided to give this game a go. I've put in way, many hours into this game and I've basically burnt myself out on open world game mechanics/design principles. The game's open world design is sublime and the game kicks your ass like a champ (I think the first time I played it I spent two hours on one). The gameplay is sublime. The open world feels alive and the physics engine are sublime. The on-foot/carriages are sublime. There are so many things to do that you end up progressing at a leisurely pace instead of jogging from mission to mission. The only problem is that you can't do these as fast as you'd like.
The controls are so responsive. When you hold down the A/B button, you get a big circle shaped bump that when you press normally you will not control. This is extremely annoying since the A/B buttons are in the middle of the controller's reach. Holding down B makes everything even harder and I have trouble pressing them at all times. This is the first game I've had to force a button select during gameplay because I can't feel the A/B button (or B button) while I'm in control of the JC car. I had to go out of the way to make sure the controls felt good while I was in JC2 and not have to press B during gameplay. I suppose I'm just bad at JC3 but damn, this is the most frustrating and frustrating experience of my gaming career. So many times I feel like I'm holding the A button and the B button is barely working. I've tried adjusting the X/Y bindings but I can't do it and that's not easily my problem. I'm just frustrated and can't figure out what is the "right" button to press during gameplay.
The controls are fine in JC3, though. I can't feel my right stick and my left analog sticks are not shoulder tracked. I do not remember having difficulty using the right stick in JC2 or 4. I also did not recall any game having difficulty using the left stick in the JC game mode. I just feel that it is a bad design choice.
The only other game I played on the JC system and had the same issue was Super Mario

~!~Capcom Says Nintendo Switch Is the Most Powerful Market in History And The Most Powerful Market in History Of Business, In Gaming

Phantom Thief: Source
Capcom says that the Switch’s increasing energy, volume, and competition will have an impact on the market. "Nintendo Switch is the most powerful market in history of business, globally," says Ms. Suouyama, Market SVP, Consumer Goods and Digital Software at Nintendo. "The Switch is well-established in the Asian Market, and will likely be the best-ever power race between the Global Market and our domestic market."
Nintendo Switch
Nintendo Switch Online
The Switch has created an unprecedented supply of high-quality hardware, software, and hardware-software to support the development and expansion of video games and accessories. Nintendo Switch hardware sales have more than tripled in the past four years, making it the most-renovated supply chain for video games software worldwide. The Switch hardware sales have driven the software sales growth to $2.5 billion in 2018, making it the bestselling software and hardware of 2018 in the U.S., up more than four times from the prior year. In the Americas, Nintendo Switch software sales were approximately double the previous record, and its hardware sales represent a new record for Nintendo.
"At the global Retail Center, we have been able to provide crucial support to Nintendo Switch players in underserved communities. Our network play and network services help us support over 60,000 retail and E-shop segments across the U.S., and we have more than 17.5 million voice-over device sales," says Suouyama. "That’s more than all across the U.S. eShop and more than any console since the Xbox One. We are excited to provide hardware and software packages to retailers in the coming months, and we are sure to introduce more game options and improvements to existing games in the coming months. We are especially excited about our future game packages, which will broaden our selection of original and original game content."

~!~What's your favorite spoof of a video game character?

DrKelpo: I've been thinking, "It's gotta be" when it comes to this kind of thing. Like, it could be Mario in a Spider-Man game or Spider-Man in a new Batman game. But instead, it's just Spider-Man. 
First of all, I'm not counting media characters in video games. I'm not even talking about spoofs where a video game character is a fictional character. 
Anyway, I just wanted to see what the most popular video game related character is.

vestan: Van Halcks

Cess007: I can't decide yet, but Darksiders is definitely one of my favs.

Sgt. Demblant: I was gonna ask how a white dude in GTA 3 was treated in the game.

~!~"Dissapoion" (Jak and Dictator)

Chaos17: So I just saw "Dissapoion" for the first time and got really hyped. I got to the point where I was overwhelmed by so many characters and stories that I just did not care about anything else. I played for an hour or two and nothing about this game made me feel any good.
First of all this game goes to a new level of immersion. You walk through a screen and you press buttons. When you do this you are walking through a story. Your walk across the screen is different from that of the last 3 games. For example you could run across the screen and not even just jump from thing to thing. You are a outsider. You dont have to be a " outsider " in this game. You can be an outsider but not " an outsider " in this game. The characters, the tone, the music, the atmosphere, the pacing. All this is not in a literal sense of the game. Your character is not the only thing in this game. Everything about the game is placed inside a space that is being used as a space to connect things into things. You are not going to be transported somewhere else by the camera. You are going to be lost in a space that is being used as a space to connect things to things.
Even here I was like, this game has some serious issues. I found out about the poll collecting system and I changed my character into a new one of the two characters. I did not care about the story or the characters. I only care about the gameplay. Had some fun fights. The game had some bad shit pacing.
I will see what I can do about the rest of the game. I will probably only spend time doing things that are not optional.

~!~Is there a better/easier way to teach a beginner to play games?

Joshg27: Just curious to see what everyone has been able to get their minds/powersubmit to master in this area. I'm looking for any tips, actual advice would be appreciated. I'm leaning towards using a walkthrough and so far the game has recommended using walkthrough instructions. I'm also open to suggestions if I'm observed using them!
-----
TheMoon: This is more your best option, but if you're going to suggest a walkthrough then don't try to tell the player what to do.
-----
LonestarZues: I would play the game in a structured way and give them a structured play through, usually just a few chapters to get to the end game; this will reduce the repetitiveness and encourage a more methodical approach from the player to get through the game.
-----
TheMoon: Yes, give them a structured playthrough.
-----
TheMoon: They're going to put in a structured play through, not a walkthrough.
-----
Joshg27: I'm not sure why this is even a thing?
-----
TheMoon: that's cool, they are asking if they can be played 'through' and not being more direct.
-----
TheMoon: They're asking if they can be played, not if they can be repeated. They're not asking if they can be completed faster or less frequently. They're asking if they can be done in order or with differing complements.
-----
LonestarZues: The player is more likely to give them a structured playthrough if they enjoy a challenge.
-----
TheMoon: If they enjoy it they can continue playing in whatever order they wish, or with whatever condition they are experiencing.

~!~What is your favorite type of survival horror?

signal: Survival Horror
This genre is famous for a combination of games that have been discussed so often but in what particular? I want to hear what you all consider the best. Survival Horror is the horror atmosphere. Games with the genre's most iconic feature in the form of the player facing a grotesque presence or enemy in the game's present or future form that often employs a similarly grotesque, surreal, or horror-y environment.
My favorite is a survival horror game that employs a similar element of storytelling but it comes with a more tangible objective of making it to the scary part of a room. As a kid, I remember jumping out of my skin when I had this encounter and running to my death in Kamoshida. I was so anxious, so tense, so scared, and so excited, so in the hell. (One of my feels is that this nightmare almost always happens and it's as if we have to wait for it to end and we don't know what or how we'll do in this situation to prevent what we're doing from happening)
I love games that have some similar elements, and I think it's a very interesting genre.
-----
Richter1887: I always loved the fact that you could climb everything.
-----
Hieroph: I always loved seeing the game play in the cutscene view on YouTube.
Edit: I really need to go play some Horror Games.
-----
Razgriz417: Not sure if it counts but I can't play as a bad guy in TLOU2 or I get stuck, I can't siege the prison and I gotta escape by flying into space
-----
Razgriz417: what does this play like?
-----
Richter1887: It would play more as a character action game.
-----
signal: I don't know exactly but I always said to myself "When playing a game I will play it like a video game."
I am playing a bit of Brutal Legend right now.
-----
hydrophilic attack: it's a game about flying into space
-----
Richter1887: It changes the game. In a game about flying into space it does.
-----
signal: I think the game is about the struggle to survive and so I think that qualifies as it as a game that's about the struggle to survive but it's also

~!~I just realized that my Switch is JUST connected to the LAN and that's about it

ChristopherDX: I just bought a router and a modem. I have a switch and macbook in the garage and am about to play some 3d cross play on those.
When I’m connected to the LAN port is the screen in the left hand screen playing macbook games on my laptop connected to the LAN. I have a question though. I’ve been playing pc games on my switch for the last 2 weeks and am getting a bit overwhelmed.
Is it just me or does the right foot controller have a little mouse button and button and cart? I’d love to be able to move the mouse around but I know I can’t.
-----
Medalion: It's a bit of a black eye when you're doing this by going into the LAN settings and changing the wireless settings. Yes you can, but you'll need to do it once and then redownload the game.
-----
Cartridge Games: Why the orange r for the right stick?
“Designed for LAN only though”
OK.
-----
Cinemikel: I'm playing on the LAN so its setup is pretty easy

(I'm not talking about the game that made your experience worse, or even the worst game you've played.)
-----
LonestarZues: Pokemon Go.
I was literally just playing it for 10 minutes before I had to go catch a Pokemon because I was stuck in a cutscene and couldn't continue. It was bad.

FluxWaveZ: "Beaten like a fucking Grape."

lucebuce: This is gonna sound stupid but...
-----
HououinKyouma00: I dunno, but I always thought that Donkey Kong Country: Animal Forest was the worst game I had ever played.
-----
CannonFodder52: I was so pissed at the Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn for this. I was so angry, because I wanted a Sonic game on a handheld.
-----
Waddle Dee: I was trying to beat NieR: Automata for the first time. For the longest time I couldn't even keep up with what was going on. Then I got to a point where I killed a boss enemy in the same area as every other boss. I had to run and grab him before he came attacking me. I was so pissed, because I wanted to be sure that the boss hadn't taken the level up hit and take me down.
But then I played Nier: Automata on the Genesis. Man, it's so hard. I still haven't beat it. I have a lot of time for games now.

~!~When does this get better?

Crazy Izanagi: So a while back I decided to replay Persona 5.
It is a game where your party members are all pretty much teens at the age of 15 and they all have a cool line up.
If you enjoy JRPGs you’ll love Persona 3 and 4 also.
I’d recommend trying Persona 3 as well.
-----
massoluk: I think Persona 3 is the gold standard.
-----
Disco: The latest Yakuza games might've done it for me, though they haven't aged well at all for me. But if you're going to play Persona 3 you should go with Atlus as well.
-----
Funyarinpa: You're going to have a blast, but I think the biggest hurdle is the age ratings, which will really suck in relation to other games.
Same goes for HZD.
-----
RochHoch: Persona 3 is a classic.
-----
Acquiescence: I don't think you can say Persona is the golden age of JRPGs. It was a decline in all regard at the time, and you can't really go back to the era of PS1-era Persona titles.
Spoiler
-----
Aurc: The Persona games are very easy to port to modern platforms, and they're great on their own. I say this as someone who adores the PS1 era, but still likes to go through the baggage and potential burn out.
Losing out on so much older titles is not a great experience and you have to find a way to play them. I say this with a Persona focused on social links and being a party game.
-----
Linkark07: It can be tough but I think Persona 3 is the golden age of JRPGs.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I mean I don’t know about that. I guess if you can’t get what Atlus specialize in then you can just play the older titles.

Anyways, that's pretty fucking awesome.

BillFromAccounting: Yeah, I remember thinking the original design looked good.
-----
Cokesouls: Looks very good.

GayAnimeDad: Yeah, that looked bad.

mrmickfran: It's so weird seeing Dante's eyes go all "HOLY SHIT DID YOU KNOW!?" Like they must know he's got 2 left to kick.
-----
Etrian Darkness: I'm confused.

Dullahan: I remember being really confused when I first saw it. Dante's eyes looked kinda weird.

Egida: Was this from the Devil May Cry series?

~!~Why aren't more people buying digital games?

BAD: You can buy a game on steam, there are no additional costs, all purchased in one console.
It’s just like buying a game in the US on a console...
-----
Svart: Because?
-----
Phantom Thief: Because it's advertising.
-----
Euler: Because it's a marketing tool.
-----
maximumzero: Because it’s not really in-game purchases, it’s the disc space that’s being spent, and the servers that are used for selling the game.
-----
Jayson's Rage: Because people buy shit that they want.

~!~The Verge: Why I'm Hoping For PS5 Mobile Support

SinCItyAssassin: I’m really curious about this and the other thread about the other thread about the lack of PS5 Mobile.
What I’d like to know about the situation and the reasons it’s happening:
1) Why do you think Sony and Microsoft are ditching mobile for the next-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles?
2) What do you like from the situation? I’m curious myself about the situation, and if you’d like to see the results of this move and if there’s anything you’d like to see?
-----
DanteLinkX: Research Analyst from Ovnichroa
Mobile is the reason behind the change and the future are bright for everyone involved...
-----
Aokiji: Sony is the leader when it comes to phones and they’ll do the same when they replace them. Japan is the exception here.
-----
Puffy: We have had many threads on this topic and I feel like even one of them is a failure
-----
Nagito: Tech Analyst from the same group that said we don't need mobile solution.
-----
CaviarMeths: I'm not sure if the article or the research was written in a rush. I remember that one from a few weeks ago and it's been ignoring the fact that the iPhone is to mobile market for Sony.
Also, I'm not sure if the article is actually being facetious or not. There's a couple things going on in the article that I think are very irrelevant, but which I think it touches on pretty much everywhere in the forum that is discussion.
-----
Puroresu_kid: Sony is going to die on this one.
I'm convinced they don't need to take this route with mobile anymore. They need to keep supporting consoles and phones and know what they are doing.
-----
CaviarMeths: I think it's irrelevant. They could have avoided this by only releasing PS5s and the longer they have supported the consoles, and not going to bankrupt PSPs with the launch of the PS3.
-----
Kolx: What's the argument that Sony may not be able to keep up with the mobile market when all we've got is PS4 and it's already well on its way

~!~[Update]: PSN refund issue

Araujo: Hello all,
I have been interested in getting a new copy of The Crew 2 since I bought it a while back. 
Now, I am on a Call of Duty: Black Ops account. 
I came across this post on Reddit ( 
I had no idea that the game was still coming ( (COMMENTING THIRD) )
Now, I received a (COMMENTING THIRD) email that the game is "ready to ship" (COMMENTING THIRD) just based on how quick the update went. 
I ordered the game and the game is ready to ship. 
I have no issues with the refund process. 
Have any other users who got a refund? 
Sorry for my quick response. 
Thanks for answering everyone's questions :)
-----
GrizzNKev: I've got the same issue. It appears to be with my PSN id just not filled with users.
-----
Lashley: How do you even do it? Is it just for 72 hours?
-----
Masterspeed: I'm with you, I've had no issues.
-----
HockeyGuy412: As long as id check my e-mail regularly then no
-----
Lashley: It's up till now then lol.
-----
Araujo: I've had no issues with it, just figured it'd be better to not go through the whole process again.
-----
WillySJ3: I've never had that and the only thing I can confirm with you is that it's free to play.
-----
Lashley: No problem, just wanted to check if it was as it only goes on 72 hours.
-----
Crono: I just did that, and when it hits 72 hours the service signs for it go on sale.

~!~PSA: PS Now Game Streaming is getting pretty wild, but they're killing it

vivftp: As a god willing member of the Resetera gaming community something like this is easy to imagine: Sony is rapidly eating Netflix, Youtube, Amazon, Hulu, etc. out the kitchen sink. They're killing it with their services and they're killing it also with their games. I'm not even talking about streaming any new games in any region where I live, for example. I'm talking the Netflix model where you can get the most news anywhere, including in the mail as well. I could easily live in another world where my PS Store and Store on the Google box came from the cloud.
These days PS Now streaming services are getting crazy as will the number of users. I'm not even talking about the sheer size of the user base or the amount of users filling out surveys like they used to do. I'm just talking about these new services that are trying to cater to a rapidly growing market and I feel like, these companies are going to pay all this money and attention to their users first and foremost.
For years now they've tried everything. Owns every platform, tried improving the store, tried improving the store by removing ads, tried improving the store by adding more third party features. Yet even after all these "lacks" they still can brute force the market. They're not just fighting Netflix, they're fighting Google as well. They're fighting Playstation as well.
I'm not even talking about their attempt at Sony's platform, I'm talking about their attempt to pay all this money and chew up the market by having every platform and store have PS Now.
It's crystal clear why: they're competing with Steam and PlayStation at a competitive disadvantage that shouldn't be getting any better.
If the market is there but not nearly as big as it used to be, they're basically beating them. It's clear why.
I'm not arguing about the percentage of users here. I'm talking about the percentage of users choosing to subscribe to a certain PlayStation store. They're beating Steam by a factor of at least 2.
PS Now is a game that doesn't get talked about. It's a game that gets talked about. It's a game that's talked about, for example, Facebook are killing it.
I think it's clear why: they're competing with Steam.

~!~I want to play another console. What should I get?

LossAversion: I want to play again. I love my PS4 and I bought an SSD last month. I have a 4tb PS3 so I can play games I want. I don't have to do anything with it. I just want to play the games I want. I look at what I can do to get rid of clutter and poor performance. 
I basically don't care if it's in another 2th or 3rd set. Even though the console is capable of 4k and HDR I just want to play the games I want. I look at my library and decide if I should just buy another PS4 and just play exclusives. 
Again I look at my library and decide if I should just buy another PS4 and just play the games I want. I look at what I can do to get rid of clutter and poor performance. 
And finally, what do you think? Is there any other way to get rid of clutter, besides buying more storage?
-----
Mazzle: Sell PSN accounts and play your games there
-----
captainskylion: 
-----
Kenzodielocke: I mean, it‘s not that hard.
-----
LossAversion: I'd say that probably. The PS4 is 100% also an SSD so I'm not too concerned with that.
-----
LossAversion: I mean, it's not that hard. For me it's just that I can't afford another Pro or Slim. I can just buy a Pro. I don't care about the performance or price of any console.
Well, I guess it's not that hard to just buy one more PS4. I guess it's kinda hard to convince me to buy another PS4 when it just won't be able to do 4K and HDR properly.
-----
TitanicFall: Sell your PSN account and play on PS4.
-----
Maneil99: Sell your PSN account and play on PS4.
-----
CaviarMeths: I'd say that at this stage I don't even think there's a way to account share online gaming.
-----

~!~Batman Arkham Knight is now backwards compatible on the Xbox One

G_Shumi: Just got the email.
I've been wanting to play this game for a while and I didn't realize it was already backwards compatible. It's finally backwards compatible!
I've been meaning to play it. I've been waiting for the Arkham Knight OVA to happen but it's probably not coming for the foreseeable future.
-----
G_Shumi: In the case of Knight, you can still play it on PC. However, if you have the PC and have the jailbroken 360, you'll need to download Knight to play it.
-----
Lopez: Cool
-----
Fury451: Wait, how did it go on 360?
-----
G_Shumi: Iirc Knight came to 360 a few years ago and we've been waiting for it since then.
-----
Lopez: I hope they need to add some BC compatibility to the X
-----
Zvonimir Boban: I've been waiting for this for a long time!
-----
Regret: This is the game that got me into gaming again. I remember being absolutely obsessed with Knight and had a blast with it back in the day. I probably should replay it as soon as I have the free time.
-----
Factory 1.21: I remember reading that the game was coming to PC a few years ago.
-----
G_Shumi: I don't have the original Xbox version, but I did get to play it on the 360. It's the only one I own.
I love the game, but I'm surprised that the 360 version is still so expensive to get these days.

~!~Xbox One X X $279.99

Adam802: Just noticed this just randomly showed up on my Facebook ad. 
I know it's $249 but still, a hell of a deal. 
I went from $199 to $299. 
I picked up the $199 T-shirt that came in the box, just received my 3 day xbox one X back in august. 
Will add a link when I see if any threads pop up.
-----
Mitsurugi: That’s great, it’s only $299
-----
Theorry: Great price. Might have to do with the x is special edition.
-----
Adam802: Thanks, I just wanted to post this. I just got a T-shirt too and ordered the X - thanks as hell for that sweet deal.
-----
Mitsurugi: Thanks as! Ill do it for you too
-----
Adam802: Def checking, still got my order in just a couple of days.
-----
Stitch AU: Nice, I don't think I'll go that route but I am thinking about buying the X.
-----
IbizaPocholo: 
-----
Adam802: Yeah, I got the email notification about the special edition and am in maintenance. 
I was just about to get the special edition for $50 for $80, the 6 month is the lowest but I'm thinking if I'm lucky, it'll go lower the next time I buy it.
-----
Mitsurugi: Thanks! Ill take what chance it gives me

====================
~!~Any of you guys got any recommendations for "good" single player games?

Shugga: I played a lot of DayZ and PUBG at the time but I remember it being a lot of fun. I remember the community was crazy and people were really passionate about what they played and it was really good.
But I remember for the most part it was a money grab at its launch.
I had a friend that bought me some tickets for a flight he was going to play, he had to pay me $20 to take my game and he found it for free and I didn't pay anything for the privilege. He also found a flight that was just full of people doing what they wanted and we were having a lot of fun playing together.
I think I remember him saying he was going to play with me tomorrow and see how many people were there and was really excited.
So I remember finding a seat in a big empty lobby and all I can think about is how amazing it was to finally play with someone that wanted to play with me lol.
I never played the multiplayer games or the multiplayer maps much at the time so I didn't know what to play and what maps to play in the time.
I was pretty bummed at the times when I didn't get to play any multiplayer maps for a long time and just got used to the arena style of the game.
So recently I got so into the idea of getting a game going for free that I went back to and figured I'd give that a shot.
So I had to give it a shot, and I had to admit I didn't really know what the hell Play Anywhere was. I had heard about it but was wondering if it was a good time to jump in with the community or if I should just play whatever I heard.
I know there was a few free maps that I got but was I wrong?
-----
TheRedSnifit: Play PUBG or PES 18
-----
Shugga: I think it was PUBG for me. 
But yeah I remember hearing about the game and thinking how it was really fun to play. 
I think I'll wait for Blackout before even booting it up though.
-----

~!~What is the best way to get into the nazis of the real world?

GoldenKings: As I type the game is still blowing me away. I have never played a race before and I really like Kazooka. I've been itching to try one out. What is the best way to do that?
I have a long hattrick in 4X and I love fighting games. But I'm also a very competitive gamer so I don't really have much to play with that's really happening.
-----
Neural: I've had a few friends that have been playing it, but I don't think they are particularly good at it. I haven't tried it myself, but it seems like a lot of people don't know what it is.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Just go in blind and if you're a good person who plays really, really hard it's best to watch a friend play your game
-----
HockeyGuy412: Get a guide and you'll get a lot out of it
-----
Mitsurugi: None of that is true really. I have played 'nazis' from the perspective of Kazooka Kazuma, though I haven't actually played any of the others. I remember that one friend said it was the best way to try him out lol
-----
Borowski: Kazooka is the most fun of all nazis imo, but I would not say it's the easiest or most accessible
-----
FlyStarJay: the only ones I can think of are the ones with the 3ds dubs, as they are no longer available in japan (the first one was the DS one, and I think the second one was done by different composers)
-----
Borowski: It's the most obscure and the most difficult one, but you go in looking for it.
-----
GoldenKings: Thats all I can give though. I have some advice though, go for it. But I'm going to have more fun when I get my ass in the zone and I can just watch it in amazement.
-----

====================
~!~Is it fan art?

Syril: I've been using fan art that's easy to use on my desktop and it's made my library look great.
I've got PicxN: Star Chronicles, Super Rebirth, and Gravity Rush 2.
Gravity Rush 1 is a great example of fan art, and Super is a great example of fan art. 
But what about stuff like Mega Man 8? I mean the art this guy draws is pretty good, but he's drawing from the actual gameplay to the game, which is pretty different from fan art. 
So yeah, any other examples out there?
-----
kadotsu: Posting in ResetEra threads is not allowed.
-----
Syril: I think that's the rule here.
-----
Kyougar: I have a flickering laptop that I use for drawing. 
But I open it before I play it.
-----
Syril: The one I use for drawing is the one from the old arcade game, Neo Geo FX-12.
-----

====================
~!~How's the new Outrun multiplayer mode?

Cow Mengde: I feel like this game is getting kind of overlooked. As far as the games industry goes, this mode was pretty much taking the detours of the arcade/port and the SP/MP in general. I remember a lot of people going super bananas for this mode back in the day. Is it really that good? I haven't been able to play it recently but I heard it's pretty good. 
I love the music and the SP is great. What do people think?
-----
Kokonoe: It's alright.
-----
Svart: I played it for a few hours back then, amazing.
-----
Krejlooc: It's very fun. And the music is great. That said, I personally find the MP is really poor for a pinball mode.
I just wish the SP was better. Not only is it boring to play, but the SP is the only game I play and beat in one sitting.
-----
Svart: Oh, although I was really into it, and enjoyed it.
I guess I'll play it again.
-----
Neptonic: It's fun, but to be honest I wish it had a Pinball mode
-----
Krejlooc: this is a good place to start
-----
Neptonic: It's a shame the MP is way more boring. It's a pinball game, it doesn't have a scoring mode, it has this circle blazed mode where it has a ball spin in front of you, you need to score the next ball to continue the circle and play circles around it to get a score. It's not that hard to implement these modes, it's just strange to me.
-----
Waxyresidude: I enjoyed playing it out of obligation. The music, the sound effects, the overall physics of it, it is fun.

~!~What would be the best/cheapest way to carry game cases?

TheEchosOfTheCyborg: Being able to carry case after case, cases that are easy to carry, and a quick method for carrying carts and cases. I’ve been looking at options for carrying cases for a while, and thought it’d be interesting to know which one Era really like? Which do you think would be most cost effective and practical to carry around? What I’ve been looking at and narrowing down these options until I can do an exhaustive write up on each.
Case – Nintendo Switch case
Handheld cases – Sony PlayStation 4 Slim case, or the cases used for Switch handhelds
Headset cases – MicroCenter Headset Case, MicroCenter Case, etc
Mic – Nintendo Switch Case, Nintendo Switch cases, Nintendo Switch cases, Nintendo Switch cases, Nintendo Switch cases, and a few others
Backpack cases – Turtle Beach Quick Carry Case, Turtle Beach Quick Carry Case, Nintendo Switch cases, and a Switch Pro Controller Pro Controller Pro Controller Case
 Wire Storage Holder – WD-40 USB Storage Holder, Nintendo Switch Case, Nintendo Switch cases Micro Center PS4 Pro Gaming Headset Case, Nintendo Switch
Steered Wheelchairs – Richardux HG-150 Rapid Fire Wireless Vertically Walking Straps, WD-40 USB Storage Bag, WD-40 USB Type-C Flash Drive, Nintendo Switch
Walking Athletic Sleigh – WD-40 USB Storage Holder, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch cases Micro Center PS4 Pro Gaming Headset Case, Nintendo Switch
-----
Zacmortar: Isnt the case needed for this?
-----
Cartridge Games: Probably the Switch Pro controller.
-----
TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I mean I can’t speak for Nintendo but it’s an interesting option to have options for if that’s what you were going for.
-----
Al3x1s: I'd buy a new case if they could hand off some keys to someone whom they could sell them for a decent price (preferably something that works with other cases like the boxed ones I mentioned).
-----
Al3x1s: I mean I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo had something in that production cycle to make the case work well.
-----
Jraphics Horse: I think the Switch Pro controller is a decent option, it's a cheap controller so
====================
~!~So I just finished the story of Bioshock, and I've been having a blast!

Phendrift: First of all, I’m not talking about the plot. This is about how you actually end up playing the games.
The story is pretty much exactly what I mentioned in the beginning of this post.
The protagonist is your standard scientist.
You have a past that you can use to erase memories off of the girl and create a new one. The girl you play as (the original one), has been in a lab with her own abilities like a hunch phone and a walk-on. She’s a medium saver. She knows what to do and when to use them and also has a set of expectations for you to live up to. She’s a very laid back android. She’s not really going to be a hero but she has this mysterious power that no one can see unless she uses it on you.
The girl you play as has been there your whole life, and she has a little secret that you can’t really tell until the end of the game. She doesn’t actually have a reason to live, she’s made out of fears for her life and she thinks everyone has more of that so she’s trying to be brave and come first.
We end up going to the same lab, from where the girl you play as starts to erase memories off of a girl called a shrink. The girl you play as is a girl who looks like a little girl, they don’t know that’s what she looks like.
The girl you play as is a young guy who looks like a leghold but looks like a bald man.
The girl you play as has a baby girl thing going on and she’s the baby all the time.
I don’t know if this is really the story I was wanting but I’m enjoying it.
The game itself is really cute and generous so I think it’s enough to carry on the feelings you have for the characters.
Overall I really enjoyed the story and I ended up liking it better than the last one.
-----
Caiusto: I enjoyed every single bit of the game.
The game does a fantastic job at making you feel dumb when you play it, in a good way.

~!~Journo: Did you play Phantasy Star before FF?

Maligna: I just beat Phantasy Star for the first time today, and it was my first time playing an RPG. I've played the first two games, Phantasy Star 2 and Phantasy Star novel 2, and I've played a bunch of FF. I've done a ton of side quests and played a ton of mini-games in the RPG genre.
But I've never played a RPG.
And now I'm wondering: Why?
I've been playing the original games of them (they didn't get localized, but there was an English translation, so it was basically a translation podcast), and I've never played a Phantasy Star game.
I know the first game is a bit rough, but I don't know why. I've never played anything like it.
When I was playing the original games, I played the first game. But then I remember my PS1 days and I thought I was just playing a RPG.
But I don't remember anything like it.
What was your first impression on the game?
-----
Abriael: I played it for the first time in mid 2000ish. It's a very good game with some flaws. The combat was very enjoyable, and the story was interesting enough without being overly complex. It was a very cool premise though, if you want some good RPG action!
-----
Rikucrafter: It’s one of my favourite games of all time. A true gem of a fantastic world, and a really charming and nice world to explore.
-----
Mondo: I played it for the first time in 2007 after getting it on PS1. It's great. One of the best games of the generation to me.
-----
Aeana: It's a very good game, easily one of the best RPGs of the past two decades.
-----
mogster7777: I played it on the Vita but I haven’t played a game in years on the system. I’ve tried since and still can’t understand how people act like it’s a mobile FF. It doesn’t feel like a true RPG either. It could be but is not a true one.
The world and setting is great but the writing is weak and the quest designs are very bland.

~!~What are the chances of a new Premium Pass in the next console generation?

entremet: I'm sure many of you have been asking for this for years. It could be a very interesting idea for the next console generation.
I think a new incentive like this could have a very interesting effect on multiplayer games. The Halo games were excellent, but I feel like a new Pass that offers a new set of Gems could actually lead to a fresh and challenging experience for anybody that experienced that.
Even the Halo games are still in the same space and learning to do new moves in the same manner.
But what about you?
-----
Marble: Absolutely.
-----
Dr. Caroll: I think a new free-to-play game is the most likely. You could even have classic Xbox Live servers running, giving players who wanted to play the classics a way to play them without paying for them.
-----
R dott B: Yes.
-----
LewieP: I'd be in if it sold well.
-----
The Living Tribunal: Yes, but I'd need servers to host the games.
-----
TheGhost: I think it's the other way around. But it would be cool to have some new game that's not multiplayer and includes the ability to play with other people or another group.
-----
Flux: I mean if anything is changed, it's likely this will lead to a renewed focus on offline play.
-----
Cess007: I think it's the only viable route.
-----
Cess007: I don't think that, no.

What's your all-time favorite event in gaming? What's your all-time favorite video game moment? Your all-time favorite game, your all-time favorite video game moment (if you can name one).
Mine is probably 2018, followed by 2019, 2020 and 2021

Brat-Sampson: I can't think of a 1000 thing, but I'll include that in my 2018 list.

~!~Mega Man 11’s best game

max.rem: The new game’s box is beautiful. I wish I had spent more time playing the old game.
What’s your favorite game from the box or the most original?
-----
HyGogg: Classic Mega Man. Mega Man's greatest strength is the soundtrack. It's time.
-----
Rockman ZX: Love the Mega Man and Deckard remixes.
-----
HououinKyouma00: I don't know if I had the courage to purchase this game, but I have. 
It's the only Mega Man game I haven't played since the first game on the GBA.
-----
Svart: MGO2 for me.
-----
Frecklestein: The best Mega Man is the soundtrack. The only one I really need was 11. Dont know if it's the best one, but it's pretty good.
-----
RochHoch: I understand why people love Mega Man, but I don't know if I would call it "the best", "the most original", "the best of the lot", "mid tier adventure". It's just the best and most original.
-----
RockmanBN: The soundtrack is just everything. It has some of the best in the series.
-----
Neoxon: I guess that's the draw for the OST.
-----
Rockman ZX: This is a good game but I still feel like I'm playing the best one so far.

~!~How do you feel after beating MH World?

Mondy: I have to say that while I love the game, I am a little disappointed after beating it.
I am not a fan of the map system, but I still think it's a fun system and easily better than World as a whole.
I had a little trouble with the first boss, but I unlocked the second phase and now I think I like it a lot.
I think the lack of bosses was a little inarguable though. The Goombas are rather annoying, but as a whole it's a fun fight.
I also really like how the game is structured. The maps are smaller, they are harder, they are needlessly big, and they are the bosses too.
I'm not big on the lore, but I think there is some good stuff in there.
What are your thoughts?

There's also a demo on itch.io if you're interested in some type of competitive gameplay.

andymcc: Finally! Can't wait for the eventual one-on-one experience with my boy Moira.

Dary: So excited for this. I was never big into the franchise, but the first one is so much fun! This and the Megaman X Legacy Collection are just amazing.
-----
Hero of Legend: I played the original with some of my friends back at launch. Really looking forward to this.
-----
mazi: yeah the first one is really good and was a huge help for me get into the franchise. i played the first mission a few years ago and it was just fun, the 2nd one was just as good and had a great atmosphere. waiting for the 3rd one now.

andymcc: I played the first one and it was good.

I would also like to thank the posters who have been helping me and others figure out all the history and how it all fits together
Some of the people who played the Sony interactive expo were great. Shawn Ashford, Mark Cerny, Shawn Layden, Mark Gerhard, Shawn Layden and Mark Lafferty
All winners are invited!

kennyamr: I would think that Shawn has a good shot at being the face of Sony, but I don't think he will be the face of the console.

Memento: Awesome video

TheInfinityGauntlet: Shawn's face makes a lot of sense

Acquiescence: I think this video is going to be a sold-out thing for people who've been to see what people are working on for a long time. I don't think it's particularly evocative of Sony to be honest.

SweetSark: About:
------------
The patch for No Man Sky Next has been released.
The following notes were added to the changelog:
- Patch 1.7.0 was not released yet.
- Patch 1.7.0 was not released yet.
The next patch will address some technical issues.
--------------
So, this is next month.
There is still no new patch for this game.
-----
SweetSark: I know.
But I hope they don't forget that a huge mistake we made during the alpha and it will be too late to push another update.
For comparison,
-----
SweetSark: Now, they need to support the PS4 Pro and Xbone X first.
-----
Dartastic: No Man's Sky GOAT
-----
SweetSark: They are still missing two big things.
1) Resolution. They have to support both the Ps4 Pro and Xbone X.
2) Resolution. Although they have moved to 1080p, they cannot scale to 16:9.
So it is a 4:3 aspect ratio and they need to support it.
They need to support 4K and 4K60.
They need to support a 4K60.

SweetSark: So they need to support 4K and 4K60.
They are not going to support 4K for a game.

~!~What’s the best console to play with for indies?

Parenegade: I’ve been interested in buying a Switch lately since the E3 sale and I’ve been wondering what kind of controller I can use. I know that the Pro controller and a controller using gyro are becoming more popular recently.
I’m already thinking about picking up a DS4. But I’m wondering if I can use my Switch Pro controller and D-Pad with the Switch?
-----
Hieroph: I only have a PS4 controller (which I don't use) and the Switch Pro Controller is too loud.
-----
Stopdoor: I don't know how to answer this, but the Switch pro controller is great. The gyro is essentially flawless, I love it.
-----
DrakenAstro: Nothing beats the Pro controller
-----
Parenegade: How do you use the gyro?
-----
IvanZ: As soon as I got my Switch, I heard about the gyro. I'd be using it with my PS4 controller.
-----
Parenegade: So you only use it with the Pro controller?
-----
Camstun187: I feel like it’s kinda cheating to say the Switch Pro controller is the best controller ever for indies.
-----
FernandoRocker: Does the DS4 count?

Xtortion: I didn't even realize it was 28. The game is a buggy mess at times. I've been waiting for a sale.

Makoto Yuki: This is awesome, I love this series.

Fat4all: i was just about to post this

Klobrille: I remember being really addicted to Chaos;Child. This is a really good game.

Krvavi Abadas: Game was fun, but i'm about tired of games where the main character is a 23 year old demon-wizard that wrecks your house in a trillion because he can't fit a 6 foot pole on a school bus.

~!~How many of you still play your 3DS?

mazi: i just realized after thinking about it. since i have a long story backlog, i decided to actually finish some of my 3DS backlogs.
my 3DS backlog consists of:
my 3DS collection:
a 4chan:
a bunch of "midgen" consoles:
a bunch of "midgen" portable devices:
a bunch of 3DS games i already own:
a huge pile of 3DS games:
a huge amount of games i already know:
and a list of games i never played:
-----
vestan: I mean, it's probably not a lot but as someone that's never owned a 3DS I can definitely see the amount of things I've bought. I've also been pretty lucky with multiple consoles and many 3rd party games being prominently featured on Nintendo hardware.
-----
mazi: well, i bought it, and it was a handheld system. not a huge backlog but i bought it.
so that's pretty good.
-----
Usyren: I mean, it's not a lot but it's a lot when you consider the fact that up until recently, the 3DS was the only console I owned. I had a DSi hooked up to my TV and phone and a GBA (I still carry a DSi with Game Boy in from time to time). My family has a PS4 and a PS3 but they only play on the Switch and only play exclusives(Smash,Xenoblade, etc) if I buy them exclusives on Switch. I have a PSP go and a PS3 and a XB1. I don't game on my Switch and I only game with Xbox and non multiplats.
-----
mazi: ok, so it's not a lot, but it's a lot when you consider that it's basically a souped up 3DS with no 3rd party games.
-----
skeezx: i guess the only 3rd party games i've ever played on 3DS were mario kart 8 and odin sphere
-----
Hero: I bought it for the 3DS mainly because of the exclusives and I've been playing it on the 3DS daily.
I'm glad to hear it's not a lot.
-----
mazi: ouch, my bad. i haven't played any of the 3

~!~What if next gen consoles have a off gen version of Mario?

OmegaDL50: Talking to a few people in a board room in Tokyo, I was wondering what if Mario and his friends will be at the top of their game ever released. One of them was planning to get a SNES classic because he just loves Mario. The other one is planning to get a SNES classic if it's coming out after the Pro down the line.
I was wondering what if it's next gen. It seems like this generation is shaping up to be very similar to last gen for the next gen for Mario. Obviously a lot of this is due to launches timing, but what if this generation is actually different to the last one and the next one?
I'm in the middle of redoing some lessons for myself and I'm wondering if it's worth doing this for my younger brothers and daughters. I'm wondering if it's worth catching up on Mario and their other franchises.
I'm also curious about the level of portability for this game, I kind of want to play it in portable but they seem to have way too many other games to play on my PS3/360 to do this, is the whole thing just barely playable in portable mode?
Again, I used to play a lot of Mario 64 and Sunshine, but I don't think these games are well suited to play in portable. I'm also not sure what the general consensus is on this.
-----
Rygar 8Bit: At least the best version of a modern Mario is the one made for the Gamecube, which is what I would consider a classic.
I wouldn't recommend playing Super Mario 64 or Sunshine to someone outside of their younger self, if you can call it that.
-----
Zalman: Mario 64 and Sunshine are extremely easy to port to modern hardware.
Mario World is very easy to emulate on the WiiU.
Mario 64 and Sunshine are very different games.
-----
OmegaDL50: While I wouldn't recommend playing Mario 64 or Sunshine to your younger self, I think this is a pretty good guide to other games that modern Mario games will have a ton of control over such as ARMS, New Super Mario Bros., and even the 3DS titles.
-----
Mushroomer25: I think the issue is that it's a game that needs to be played every generation. Nintendo's 3D platformers simply don

~!~What is the best way to play RDR and Witcher 3 on PC these days?

Camel: I never played RDR or Witcher 3 on PC before but I find that there are a lot of great companion companion companion games for PC like Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption and Witcher 3 all have companion companion companion companion games. What are the best ways to play these games on PC? I had never played any of these before but now I have a lot of fun with the Witcher 3 and Witcher 3 companion companion companion companion companion games.
Thanks!
-----
Lashley: You can, but it's a little prite to mess around with and there's not much to it.
-----
newmoneytrash: Witcher 3 is great, but it's also prite. Amazing game and has some of the best open world moments I've seen in a while, even if its very linear and story wise
-----
Camel: I've heard good things about Witcher 3. I just haven't been sure about what it's like.
-----
Lashley: Yeah, there's some really fun ways to play it. I played through it a few years ago and had a blast, but it's still not the cream of the crop and I don't know if it's aged well.
-----
Alo81: Witcher 3 is worth checking out.
Witcher 3 is a very different experience.
The third game is more open world.
-----
Camel: Thanks for the suggestion.
-----
hydruxo: Yeah I played RDR last year and loved it to death but I can't recommend it highly enough. The witcher 3 companion companion is fantastic and has a huge following.
-----
Raijinto: Witcher 3 is on its best time to play. It has some rough spots but the core package of the game is fantastic and really makes you feel like a Witcher 3 player rather than a paladin trying to do the quests. I believe it is the best companion companion game of the year.
-----
Camel: I didn't really have any issues with the visuals at first but man I ran low on blood so I had a rough grip with the combat. Once you do the witcher 3 questline and a bit further in, it feels a bit more responsive and fun. The other companion companion quests are also fun as well.
-----

====================
~!~Subjectivity and Discourse on the Switch has turned me off a bit.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Basically.
I'm confused. I expected Nintendo to be the most reactive platform I've ever seen, but Switch has just made things way more reactive. Things are ambiguous. I can't act like an OS is "obsolete", I can't react to news and news items, I can't use my phone. But that's all just my usual methods of playing games and I've been made to realize this is probably a worse experience than I'd wished for.
The Switch is the most open platform I've ever experienced. I can play my PS4 and XBO games with ease. I can take my Switch in and out of gamescons. I can pause the UI to make sure my saves are safe. I can browse the eShop without getting up and changing anything. I can even play my Switch in bed and in other rooms.
I've been trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I can't just turn the Switch on and off like I can on a TV. I have to take the system into the living room. It's a nightmare at first. It's as if I have to keep the door to the kitchen locked. And if I have to take my Switch in and out of the house. It's just not intuitive. It's a nightmare.
All my life I spent playing games in a comfy couch for an hour a day. I have no control over the system. I have to be able to move, react, react, scream. It's like my life was changed. I don't want to feel a "I'm not happy when I have the console". I don't want to have to adapt to an unbearable gaming setup. I don't want to be treated as an "Other" when playing games.
I'm sorry. I understand. I'm not trying to be nice. I just don't want to feel nice.
Edit: I'm sorry for venting.
-----
Nights: I feel like Nintendo is the only company I've ever been able to play video games with. I don't think I can handle it, but I've had some great times with it. I'd definitely be a Switch Buyer myself.

~!~What to expect from RE2 remake and why?

StuBurns: RE2 is due to release next Tuesday, and I can't help but wonder what it will look like. RE2 is known for having some of the most beautiful and imaginative environments in the series, with the original PSX RE2 looking amazing in 4K, but the REmake-esque design that was done for the remake was just... not great.
My question is: what's the best looking way of re-imagining these games? I'm not asking for photorealistic graphics (I'd prefer flat textures but I'm open to suggestions), but what about the lighting (especially hair texture)? 
I also expect the first game to switch things up, but I don't know if they're going to go for more exotic stuff like guns. 
I'd also like the way both Leon and Claire can play. They seem to be the same in 2, but I imagine there'd be some special touches to both Leon and Claire's combat. 
What do you all think? What are your expectations for RE2 remake?
-----
Kenzodielocke: I expect a fully blown remake of 2.
-----
Masterspeed: I expect RE2 to be used as a setting for the third game. I don't think it'll be a remake, but it'll be an artistic overhaul for the style of game that's been on current gen consoles.
-----
Caiusto: I dont expect much from RE2.
-----
AgentOtaku: I don't expect a remake, but I do expect RE2 to have a bunch of really awesome looking worlds.
I expect the assets to be scaled to the original RE2 standard, and the lighting/reflection system to be completely re-imaged and re-contextualized.
I don't expect a full blown remake either, but I do expect a complete recreation of what's been seen in 2.
-----
CannonFodder52: 1. 
2.
-----
Omar310: I expect them to go for a more grounded story, and it should be mostly grounded enough. Some minor gimmicks and an open world would be neat, but I don't expect them to go in a comic style.

====================
~!~"The Mummy Dem". How will it work?

MegaManTrigger: I recently started playing The Mummy Dem, a remake of the 1996 game that originally only released in Japan as The Mummy Demos, originally for the NES. The game is divided into 2 regions: the peaceful one, the violent one and the disturbing one. In this game, you are the six demon children that are chasing the evil cultists. You have a lot of choice in what you do. The game is very linear, you can choose the area of the map you wish in the fashion of the original game. There are six areas that you can visit in the game. You can walk to any place in the game and in each area you will encounter other kids chasing after you. The game also has a multi-directional boost mode, where your jumping becomes more powerful when you are over the water level.
I think The Mummy Dem should be remade to be closer to the original, with a different feeling of exploration. It is pretty much a linear game, you can go to most points in the map, but when you return to the area of interest, it will be very chaotic. This makes exploration too difficult, but the multiple paths you take are not that dangerous. You have to find and clear all six areas of secrets. There are six puzzles to solve. You can use your six bombs and bombs to solve part of the puzzles. You have access to a variety of weapons.
The game is also very fast paced and has many collectibles. It is also very fast paced, but the puzzles and puzzles are very difficult. It will be really confusing at times. It is not compulsory to explore, it is a puzzle game. You will have to explore the map, but you can enjoy the feeling of just finishing the game.
I would like to recommend the following games that I would recommend to play the game on easy:
Monster Hunter World
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Final Fantasy XV
Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition
Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age
The following is only a small list of the games I would recommend to play on easy (i.e. no RPG Limit Medals), but you can check these games out if you don't mind a slower pace.
The following would be recommended to you if you don't mind playing them on easy:
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask

====================
~!~Diablo Immortal is one of the best games of this generation and the most interesting 2019 game

More_Badass: I've been playing it for the first time in a year, and damn, I really like it
I'm not going to lie, it's a lot more fun than Hearthstone. Lots of different options, lots of different builds, lots of different strategies, and the meta is really fun.
The first thing I noticed while playing was how much of the game seemed to change at once. Suddenly, every single new area, dungeon, or whatever felt completely different. There were no longer all of the interesting things to do in the recent zones, no longer seen as a threat from Cataclysm, no longer seen as a fucking joke (I mean, that's Blizzard, but still)
The dungeons have always been fun, and the new changes have really made things interesting, but it still feels like a game that's been missing the magic with the most recent patch.
Anyone else playing this yet? How is the game now?
-----
Why would you do that?: I played it for the first time in years. I actually really like it.
It's one of those games that only came around late-game. I just started over a week or two ago. I really like all the different gameplay systems, the insane difficulty, the systems designed around it, etc.
I think it's the best Diablo I've played in years.
-----
Masterspeed: I'm only about an hour in, but I'm absolutely loving it. I'm a big fan of Diablo 1 and 2, and this is no different. It's just faster, more fun.
-----
Aokiji: It’s my most played game ever. I really love it.
-----
Ahasverus: I enjoyed it so much I played through it 3 times. Only thing I would change is to play a bit more regularly.
-----
skeezx: one of the best games I've ever played, a shame the game got progressively more shit from user unfollowing.
-----
butman: I hope this game is good.
-----
Masterspeed: It is great, but it feels like how Diablo games feel, at least at my own. I don't think I've ever felt this passionate about a game, except for when the sequel got released. I mean, I love Diablo 1

~!~Ubisoft talks about the challenges of moving forward

Nirolak: Source: 
Ubisoft blog post:
-----
Toumari: I'm glad the game did well, but a lot of the high points are the things I wish I knew.
-----
Phantom Thief: I disagree with the general sentiment, but I’m still disappointed that they didn’t do a raid in the sequel.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m from the future now, and I can only speak for a few months at this point. It’s the past two years now, she says. “We’ve been doing raids for the sake of closure,” he says. “The fans were pissed and upset, but they didn’t mess with the game beyond delivering content and a few other things.”
-----
Orayn: The raid was a combination of the visual novel and persona the player had played. It had a good structure that worked very well. The raid itself was a side quest with some unique sidequests. The regular raid was a longish story around different raid fights in the various areas of the game.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m still upset about the closure of the raid, but I’m pretty confident they didn’t do much with it.
-----
Saint-14: How is this game not popular enough for them?
-----
Phantom Thief: I swear I thought they would have done something had they been doing a lot more of the content for the game instead of just doing raides.
And that’s why we haven’t seen anything about a raid in the sequel.
-----
Phantom Thief: Now, I’m not saying that’s the case, but I’m thinking that they should have focused on getting more content for the game instead of just doing what they did for the first game.
-----
Orayn: The raids were about the main story of the game for me. They were about the raid itself, it was about the whole raid itself, the final boss. It was about the ending, the end. And the final boss.

~!~LttP: The Witcher 3 - The Fall of Boberg

Wollan: I think this is the most overrated video in the "Other" category.
I really enjoyed it. I think it reflects well on CDPR and the potential of the CD Projekt Red vision for The Witcher 3. The story is decent with some cool twists and turns and the combat is good. I think it's the epitome of cinematic storytelling and wow-whomp!
For context, I was a bit underwhelmed with the first season of The Witcher 3. I feel the other, a more realistic one at that. Everything felt so limiting, pointlessly linear and repetitive. I liked how it was constantly vying for player competition with side quests, asking questions of NPC's why they're doing what they do. I always felt like the "game" aspect was missing. It feels like you're in a completely different world.
The game is paced incredibly well and it is a joy to play. I enjoyed the puzzles and how you solve them but in the end it was about competition and not what you do. I stayed glued to the events and made choices that affected other stuff. 
The Witcher 3 was a product of its time. By the time I was finished with it, I thought: "Wow, Witcher 3 is one of the best games this generation."
So I've decided to complete The Witcher 3.
I have some minor trophies to do...
Spoiler
...and then a quest involving a group of outlaws and some gang members.
Spoiler
...I'm a bit underwhelmed. I really enjoy the story and characters but the open world is a bit lifeless. The side quests were particularly dull. The open world was a lot more interactive with the world being real and everything being possible.
Spoiler
I'm not sure if I'm feeling The Witcher 3 the correct way to play but I'm curious how others feel
-----
Kolx: I'm pretty much the same way. I think the way I play is that I follow the story book/dungeons/whatever and while I like the stories in games I despise the way the game wants me to play it. The Witcher 1 was just too obtuse and did not fit in that direction.
-----
ASilentProtagonist: I'm pretty much the same way. I get the open world and all but I'm not really

~!~New Battle Royale Game Teasing Possible E3 Surprise

Hattori: A new Battle Royale Game is teasing a possible reveal this year, according to a tweet from developer Nate Mitchell.
Mitchel goes into great details about the game:
Game looks fun though, wonder if it can be monetized at least.
If so:
-----
jelly: Battle Royale
-----
Sou Da: That looks to be the most generic and uninspired looking game I've ever seen
-----
Fat4all: that's the actual name of this game
-----
Hattori: It's called Battle Royale, but it's the first game teased, so not too specific.
-----
Kyougar: I dont know. They already teased a name that would leak at E3, I think its "The Flintie".
-----
Hattori: I think this is it, the other game is a teaser.
I dont know why you make a thread on a popular game, I dont like it.
-----
mudai: No screenshots, but this one looks like the most uninspired looking game I have seen in a while. I hope it's monetized, or even more than that, more like, like Fortnite Battle Royale.
-----
Mushroomer25: I'm so intrigued. The concept is brilliant, and the execution is almost on point.
-----
Kyougar: You could have just posted this in another thread.

~!~DD Zeldas - An Adventure Guide

Driggonny: Came across this book recently and was blown-away. It is by Tom Nook who did the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest: Heroes. He's a long-time Dragon Quest fan who loved Dragon Quest Heroes. 
You can read his books on gog, net, epic store, and mobile.
He also seems to have a pretty good summary of the history of the series.
I've only finished the first four chapters but would like to dive in on the rest.
-----

CannonFodder52: I remember enjoying this.
Already have DQV and the other two series I've missed out on; I really hope this one is good.
-----
Starlatine: Interesting read, I agree with a lot of the points in the OP
Hope this one is better than the first and is also a really good read
-----
Keym: I've been meaning to pick this up someday. I've heard some good things about the series.
-----
Lemstar: oh my god, I've been waiting for this one. I love the idea of a dragon's adventure. one that's basically a direct sequel to Dragon Quest and doesn't play like a Dragon Quest game, but with more of the same.

I have no idea if it is done or not but it seems to me like they will announce the new project soon.
-----
Cess007: I wonder if they will announce it for PC or they will release it on console
-----

Elven_Star: Doubtful. It's been a few months since they announced it, and they didn't have a concrete date.
-----
Chivalry: Doubtful.
-----
DangerMouse: I'd be interested.
-----

TailorDKS: I think it should be announced for PC first.
They said its coming to consoles.
-----
Savinowned: I thought they had to reboot it? I thought it was for Xbone/PS4?
-----
dex3108: It was announced for PC earlier and they were pretty clear about it no different to Shadow of Tomb Raider.

Masterspeed: I wish there were a bunch of new levels to the old one if just to get us back into the classic style.
-----
KZXcellent: I don't think it's in yet. That's a tease.

~!~Do you think that the Switch's hardware and software combo will reach the heights of the PS4, The PS2, and Gamecube, but at the same time, do you think it will perform worse?

Memento: The thing with Nintendo games is that they are just as bad as their consoles, and even less graphically interesting than the PS4 and Xbone. So, I dont think that they will be better, at least not graphically. But, if we assume that the Switch's hardware and software combo will reach the same level of quality as the PS4 and Xbone, do you think it will be marginally better? Or will it get worse?
-----
spineduke: It'll be graphically interesting, but it won't be graphically interesting.
-----
Aters: A lot of games won't sell that well. It will get cheaper.
-----
GayAnimeDad: You won’t get any better. It’s not like Nintendo can put out anything better than the PS2 and Xbox 360. Just look at the sales of the Wii and Wii U. They were able to exceed expectations. 
PS4 and Xbone will continue to sell after their first year in the market.
-----
Chauzu: It’ll get graphically better, but it won’t be graphically interesting.
-----
Memento: Actually, do you mean for a technical comparison ? Because im confused
-----
SuperBlank: It'll be graphically better, but that won't be a good comparison.
-----
Raysoul: It'll get better, but not graphically.
-----
Memento: Well, the Switch doesn't get any more graphically impressive than the PS2/Xbox One.
-----
Zalman: I hope not. They won't be better. But I expect them to get better performance and higher resolution.

~!~What's the best Gaming Gaming Video?

Pillock: With the Ultimate Xbox bundle announced and now coming to Xbox One and PS4, I'd like to know what you think is the best gaming video you've watched.
I'm leaning towards the Microsoft one. It has some of the most creative set pieces I've ever seen. It's also really funny!
-----
Plum: I've been watching a lot of the Giantbomb Quick Look videos and it's always been something to do in the video editing realm. I just uploaded a few minutes ago and thought it was pretty good!
-----
Cess007: I saw this earlier.
Not sure if it's funnier than I imagined, but it's great.
-----

Theorry: "The video is much funnier"
Haha good to know.
-----
Sonicfan059: From Wikipedia.
-----
Flux: I watched the Giant Bomb Quick Look a few weeks ago and it was definitely funny. I think one of the things they changed was changing the play area to be more like the E3 one, and I think changing it because of the Game Awards.
-----
Garrett 2U: I watched the Microsoft one last week and the editing was just awful. The editing of the trailer was just the editor in chief having to go sit through fucking pages of editing notes that have nothing to do with the actual show lol. It was like they had no idea what they were doing and then they had to change it.

Powerofthecloud: UKwise the thread was made before and this is the first response so it isn't exactly ready yet.

KrangBakesaTurtle: With the new year fast approaching and the rumors of a new Harry Potter game, it got me wondering if the team behind the series has anything left? I know they haven't published a single game in their series (hopefully) but have the license for a few.
-----
Sorel: They only published 3 games for PS1.
-----
kennyamr: That's just Harry Potter.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: They're saving the best girl games for PS5.
-----
Aters: They've been working on the series for three years. They just started publishing more games in 2018 and I can't remember where they are.
-----
Gundam: I'm pretty sure the last game was on PS4, and that was in 2013.
-----
Aters: They've been going at it for 3 years now.
-----
HussiZooT: They just started doing series (hopefully) for the PS4.

KrangBakesaTurtle: I'm just on the next one ;) I never played the first games and the first game was on PS3, so I don't know the status of the current ones.

~!~Have we seen a better example of this than the new God of War?

Phantom Thief: Okay, so I’m replaying the new God of War, and I’m replaying Spider-Man, and I’m replaying Kingdom Come Deliverance.
I’m replaying them, and I’m in a big rush to play them, because I’m starting to feel like I’m just getting back into the God of War train, and I’m about to go back to my lost loves and hates.
I have a huge backlog of stuff to play. I’ve just done an inordinate amount of side content, and then on the other side, I’ve just finished all the side stories, which are, in my opinion, far shorter than the main story.
I’m not even talking about side quests, and I’m just talking about side quests.
I remember that one side quest in the GOW NG+ where you have to get a certain amount of XP for a specific statue of sigillity, which is quite a task but which requires a lot of effort. I think I’m gonna do just that, but with that XP, I didn’t really need to do everything, but I realized that some of them were pretty short.
I’m quite fond of the FFXII side questline, which I’m gonna call “Fairy Tales”. I’m probably probably not far into the second DLC, but it’s a pretty long side quest and I could do with some of the more interesting side questlines popping up.
The other side I’m fond of is the Chocobo’s Quest DLC, which is a lot of fun. It starts out pretty well, but a little slow and too slow, with a lot of backtracking, and a little rushed, with very little to do, with a lot of backtracking, and a lot of backtracking, and the story is just not very good, with the whole world is just empty, and you have to backtrack many times, and you get sidetracked, and there’s a lot of confusing stuff that you didn’t know you had to do. The side stories are pretty good, but not very good either.
So I’m sort

~!~Forza Horizon 4 and its HDR support on PC

J_Viper: Hi all.
I have a PC hooked up to a TV with HDR support enabled and I have noticed that the game is still washed out on my XB1X, despite using HDR. I was able to fix it simply by playing the game in its original resolution and using the max luminance slider (I think it's the same value as my TV's HDR slider? I haven't tested it)
I've tried other downsampling, supersampling and enhanced LOD and it seems that none of them do anything to the image. 
This is my PC and all I know is that it does the "Drain The Dish" gesture which looks odd at default brightness and recommended value (about the same as my TV's recommended value)
Is there a way I can get around this? Can someone point me in the right direction?
-----
Crayon: I'm not sure.
-----
Ferrio: Not sure what you're looking for. You can check on the forums or something.
-----
J-1: Thank you. Might look like I'm playing a updated version of the game lol
-----
Shawn The Wonder: I'm not sure what you're looking for but it seems to be a noticeable difference.
-----
Windu: there's a reason someone made a thread on it.
-----
Coolade: It's because it's a 4k TV.
-----
J_Viper: Sorry! I was just wondering about this. I can be easily fooled, I'm sure. I just thought I'd share

Fry Rumple: Looks like you get the best of both worlds. I hope you keep us updated.

~!~Are any remasters on the horizon?

IbizaPocholo: We are all aware that we are in the next year, starting with next-gen consoles, but with that in mind, are we doing the right thing?
I would like to ask this too.
With the PS4 also seeing some nice remasters, I thought it was good to see.
I have been looking for a remaster of Final Fantasy VII
I have been wanting to play this for years
I have been waiting for FFVIII
I recently bought the Mario & Sonic 2 HD trilogy
Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite games of all time and I feel like I am playing the right path here with a good amount of enjoyment.
-----
Regulus Tera: I don't think VII or VIII are going to happen.
That being said, I would love a remake of the original Metal Gear Solid.
-----
Cess007: I think we're doing something already. I mean, I kinda wish the series could continue on with even more story and characters
-----
IbizaPocholo: Please, please...
-----
KZXcellent: I think we are. I don't see it coming anytime soon.
-----
Chocobo Blade: I hope in the future.
-----
Cess007: Well, I mean, there's a good chance the next MGS will be a remaster, but I'm still worried about that.
-----
Cess007: I mean, it's not like it's happening ... but I can easily see it happening.
-----
The Last Wizard: I am not. I could see it happening. I mean, it would be nice to see it, but it would be way harder to remaster MGS1-3 and 4 than it is now.
-----
IbizaPocholo: And we still have a PS1 classics collection on PSN.

~!~Does anyone else miss the fishing in Xenoblade Chronicles 2?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I know it's gone, but I was never that much of a fan of the first game's fishing.
I think the best way to compensate for that would be to do the standard fishing right away, and then immediately get the crystal oracles coming out of them (preferably before the final boss).
And the fishing was a chore... 
Also, I remember liking the fishing in the opening battles in 1 while I was out.
-----
Farrac: I miss the fishing. It's a relic from the past. Let's not blame it if we don't remember the good old days.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: Just use the normal fishing as a means to get to the crystal caves.
-----
Rndom Grenadez: I miss it. I should be doing everything in my free time before the end game.
-----
Grexeno: I miss it as well.
-----
hibikase: I hope the art is better in the new engine.
-----
Rndom Grenadez: I’m playing the game on Switch. The lag is very bad. I’m doing the standard fishing.
-----
NKnight7: I miss it.
-----
Strings: I dunno, the random encounters in the first half are pretty annoying, and the fishing is not really fun. It's fine in the second half, tho - just remember that you can do all the previous islands in the first game, so you'll be able to explore all the islands. :P
-----
mrmickfran: Seems like the fishing is really going to be the only way to do the game. I'm personally not fond of it, but I think they're going to have to add some sort of form to the combat to make it better as well. I really hope the expansion is good, I really want to explore all of Nalateria.

====================
~!~Why do I need to click on a box every time a new trailer comes out?

oni-link: I've noticed this in a few trailers, particularly the ones with cutscenes, so this is for clarification
I've always known that once a trailer comes out, I'll click on the box to get the game informer to do it, but never once clicking on the box to get the game informer to do it
I've noticed this in trailers for a few games that I've been playing lately, including the latest ones I've yet to play
Why does it always happen?
-----
Cybersai: Because they'll sell worse on Days Gone.
-----
oni-link: I'm sure Days Gone would've bombed anyway
-----
Much: It happens when a game has a huge marketing campaign.
-----
Aztechnology: Yea, it happens sometimes. Even games I'm not even gonna buy, I just look at the box to buy the game and say "I'll wait until the game comes out."
I think it's more about marketing. If a game has a really good rating and I don't feel like waiting, I'll go ahead and buy it.
-----
Daitokuji: Same reason why I buy games when they come out.
-----
Deleted member 15538: Usually I just click the box to pre-order the game.
-----
Rodjer: Days Gone and Spider-Man I am not gonna skip even if it fails.
-----
chandoog: Yeah, the likes of Detroit Become Human, Horizon and the upcoming The Last of Us all have previews probaby coming out soon, which means it will be added I believe.
-----
DrakenAstro: I don't skip the boxes I always wait.

====================
~!~I was hyped for the first Resident Evil: Revelations 2, I never realized that it has this much survival horror DNA

Dreamboum: I think it's mostly due to the fact that Resident Evil is a long time franchise now, where you have to build your franchise around survival horror for a long time. It's not that RE is the genre of the 15-20 years ago era, it's that it's grown a lot in those years and its extremely survival horror is still relevant in the modern era. It's not that I think Resident Evil is the genre of today, I think the very first survival horror game is about the survival horror.
After RE7 I was pretty hyped for RE2, I wasn't really sold either, it just made me a bit more interested in RE2. I really hated the first one, but RE2 is the best one, I also really liked Haunting Ground, it has the best level design and atmosphere in the series. I also prefered TEW Sherlock Holmes over the first one, I really wanted to see more about David Marston and his twisted relationship with Mia.
I never realized how much of a genius he is, when I first played it, but this game is one of the greatest game designers of all time, I've never been this hyped for a game before. I've always preferred Silent Hill to the mainline series, but this game is the best one by far, even though it has the least twists and reveals. I really love the puzzles, I really liked how they were integrated in a puzzle-free experience, and I really liked how the mansion was a nice mix of old and modern, the story was very good, the graphics were stunning, I liked how the rain made the game look more cartoony. I really liked how you had to keep your tools for the rain, it really adds to the atmosphere. I also prefered the less subversive themes compared to the Outbreak games
I was also pretty hyped for TEW, but now I'm just not hyped, I really loved it, I really liked the mechanics, I liked the puzzles and the setting was really interesting. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the art style of the game. I wanted to play it in VR, but I guess that's not really what Capcom has been advertising here.
I've come to the point where I really want to play TEW as a survival horror game. I

~!~Did Nintendo re-hire Kazuma Kiryu?

delete12345: I don't think the game was ever re-released in some form, and I don't think there's a "Kiryu" in the title.
But I think it's the fact that it was brought up in a Nintendo Direct that prompted Kiryu to comment about the backlash of the game being re-released on Nintendo Switch. I think this has the merit of stemming the spread of the "Kiryu"/"Kiryu" genre in Japan.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it was only ever made by a single person?
Probably didn’t sell well enough
-----
Kyoufu: I think it's safe to say they never made it.
-----
delete12345: I know what I am, and I'm not sure why anyone would buy the game.
-----
Mr. President: I thought it was a joint Nintendo-Kazuma relations stunt.

~!~Was FEZ my first time playing and relaxing game?

Krvavi Abadas: So... after saving the game for a few hours, I was happy to see that FEZ was still kicking.
I'm going to be playing it right now anyway, because it's a puzzle game where you have to make an inventory full of pins, and it's a lot of fun.
The story seems pretty interesting, and the music seems really good (I haven't heard of the sequel).
Gameplay and cutscenes is my favorite cutscene, and I quite enjoyed the boss battles. There's a ton of QTEs too, and I didn't miss 1 of them.
I want to buy it, but I'll be saving it.
-----
violent: Not my first time, but it has not been my favorite. I'm probably going to re-play it in the future, because I don't want to go through the same level again, but it's not my first time.
-----
UsoEwin: I was absolutely not impressed. It's a good game, but it's not my first Zelda. I feel like I have done it before and I appreciate how much better it is than the others.
-----
The Real Napsta: Not my first
-----
RochHoch: It's my 3rd favorite until The Wind Waker.
I don't think it's my first, but I probably was the first, but it's definitely the first that I've felt that it was worth exploring.
-----
Tibarn: I was really, really disappointed that the first Story Dungeon was not added to the first DLC.
-----
KNTomg: It's my first Zelda. I had played the excellent Wind Waker and Wind Waker Pocket Camp, so it has been a long time since I played them both and had longed to play them.
One thing that I always appreciate is that the dungeons in this game are relatively open, with little backtracking.
-----
KNTomg: I'd say in spite of the music, it is still a great game. I mean, it is, but still. It's got some issues, but its also doable.
-----
KNTomg: I know, though I still feel they're not that.
