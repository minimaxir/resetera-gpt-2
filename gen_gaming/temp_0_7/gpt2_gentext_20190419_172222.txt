~!~Assassin's Creed Odyssey: What's Next?

dex3108: Ubisofts new game is Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the first one was Origins and we haven't seen much of it and I'm pretty sure they will probably stop at the end of the new year
-----
Kyoufu: The last game was Watch_Dogs 2.
-----
Aokiji: Watch Dogs 2 was a sequel to Watch Dogs 1.
-----
Reinhard: I think both will be finished in 2020, either Watch Dogs 1 or 2.
-----
Punished Dan: I think the next one is going to be ready for Fall 2020.
-----
AshenOne: I have no clue, could be a bit late but i think a sequel to one of the best games of the year could be released in 2020.
-----
Baccus: No time skip. It's probably going to be a cookie cutter Ubisoft product.
-----
Patitoloco: They need to release it like every other AAA game in the next year or two.
-----
The Last Wizard: Watch Dogs 2 is a good game. 
That game is still really fun but i’d be playing it in 3d.

~!~The Last of Us Part II: Lack of Player Freedom, Camera, and Aiming

Fiery Phoenix: So I was reading through some of the previews and watching some of the gameplay videos. As someone who absolutely LOVES the cinematic storytelling in this industry, I was very excited to see how Ellie would react to the way Ellie is playing the sandbox mission mode in the original. My thoughts exactly. 
The Last of Us: The Last of Us: The final mix.
I really like the cinematic approach in this game. The way it allows for different gameplay mechanics to be integrated together to create a satisfying and powerful experience. 
The way She is able to react to situations. 
The way the controls work. 
The way the weapons feel. 
The way they respond to enemies. 
I am really hoping Joel and Ellie can work out. 
This is my second pick for the game and I really enjoyed what I saw. 
Would love to see this style of storytelling in the sequel. 
So what are your thoughts on it?
-----
Theorry: Nothing really controversial.
-----
KoolAid: I like it.
-----
Joule: I like it. It's good. At the very least, it's good.
-----
MillionIII: It’s very similar to ME1 except with guns and less health, but yeah.
-----
Flux: I like it. One of the main things I love about the original is how the narrative focus on mental illness. I'd be willing to play with the protagonist to see if they have any issues and I hope they don't.
-----
mogster7777: I didn’t really like it. First of all I don’t think it’s really that similar to ME1 in the gameplay department. I think it’s a lot easier to pick up on than a corridor mission. And shooting is slower. Second, I don’t really like it. I think it’s a lot easier to shoot a deer than a bear. But I do think the gameplay part of it is tougher and it doesn’t really have much follow. And I think the graphics look a lot better.
I think it’s really clunky but I don’t know if it’s because it’s a beautiful game.

~!~What is the best way to download a digital copy of Kingdom Hearts 3?

Troll: I have a PS2 that I’ve been interested in ever since the first game. I’ve downloaded the first 3D world, the first 3D world on disc 2, and the first KH1 digital download. I have my eyes on this one. Is there a Safe Mode to install this digitally to preserve the game for a while?
-----
phanphare: that was my plan, i think i rented some from my mom for christmas.
i think you could just move the storage up the whole thing, but is there an official Safe Mode that comes with a copy to preserve it for a while?
-----
Kazuhira: Yes, there is an easy way. You can just clear your HDD and press Volume Up.
-----
hydrophilic attack: you can
-----
steviestar3: I can't remember the safe mode, but there is an option that allows you to move the whole thing? I don't remember having any issues with moving it, but maybe I should just download the game from the web store instead.
-----
Troll: Is the file system accessed through a menu or do I need to delete the entire thing?
-----
ZangBa: Reinstalling the game for good? I thought moving everything was like the game itself.
-----
Kazuhira: Yes you can. yes you can
-----
hydrophilic attack: is that the only safe mode you can have as an existing game at all?
not an "move all over and get all of everything" but you don't have to delete all the stuff just copy-paste. you don't need to delete but you don't have to delete the entire thing and you don't need to delete it until you are done

~!~[Variety] The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Is the Best Zelda Game Ever Made

Phantom Thief: "I think it looks like Super Mario Bros. Please don't try that. It's at the point where people will suggest it's the best Zelda game and it's going to be the best Zelda game ever made."

-----
Ishida: I'm actually quite excited for this game and agree it looks amazing. It was already great when it first came out, but the controls are so perfect I'm actually having a hard time thinking of any other games that can match it. 
Also, I don't think it's the best Zelda game...but I agree it looks amazing.
-----
KZXcellent: I'm really excited for this game. I just hope the story is as fleshed out and fleshed out as BotW. I played it when it first came out and liked it as much as the others.
-----
Tofer: I’m actually excited as well for the game even though I have no idea how it stacks up to my favorite Zelda game
-----
Aigis: Im excited for this game, but i'm also very far from being able to get into the world of Majora's Mask
-----
Phantom Thief: I am actually quite excited for this too. I'm actually quite excited for it too. I'm actually far from being able to get into the world of Majora's Mask
-----
Funyarinpa: I'm willing to give this a chance, but I'm just not sure how. I just know it's not the best Zelda game and I really don't like it.
Bt this is not very far, but I'm still not confident enough in my own memory of it to compare it to OoT.
-----
Phantom Thief: I was hoping for a Zelda game that is more open, but that doesn't seem to be what people are looking for in Breath of the Wild.
-----
The Last One: I'm actually a bit of a fan of Majora's Mask, but I don't like it. The camera is just so so slow and unresponsive. It's disappointing, because it really does the job.

~!~Why are the 3ds's lightning buttons so cheap?

mogster7777: I havent read anything about it but the buttons feel just like the 3ds. The buttons feel just like the Vita's so cheap and I never noticed any difference. Also the smaller buttons are not very responsive. 
I remember the Vita's buttons being much more responsive. I think it is because the Vita's buttons are much larger. 
Is this just me? Does anyone have any input? Or am I missing something? It is an awful design and this isnt a mid gen refresh console.
-----
Kokonoe: Because they were made to be $80, not 60 bucks.
-----
Hieroph: They're made for phones.
-----
Oheao: I would say the Vita's buttons are responsive and I've personally tried many many times with the 3DS. The buttons are very customizable and it's just not a difficult UI. The best one for me was the 3DS's button mapping.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I'm not sure, but I had this problem too, it's not as bad as OP thinks.
-----
mogster7777: I had this problem too and it fixed it! Thank you op!
-----
Lord of Ostia: They're made for phones, it's a mobile UI issue, the verticality and the feel of the Vita are further emphasized over the other handhelds
-----
Aters: I had this problem with my Vita but the new updates fixed it. I have a 3Ds as well.
-----
hikarutilmitt: Slow response time? It was only a few seconds but the slow response delay just added an extra layer of tension that made the Vita feel more responsive.
-----
mogster7777: Yeah but (I’m a bit of a collector), I have a PS4 and a Switch and I would rather spend the money on the 3Ds and Vita games, than on the Vita games, I like the Switch one more than the Vita games and I have a feeling the Vita games will be close to Switch’s performance of the Vita games, I want more performance of the Vita games, I would love to buy the Vita versions of Persona 3,4,5 and other Atlus games such as SMT V,Persona 3, Devil Survivor Overclocked,
====================
~!~What Devs Have Done The Game To Remake The Shit That We Were Refused In In In GTA:X

Dancrane212: The final game in the Tony Hawk franchise that was previously called Bad Company 2.
I'll start by saying that Rockstar has done a ton in its first several years of existence to try and correct the atrocious gameplay and boring-but-good gameplay that was common in first-person shooters at the time.
In GTA:X, they've gone all in on the first person shooter aspect, which is what made the game up to that point and the first person perspective so interesting to me.
Everything is a "first person perspective", everything is a "first person view" thing. Everything in GTA:X just feels worse than the first person perspective.
The driving is generally flat, almost a walk to the left or right. The way it slowly shifts to cover you as you drive, the way it's constantly rolled over to cover you as you drive. The way it's a cover cover cover yell. The way it's faster than the actual speed of the car. The way it's slower than a car. The animations are awful. The "airbrakes" are busted. You can't even run in the first place.
The game is so bad, it keeps you constantly hooked on a game.
The story is...ok, but then again, GTA:X is a good game.
Take-Two told a story about all the stuff they did to try and make the player as immersed as possible with a good GTA story.
I have a pretty good idea of what to expect from it. Since GTA: San Andreas was their major inspiration, they basically redrew the story a
-----
Flux: The Home Alone games (the first two), the first few Resident Evils, the first Wing Commander, and so on.
-----
Phendrift: I think the reason why they’ve made so many tweaks is because it’s a game about law and order, not conspiracy, but the real espionage/stealth missions are the kind of missions that you’ll stop playing as a real spy by the time you hit that point.
-----
Biestmann: I love them to death, but I just can't do "baseball" in MP games. Cops shooting you from afar, grenades exploding out of your head, the host dropping

~!~[RetroERA] The best way to play Mario Party?

chronic_archaic: I've never played it, but I love to play Mario Party. It's the single most fun MP game I've ever had. I turned on my switch and was immediately taken out of the game by the slow, awful camera. I've been thinking about replaying it in some form, but I'm still in a state of disbelief that this is the best way to play a multiplayer game. The light-hearted banter and all the characters and situations just makes this game that much quintessence.
I haven't played Mario Party in years, but I remember watching every move as the party moved on, and having a blast. I think I picked the wrong stage, but it was Mario Party 2006, so I know that you can enjoy it a lot still.

~!~How do you feel about the next step in the VR evolution of gaming?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I've been thinking about this for a few days now and I can't decide between PSVR and the PS4 Pro in terms of what I think of as the best possible VR experience. I have a PSVR myself, but I've been playing games on it, and I didn't like VR much, so that lead me to thinking about what I think VR could potentially offer.
A couple things first:
1. It's not the new kid I'm talking about. The one in the room, the one in the office, and the one I've been sitting on. It's the one that's been on for the most part, but there's a lot of room for room a a lot of games on VR. Now I'm aware of the fact that the PSVR does mirror mirror VR, but I'm not sure if it's as good a VR experience as you'd expect if it's essentially the same setup and the games being made by a large team.
2. It's the one that's the most gaming comfort food. If we're talking pure gaming experiences here, the one that I definitely consider VR to be. It's not the nichest place to play or play AAA games, as the game feel like a lot of the time I'm standing in front of a TV and not standing. Also, I don't always want to stand up, so it's just not something I can sit down and stand up. But man I just want to play games.
3. It's the one that I have the most room for comfort. I don't play like a few games in a room and I don't play them to explore the experience, but I do it because I love the gaming experience. I don't want to feel like I'm playing a game I don't want to play in the comfort of my own playing field, even if it's something I'm more interested in and can play rather quickly.
So, Era, what do you think of the future of gaming?
-----
Laughing Banana: I don't think developers will make more VR games because it's easier to monetize, but I believe VR will eventually evolve beyond anything and that's great for everyone.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I feel like VR will be the new porn for it but not because it's
====================
~!~How do you feel about the Xbox Store on the Switch?

Thewonandonly: I think it’s an amazing device and it could be used by a lot of things. The OS itself is really great and it’s super quick to use.
I recently got all achievements and some of the best games I played.
I also think it’s a great deal. I’m not sure what the reasons are but it has the most games I’ve ever played across all the platforms. I’m just really curious.
-----
HeRinger: It's always been my preference on the Xbox Store. The first time I got an Xbone controller was the beginning of trying to get all the achievements on there and everything.
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I use it every time. I didn't like the idea of playing it at all.
-----
mazi: it's like a phone but more powerful. i'm pretty sure it's the best phone you can get for under $50 sometimes.
also, the first time I got an xbox controller was in the first month I tried playing it.
-----
kadotsu: I like it. I prefer a start and a fire button on the main menu.
-----
bsigg: I also use it for multiplayer on my switch, PS4 and Xbone.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: Mostly use it for multiplayer. i don't care about achievements or trophies
-----
Thewonandonly: I would for the achievement system. I just like unlocking achievements! Keeps me warm for long days haha.
-----
Derrick01: I don't like it at all but I want the option to play with friends. I wish I could just log in to the store and see what games I want to play because it's doing all of that right?
-----
KtotheRoc: I love an Xbox, but I am not fond of the Switch.

====================
~!~The best way to play Obra Dinn?

Dark_Castle: Hey Era!
I was wondering if there's any good English-speaking places to play games like Obra Dinn, and if so, what do I need to know before I spend my money.
-----
DrArchon: Unless you're also into fighting games, this is like playing a dungeon crawler.
-----
Mr-Joker: You're not getting a narrative-centric fighting game.
-----
Azoor: You are getting a fighting game.
-----
Svart: I'm assuming you don't talk to NPCs?
-----
Dark_Castle: I saw that on reddit, and it's not exactly what I was expecting. 
I'm not very familiar with the language used to make the English-language marketplaces, but I'm thinking that maybe you could help out on this?
-----
Svart: How do you get your money?
-----
Dust: You don't get a narrative/cutscene-centric fighting game.
It's like asking if you like fighting games.
-----
Usyren: I'm more of a VN type person... I like fighters but I don't want to play a fighting game. A game is like a drug, it's like a drug. 
There's a demo on the Eshop if you're interested, but for now I'll try the demo of Rival Schools School for Switch.

~!~Prototype Game Labs (Indivisuous) announce My Memory of Liberty, a spiritual successor to the classic Starman series

Deleted member 1258: I've been waiting for a good spiritual successor to Starman, and I've been wondering what others think about it. 
It looks like a cool little series.
-----
RionaaM: I'm watching this later. Is it bad that there's no My Memory of Liberty (like a typical Starman game), or that it's pretty much a parody of Starman in its gameplay mechanics? I'm thinking of something different with this game.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I don't know! I remember reading an interview with David Jaffe years ago that said it was decent at best, but I'm not sure what the case is here.
-----

====================
~!~Which game is the best in your opinion?

Aswitch: While I didn't play Bayonetta 1 & 2, I really didn't think I'd get to play Asuna if I had to choose one. I've played so many games get 3 or 4. I've played the first FFXIV and then played the second one. I've played through the first FFXIV.
My answer is a simple game can reign supreme in every decision. The story, characters, dungeons, world, characters, world pacing and pacing are all great. However, you've got to think about which game is and is not your favorite.
-----
Aigis: I've been a gamer, I'd say it's gotta be Bayonetta. I don't really like Bayonetta because she is hugely overrated and I'm not a very good person to look up to. I really like the stylized art style and the artstyle and colour palette and the music is absolutely great. Also the characters in this game are all really well done.
-----
Frump: I think it's Splatoon.
I like a lot of the characters in this game but I dislike the gameplay and the gameplay is generally bad. The DLC characters are great and they were great in Splatoon.
-----
TheCreationTS: I can only think of 2 games in my opinion and that is BlazBlue Central Fiction.
I can also think of Bayonetta 1, BlazBlue Central Fiction and for some reason I like all 3 quite a bit.
-----
Phantom Thief: I can’t really think of games that I think are the best in their respective series, but I like my pick
-----
Crayon: I haven't played many of these yet. I guess I never knew that.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I’m gonna say Devil Survivor.
-----
duckroll: This is a tough argument to make for people if you want to make a thread in complete seriousness.
BUT: I think Devil Survivor.
-----
Crayon: I don't really agree with much. I think it's at odd to have a thread like this.
-----
Strangelove77: I know what you mean. I really disliked Bayonetta 2.

====================
~!~Why are Japanese games not fighting game at 4k?

asmith906: I'd like to see an option to upscale the game to 4k. Why is it?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It's in devision's guidelines
-----
Joltik: It's probably not for competitive purposes, but I would be surprised if it was not for the lack of skill involved.
-----
emag: 4K is still not affordable in the US.
-----
Aigis: I think its because these days everyone is hungry for more people to play jrpgs again..
-----
Noppie: I think it's for those who prefer 1080p TV's and higher framerates for higher resolution/performance.
-----
XDevil666: Because jrpgs are still expensive to make 
also 4k is a complicated process that requires both the tech and time to follow
-----
Aigis: Since nier is a game that people want to play, and nier is a game that has a huge fanbase for it, it isnt that hard to not do something to make it more popular.
-----
JayBee: I mean you could take an even simpler process like render into a higher resolution and get a higher framerate and still make a great game

sinonobu: Looks like it will be ported to PS4 and XB1.
edit:
Forgot to mention that the version on Switch includes a free trial of the game.

Vena: I'm actually pretty hyped for this. Hope it's good, but if it's at launch I'll have to double dip since it's a bit disappointing.
EDIT: Oh yeah, it's the PS4 version!

Xumbrega: Day one
-----
sinonobu: Err,

V-Faction: Did I miss the news?

HeRinger: Nice! I'll definitely double dip. I only care about the art style.

Richter1887: So this is the same team that made the original for OG Xbox.
The whole team is there.

Chalphy: Not much to write home about this version compared to the PS4 version, but yes, I'll be double dipping.

Xumbrega: I am excited for this.

~!~Sphinx and The Curse of the Moon: A sci-fi 4 player dungeon crawler from the devs of The Sinking City.

CenturionNami: It's out on Steam. A lot of interest in this, I'll have it on my radar!

Razor Mom: Hyped!
-----
TheMoon: one of my fav indie games this year
-----
DriftingSpirit: Is that a Ph.D. of Sci-fi?
-----
CenturionNami: It's a Ph.D. of Sci-fi.
-----
Kenzodielocke: You are looking for a good sci-fi game in Germany.
-----
WonderLuigi: no
-----
Hexa: I saw this recently and it's pretty good. I'm not sure if it's worth a gamble but I'm interested in it. Maybe it's a mix of the Silent Hill series and something that a bit more realistic.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: Looks interesting, but as a horror game, it's not really of my comfort zone. I don't usually play horror games but this sounds like it could provide that feeling of isolation. I'm interested though, maybe it'll be good?
-----

====================
~!~Can we talk about how insanely good the Forza Motorsport series was?

Theorry: First of all let me say i love Forza Motorsport and Team whilst it was fun its was mostly bad. Its one of the best racing series out there imo. Imo its a shame what went wrong with the last entry was quite a step down in visuals.
But i love the Motorsport series. The last one was ok but definitely didnt received the love its deserves.
So after the recent events of Forza 6 producer, game director and series producer Matthew Hayden stated that the team did not develop for speed based games. He also stated that they didn't want to make racing sim games and made it very clear that the lack of pfv type racers was a huge cause for the problems with Motorsport. He also mentioned that the next entry will be based on a open world game rather than open world.
The reason i say this is because the next entry is going to be basically a return to form with new cars and tracks but with a more futuristic feel to it.
The only problem i have with the racing series is that the lack of pfv type racers was also a problem in the last entry.
Now i know how hard it could be to introduce a Forza game here but there was also nothing wrong with the way they were to react to the past issues with the Motorsport series. They seemed to change their tune quite a bit.
Now with Forza 7 getting released on the platform which was killed for speed by the original team and now the team had to work on a new racing game and it was not a open world one. They also decided to focus more on PGR than GT.
Now that the team has to work on a new racing game and is confident in it, they should probably go for a new racing game.
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: I think it was a bit too much Turn10.
-----
GangWarily: I'm not sure if it's a good or bad thing. I understand why they got rid of Forza way too early in the generation, especially with ForzaMotorsport's resurgence on consoles. I guess the 'open' feeling wasn't as strong as it would have been if the series wasn't dead on arrival but I think that's a different problem.
-----
LonestarZues: I agree. I hope they go back to

~!~Is the battery life about 15% longer than a 3DS?

Parshias: I guess my issue with the battery life of the Switch is that the price of such a device (even when packed in an SD card) is welling the way for such a long battery life upgrade.
Considering the Switch is already pretty lengthy it would seem like a good time to get some other 3DS-style handhelds. Suggestions for such recommendations?
-----
Azajabar: I have a 3DS XL
-----
Nuclear Muffin: It’s not just about storage, it’s about battery life!
It’s such a significant difference that you can’t discern anywhere else what should be doing.
It’s no longer just about cramming a 3DS in a bag and playing with the tray; it’s more about the battery life.
-----
Neoxon: I don’t know if this is an accurate statement, but I’ve seen multiple threads on multiple different systems over the past week, with various 3DS screens. It’s especially egregious when it’s a refurbished one.
-----
Razlo: I have a regular 2DS and it holds about 60 hours. Both my wife and I use one.
-----
Heartskips: Yes, the 3DS XL is great.
-----
Parshias: I think the dock is a little underpowered compared to the regular 2DS and I feel like this is something that can easily be fixed by the time the holidays are over... I also feel like the battery life is better left undocked too.
-----
mrchaos: I have a regular New 2DS and it holds about 30 hours without power down. It’s also my only real complaint with the current surge charging tech. It’s the best way to charge the system. There’s a few other docks you can buy, but none of them charge like this.
-----
Neoxon: The dock is literally more powerful than a New 2DSXL, honestly.

~!~I think I need to play the original Kingdom Hearts

Strangelove77: I’m trying to get into Kingdom Hearts. I’ve played through 1 and 2, 1.5 + 2.5 and Chain of Memories. I’ve also tried playing 0.2 and Birth by Sleep. I’ve also played through 1.5, 0.2, and BBS but those games are terrible. I think I need to play the PS1 version. I’ve heard it’s bad ass. Is the emulation quality bad? How is the story?
-----

Hercule: PS1 version is bad.
I don't think it's bad at all. The PS1 version is supposed to be bad even more.
-----
ASaiyan: It's a pretty great game.
It's worth a shot, but I think it's worth skipping.
-----
Strangelove77: I think I need to play them now.
-----
The Last Wizard: I’m sorry but you’re not wrong.
-----
Strangelove77: That’s for me.
-----
ASaiyan: Yeah. I think OP is right. I haven't gone through all the games in the series yet.
-----
Strangelove77: How do you know?
-----
Hailinel: If you're gonna try to play KH1.5 and 0.2, you should check out the PS1 version. It's a pretty solid game.

~!~I Think Nintendo Should Buy Campo Santo

MrMatt555: Sucker Punch had a podcast recently called "Farewell Mr. Campo" where they talk about their company, and I thought they should do a podcast about their company.

-----
Sargerus: Oh my!
-----
Tribal24: Gonna be a long wait for this podcast but this is amazing.
-----
MrMatt555: I thought that was old
-----
Asbsand: I do wonder what their strategy is going to be. I mean, I could be excited for this podcast but I don't think it's the kind of thing that would get enough attention.
-----
The Adder: The IGN podcast was hilarious when it came out, and it's even better.

====================
~!~So, how's Dark Souls Remastered compare to the PS4 version?

Flux: So I've been thinking about the game for a week now and I've finally decided to play it. I'm wondering if I should hold off on buying it or if I should just wait for a better version to arrive.
I have the game on Steam and the price given is about the same as the PS4 version.
It's my first Souls game so I'm not expecting much replayability, but I'd like to get a bit of a challenge out of it if I end up doing something like this - I wanna stay out of skeletons and in the wild.
Is the Remastered content worth playing? Is it still worth playing?
-----
BouncyFrag: I’d say go for it. It’s a good game and a good mode. Its combat system is just as deep as any other souls game.
-----
JustJavi: Just play it. Play it with the new DLC coming out next month.
-----
LonestarZues: I'd say the best part of the game is backtracking through the areas with the souls games and collecting the weapons. Go through the areas using them directly. I'd still recommend it to play it with DLC.
-----
SofNascimento: You can find them in the "quest" board in the Undead section. It's a good idea to bring along the DLC as well.
-----
Ahasverus: The game is amazing and you'll never even notice until the end of the game.
The DLC is a lot of fun. The Demons' Souls-esque DLC is totally worth playing.
-----
GymWolf86: I really need to finish this game because its just so boring.
-----
Frox: The DLC is the Dark Souls games.
-----
TheBaldwin: Theres some great DLC. 
Uncharted 4, just play it.
-----
TheBaldwin: The souls series, to me its a better paced game with alot more wide exploration and more souls combat, I dont remember alot of the dlcs in the soul games.

Svart:

Psychoward: You can play games and play games if you want, why not play games?
-----
Platy: The thing that has me the most excited is that if you like smash you'll be able to play it for free.
I also really like being in communities that give you something to do and discuss.
I also like it when people can come and play and play and it doesn't matter what they are playing or doing, it didn't matter when they first start playing, it's all about the first to play.
Like water is wet when you pick up a game and it starts pouring.
-----
Jayson's Rage: Yeah. I'm for this, and I've been for a while.
-----
SOLDIER: This is so much fun, and so easily why I never even thought about it but it seems to be a popular feature of it.
-----
Kyoufu: That's my feeling.

Grapezard: I'd say this is a feature that every person should try.

~!~Riot Games, the forgotten developer from the creation of League of Legends, launched a crowdfunding campaign

Saucycarpdog: The campaign for Riot Games' upcoming open world game ''League of Legends'' is finally over. 
The campaign name is a new statement about Riot's relationship with Riot Games. It was made during the League of Legends community stream.
Also, here's the teaser for the game.

benzopil: The first thing I thought of when I saw this

====================
~!~Sekiro Shadows Die Twice's combat system is one of the best in the industry

Memento: Reminder, this is a game that got a T, and got a B. I (and I mean a B-)
Combat system is fun (beatable with a guide), but I don't think it's even close to combat game of the year of the Soulsborne games. The combat system is absolutely amazing, and absolutely fresh for an action adventure game.
It's a shame that the game doesn't have a proper end-game. It should've been a million-dollar title, and it seems that the game has lost that.
-----
Mikey Jr.: I like combat.
Well, guess I'll start Ninja Gaiden.
-----
Ahasverus: Pretty good, even if it's not Dragon's Dogma level.
-----
Seda: No. Yea, Souls combat is pretty damn good.
-----
Claven: I don't think it's close, but I enjoyed the combat in Dark Souls 1 more than Bloodborne, so I'll give it a try.
-----
TheYanger: It's a good game, but not nearly as good as the soulsborne games. I'd say it's a super solid game, though, and I'd recommend it if you have some friends to play.
-----
Dee Bill: I'll give it a go next time I play it.
-----
Ferrs: It's better than most souls games imo.
-----
Tambini: I haven't played it but I think it's a 3rd person action game.
Don't expect the same level of input response and input management as souls.
-----
Pillock: My GOTY!

====================
~!~What if Nintendo made a Smash game with the Octoling as the main character?

Uzumaki Goku: The Octoling is not the main character. Instead, the Octoling is a nunchuck who can smash you in the face. It's a fighting game, right?
-----
Lant_War: They should make Smash Ultimate with this character and all the characters from the 3DS and Wii U games.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I would like that.
-----
KZXcellent: I think they should do a Pokémon-Like with the Octoling
-----
Cartridge Games: Smash is the Nintendo way of seeing characters in Smash Bros games.
Pokémon is probably the most likely candidate since Pokémon is the most popular video game region
-----
KZXcellent: The Octoling will always be the main character.
-----
zKinx: I want the Pokemon characters in Smash.
-----

Neptonic: The fighter could be based on Lucario if they want to keep it as a new fighter
-----
JusDoIt: It'd be cool if Sakurai goes wild with the Octo Expansion.

====================
~!~What is your favorite song from the Trails of Cold Steel games?

SolVanderlyn: I mean, I kinda liked it, but it doesn't matter.
-----

sredgrin: A couple of my favorites:
-----

Scotia: All time favorite. Cold Steel is awesome so I'm gonna have to play and listen to it.
-----
Strings: I remember liking a bunch of it back in the day, but I generally just ignored the rest of the series.
-----
HououinKyouma00: I gotta give it to Trails of Cold Steel.
The orchestrated soundtrack of the first two games perfectly sums up the feeling of playing the first game and then playing SC for the first time. I ended up really liking it.
-----
Cantaim: I love the opening of the first game dearly but the ending song is still stuck in my head. I only played the first game once.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: i love this game so much that i got the platinum, it's so damn emotional, btw, it's a very different game than the other games, and also the ending is so very sad, even more so than before, but it's also so nice, the emotional part still gets to me!

bsigg: I'm unsure if I want to use controller on console or not, had no idea about that.
-----
Bear: Xbox One Enhanced? I need to know.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Yes, and there is a mod that lets you use the controller on Xbox too.
I think I've tried using the controller on PC before, but the connection was kinda shaky during gameplay and I would have to hook it up to the PC each time to make it work.

~!~News About The Unseen Ad for the PlayStation Meeting [Update: Sony announces that they have finished fixing the issue]

Pingal Pratyush: Update on Sony's plans for the upcoming PlayStation Meeting:
Original post:

Update:
Original post:
Just a heads up for those who don't mind some spoilers coming up.
Source
It's been a while since the last PlayStation Meeting. The news about a Sony summit in March of this year had already gone live. But, that was the last update today.
Update 2:
Original post:
So, this post has been on the PlayStation blog for a long time. It was just a search for something else to post.
However, here is the latest update detailing the Sony Meeting's schedule:
They have in-depth talks with Yay Barajitsi and other members of Sony about the unannounced announcement of the PlayStation Meeting. They also discuss the business side of things and how things are going moving forward.
They are also happy to answer any questions about the next generation.
They hope to have things flying when they last update in January.
As for the update itself, they have started a process of "rebranding" the brand, which is done internally, they hope to end the process with the end of the service on March 2020.

~!~So... do we know anything about Resident Evil 2 Remake?

Crazy Izanagi: So... I’m playing RE2 in preparation for RE2 Remake and I’m wondering... does the game have a story? If yes do we need to play as the zombies?
What do we need to know about the survival horror survival horror survival horror survival horror experience Resident Evil 2 Remake contains?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: No story is enough
-----
TheBaldwin: I wouldnt be surprised if we dont really know anything, but I would be surprised if we dont fully understand what the game is
-----
Cinemikel: I do not
-----
Rikucrafter: I wouldnt say no to a story, but I feel like the SP story would be spread throughout the game. It would be cool to start out with some vague set characters from Raccoon City and then make some connections. 
My guess is the zombies are from the past and the bad guy has possessed them. There is a slight tension between them as they grow older (The game seems to have a lot of flashbacks from Raccoon City in terms of how some of the past's have affected them), but it wasnt as strong in the SP game.
-----
A.By: I wouldnt be surprised if we don't have a story at all.
-----
TheMoon: We know nothing about the game.
-----
Cisce: I'm pretty sure that we don't even know anything about the story.
-----
TheMoon: We don't even know what the story is. It's all we've ever know.

~!~What’s your favorite soundtrack from the Castlevania series?

Phediuk: Pollolund is a series that I haven’t heard much of, and the soundtrack is honestly a drag.
-----
mopinks: the entire soundtrack of lords of shadow
-----
SalvaPot: Symphony of the Night.
-----
harz-marz: The GOAT.
-----
Opa-Pa: Always loved the soundtrack from Harmony of Despair and Lords of Shadow. The rest of the Lords of Shadows are probably my least favourite of the lot, but I really like the music in Rondo's OST.
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: For all the praise it gets I find it hard to get over the soundtrack of LoZ: Bloodlines. It's just a masterpiece. 
I also love the music from Lords of Shadows, but the actual music for it seems a bit more varied then the first game's music.
-----
Lichtsang: I like the soundtrack of Lords of Shadows better than I do the game.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I can't wait for the Castlevania 3 soundtrack when I get to playing it soon.
-----
ReyVGM: I prefer the Castlevania 3 soundtrack.
-----
Opa-Pa: Yeah, that's right. I feel like there's more diversity in video game music than I ever realized with the medium growing in internet culture and the rise of more widespread artistes.
I don't think I've ever had so many great OSTs in a series. They're all pretty varied and original, and I love that.

~!~Sony’s Neil Druckman: "No Man’s Sky is a passable game, but I still think it’s worth buying"

Nightengale: I thought this was worth posting, because, as I noted in the previous thread, it seems like it has recourses that you need to clear to get to the story of the game. I don't know if this was always the case, but I always heard it has.
I was fully immersed in The Last Guardian, when I first heard about the game. It was no surprise that I was fascinated and I felt that the game was in desperate need of some action. The game itself is a very good action game, but it was so satisfying to move from placing a finger on the trigger to walking through a chain chasm to moving through a door. The game was always interesting to me, despite the lack of a gameplay hook.
I was also surprised when the game had a re-release on Xbox One in the fall of 2014, and I was quite blown away when it came out for Xbox One. I was excited at the prospect of replaying the game again, and it seemed to have fallen through the cracks.
So yeah, I think it's worth buying it now, for what it is.
-----
Cess007: I loved the first game, and have hope for the sequel.
-----
Bits N Pieces: I agree. It's one of the best horror games out there.
-----
NarohDethan: I bought it and played a bit of it, but when it first popped in my PS4, I was absolutely shocked at how good it looked, and the music was very high on my priority list to just play. I loved the first game and the sequel is amazing, and I hope they make a sequel as good as this.
-----
Gbraga: I've been meaning to replay it for a while. I love the world and the characters, but I just don't see myself going back to it. I remember really enjoying the combat and general gameplay loop, and the story feels like it was written by a 4 year old.
-----
Starset: The game is very good and has a potential to be very good. I hope they go back to it
-----
Cess007: True. It's essential in a horror game.
-----
Imp the Dimp: I loved

-----
Toumari: $19.99 a piece for UK people.

CloseTalker: I'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to go. I'm not really interested in the Crash brand, but if it's $30 or less, I might bite.

~!~What are the best crossover costumes in fighting games?

"D.": A crossover costume is a character that has a design or appearance that is closely tied to a game that that designates a different character for that character's appearance.
For me...I am of the opinion that an obvious one-two cheeseburger pizza outfit is the best.
What are your guys opinion on this pick?
-----

SENPAIatLARGE: Valkyria Chronicles has the best game story
-----
Platy: Because it is the main character
-----

"D.": Yeah, but those are optional costumes
-----

Lant_War: Lol, I really didn't like the one liners in SFV's story mode.
-----
Pancracio17: Smash 4
-----
BubbleButt64: I don't think the DKC costumes in 3D Fighting games are optional.
-----
Brock Reiher: the least important thing in the game are the beanie costumes

====================
~!~Why do multiplayer games always have to have a battle royale mode?

Tahnit: Basically no ragequitters here. I’d rather have the game power up if I’m engaging in a game. I’d rather have people be the premiers if I’m just playing for fun. 
Anyways, I’m just curious how does this happen. I feel like I’m the premiers now because I’m engaging in a game.
-----
Aters: It's because games are designed with the people in mind in mind. The reason why there are premiers in multiplayer is because the people in the game can be in any one mind.
-----
LossAversion: It's because games are designed to engage players in multiplayer games. They're not design that players who get in with the game can turn into arguing over a playground.
-----
Unicorn: I'm not sure why you think we're supposed to be in a BR thread when there are premiers for every mode in every game.
-----
Tahnit: I mean I usually just default to picking PVP teams.
-----
Duxxy3: I don't have any friends that play MP games. I usually try to find a team that have a good amount of people. I'm all about weapons and vehicles in PvE games.
-----
Aters: I'm in the head or I don't enter into it.
-----
Hjod: I'm in the head, I usually pick PVP teams.
-----
Unicorn: I don't play competitive games, so I can't speak for multiplayer. 
But I have some friends who do, they actually enjoy PvE games and think that this is the best way to play. 
I'm in it because games are designed by mens.
-----
Aters: Would it not be more confusing if there's a premade group of people in a shared game room than it would be in a game?

~!~Is it true that games are now cheap to develop?

ToddBonzalez: It's a sentiment that games are now cheaper to develop, and we'll likely see more games being developed as we expect to see a lot of third party games developed in the next couple of years. For example, developing an AAA game this year without needing to spend an inordinate amount of time testing studios, is a far more lucrative project.
I personally think it's more likely that developers are starting to look to smaller scale projects like this and Nintendo for additional development budget to go along with the development cost of developing games.
-----
Spring-Loaded: I think so, and I think it's good that more people have interest in games growing larger and larger over time, but I don't think it's a new development budget being higher than what they were in the mid-90s. In many ways, the current paradigm is that companies just simply hire more people to make things in a more specialized area and have no issues going beyond that. 
Also, I think it's a little unfair that we're seeing cheaper development of AAA games. It's just not a priority for developers.
-----
shaneo632: Not really. Almost all first-party AAA games are at least 1.5 gig budgets now, from Nintendo to start of thing.
-----
Error 52: I think it's actually become more common in recent years. In the last generation, the biggest games developed were relatively single-player games, but the number of games in that range ballooned. In the last generation, it has more than ever been, and even in the last generation, it's more than twice as likely as now to be developed.
-----
nsilvias: nope. most of the money now goes to studios, not high end game studios that mainly care about their gameplay mechanics or sales.
-----
EmSetERO: Nope, I don’t think so. But now, the most powerful people in the industry are starting to act like this is a good idea and get the money out of the developing company. I think it will be a better idea for the industry than ever to treat the growing number of studios as a test, not a highway.
-----
Elyian: Nope. I think it's more of a changing of the game culture thing. More people starting working on games instead of developing them and seeing them
====================
~!~I want a new Rayman game

BubbleButt64: I've been playing a lot of Rayman games lately and I'm really enjoying the new Rayman games. The first game was pretty fun but it had a lot of jank and overall it was a bit of a slog. I guess I should return to it someday.
However, I feel like playing a new Rayman game is the best start. The first game is one of the best realized 3d levels ever and it's a shame that it wasn't more polished. 
The 2 sequels that I prefer to play the best are 1 and 3. They're both action games with a heavy emphasis on platforming and I adore platformers. The platform sections are where they both excel. They're platforming though, I suppose. I love platformers, but 1 is alright too. I did enjoy the platforming though.
I was thinking about playing 4 but I don't know if I want to pull the 4 and start over because that's kind of emo as well.
Anyway, what are your thoughts on the game?
-----
DarkConfidant: I think that the first two games are fine, and probably better than the 3 sequels. The platforming in the first one is way better, and the platform sections are good. 
But.. I also don’t know how you can play Rayman 2 and 4 the same. It’s just too similar. It’s not a good game.
-----
TheMoon: The only thing you have to consider is the levels (not really), how the hell they end and how they morph between modern and Classic. It's all kind of nebulous, weird, and "video game" that I'm sure these guys don't know about.
-----
Phantom Thief: The magic in 2 and 3 is clear, and it’s the reason I played it first, but 1 is so different from the others. It’s a video game.
-----
Falchion: I loved the platforming sections in 1 and I preferred the platforming in 2 and 3. I never got all that into the 3 sequels though.
-----
banter: Rayman 2 is the best Rayman game and deserves a proper sequel. The first one is still my favourite of the bunch and I'd recommend playing it as well. The 3 remasters are also

~!~The Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Sky

Synohan: FINALLY, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of the Sky is releasing soon!
I'm very excited for this game. I've had it in my wish list for a while now and I'm a big fan of the Trails series. I noticed the trailer at the end and I jumped in. I'll let you know if you get it on release date.
-----
Grapezard: I'm so looking forward to this. One of the best non-TGS games.

Synohan: No problem, I've been waiting!
Never heard of this game before but it looks really good, is it not free to play?

~!~What do you want out of the next Resident Evil?

SofNascimento: RE7 is one of my favorite games of all time and I can't wait for next year. But, the question of what the current iteration of Resident Evil will is always something I have a lot of fun with. So, what are things you want out of the next RE?
-----
TheMoon: I don't see what it's about the ones I do already.
-----
Strafer: I want a girl in a white lab who doesn't know what a " RE " is.
I want a T-girl in a white lab.
-----
Darkwing-Buck: I want a new RE game from Remake2.
-----
Bundy: A new RE game from someone who made the game he loves.
-----
dharmapolice: A remake of RE1.
-----
Pancracio17: A RE game set in the RE1 era.
-----
Dr. Caroll: A remake of the original trilogy, on the same engine as RE2.
-----
SofNascimento: Hmmm, I think I'm finally getting round to playing RE2. I generally hate the games but the atmosphere and locations have tons of potential, and I can't wait to see how it's shaping up.
-----
Travaughn: I want a remake of 1-4 in the style of what Capcom is doing with RE2make.

~!~What's the best way to play the original Ridge Racer?

Waluigilicious: I've been thinking about this and it's kind of meh.
Ridge Racer Type 4 was a racer that was never really thought of. It was a "classic". It was a "vanilla" game. It was more arcade racing sim and was available on a more powerful console.
I remember thinking for a while about how awesome it would be to play it on a console with a "definitive edition". I mean it would be the same shit but with an actual disc.
Well I was thinking, well maybe you could try that?
I mean it would be the same as a regular racing game but with the disc. I mean it would be a modernized version of the original Ridge Racer.
I mean it would be a decent, not amazing, but I wouldn't mind getting it.
This is the best way to play the original.
I remember thinking for a second that this game was the best that RR was and we've never received the DLCs for it.
-----
Platy: An arcade version of RR4 would be like a 20th anniversary edition of RR2
-----
Waluigilicious: This is what I've been thinking as well.
Well I mean it would be the same as a regular racing game and it would be even better with a disc.
I would have thought that would have been the best of the best but it's not the best.
But if I was you I would not think the best of the best
-----
Derachi: I would play the real deal.
I would buy it if it worked as intended.
-----
Waluigilicious: I mean I've bought the game for 60 bucks and I have no regrets. I'd even pay what I paid for it to get the DLC.
-----
Chittagong: I would buy it on Xbox if I still had the disc.
-----
Ratchetdude231: I have no regret. I bought it on PS4 on release day and I have no regrets.
-----
Vivi: I would play it again if I could just get my save file from the PC version.
-----
Waluigilicious: Are you talking about the Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy that came out in 2012?
-----
MouldyK: I would

~!~What are the best Mario Kart/Smash/Donkey Kong levels?

TheDinoman: I know that Super Circuit is kind of a standout, but I'm looking for some other quality levels or Adventure Maps, or even something akin to those famous Mario and Sonic levels.
Personally I like treasure maps from just about the SMW, Yoshi, and DKC. There's a lot of detail to them.
What about you?
-----
ReyVGM: If you want Mario Kart, you can't go wrong with the original Hardcorps Island.
-----
Zalman: Edit: I forgot to add a poll.
-----
TheDinoman: I'm not sure if Hardcorps is exactly the best?
-----
Kamiyouni: I love these levels.
I'm not sure if they are particularly good or bad but I like them quite a lot in my personal opinion.
-----
TheDinoman: I think a good one is the Chain Chomp Challenge. I love it a lot.
-----
TheDinoman: Ah, sorry about that.
-----
Mr-Joker: I still really like the Zelda one.
-----
TheDinoman: Ahh, sorry for getting it wrong.
-----
TheDinverse: Both of these I thought was pretty fair. Just wish they were harder and with more variety. Zelda is definitely a harder proposition without the platforming and more difficult with the level layouts.

====================
~!~I'm getting into the "no action no buy" genre

Arulan: After playing the quite good Yakuza games recently, I'm finding it difficult to figure out how to get into the "no action no buy" genre. I understand that there are tons of action games and visual novels this year that could be considered "action games", but I'm confused about how to play them.
I'm trying to figure out what to play in order to maximize my enjoyment of these games. I'm playing the following:
- Yakuza series
- Ni No Kuni 2
- Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Remastered
- Ni No Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom
- Shining Resonance
- Dragon Quest 11
- Hitman 2
- Dragon Quest Builders
- Yakuza Kiwami 2
- Gravity Rush Remastered
- Everybody's Golf
- Viewtiful Joe
I'm kind of stuck and trying to get better at the games as I play them, but I'm also trying to figure things out for myself. Is there a good entry point for this type of game? Is there a good price point?
I'm also trying to figure out how to get the most enjoyment out of JRPGs, but I don't really care for most of the genre. I don't want to play games that I'm just getting bored away with.
-----
Clix: I think you should play Cosmic Star Heroine. It’s a very good entry in the backseat shooter/shooter and has a good amount of challenge.
-----
Kylo Reysoee: Xenoblade.
Its a really good and charming game, with a really good story and characters. If you have any interest in anime, its worth a look.
-----
Schmitz: Xenoblade series. 
Mostly just pick your favourite story and main character and you'll be good.
-----
Out_Of_Ammo: Xenoblade 2: Torna - The Golden Country is amazing and a special experience.
-----
Alethiometer: The Yakuza series. Play them as you want, they don't have to offer the action type of the series.
-----
CielTynave: I used to think like this, but I've recently come to realize, at least in the first few months, that maybe I'm missing out on some great games.
====================
~!~All three main PlayStation franchises in Battle Royale mode.

KrigareN-: The most fun part of the game. Just like in other Battle Royale games you’ll have to get the majority of kills in each of the zones.
-----
KZXcellent: I honestly don't see how that's viable since the only objective is avoiding the crap out of the enemies.
-----
sambills: I think it will be good, but not great
-----
Aokiji: It’ll be a fav. theme in all games
-----
GarthLordOfTheSith: Nah. Unless the next one is really really good like Battle Royale at least.
-----
Hieroph: I see no reason for this not to be the default.
-----
kennyamr: I'd rather have a single player campaign than another random multiplayer mode.
-----
Heartskips: It would be cool, but I don't think it would be very fun.
-----
Sargerus: I wouldn't mind it.

====================
~!~What do you like about GameStop(and other retailers)?

butman: I just got a used copy of Metal Slug 3DS from a GameStop. It is a great game and it is the one I need to buy when I have the space open for a big discount.
However, I am not a game man, so I go to other stores, to find the best price.
But when I go to a game store, all I see is a lot of people complaining about how the prices are not good.
I don't know what to tell you, but these people are mostly high profile, and I have seen some posts here and there.
So what do you think?
-----
Abriael: I usually get the best deals, but it's very common for them to only let me order a game from a listing I like (e.g. Snake Eater) or the entire store will be gone in 5 minutes.
-----
Aprikurt: There's always the Gamer's Club Unlocked. I ordered Persona 5 from a Gamestop because I wanted to get the true ending without having to spend money.
-----
Manu: When I go to a store to buy something, I try to get the best price. 
And if it doesn't work, I tend to ignore it.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I tend to prefer the stores I order them from and own them within the last five years.
-----
Piscus: Some places will let you pick your price based on that website listing. Other places won't give you the right information.
-----
Daffy Duck: They give you the best deals.
-----
TrickyAssist: It's usually the better stores because of the expiration date. They will have something in store for you if you order online.
-----
Puffy: They're usually better than the average mom and pop stores
-----
Zonar: Generally I order from amazon, usually order from amazon mother and it's not even a question of best shipping.

====================
~!~Been playing RE2 and was wondering what kind of a horror game this would be.

BAD: I don’t mean to sound like I’d be able to provide a spoiler tag, but I think this is the kind of psychological horror that the RE series is and I’ve been hearing mixed things about it.
It’s a survival horror game in which you have to take care of the immediate situation and when a certain person starts to die you have to choose to revive them or not. The primary difference being this is much more dangerous than a survival game.
The protagonist, Claire runs away from the zombies and stops the enemies coming back. She sees a lot of bodies and is running back towards all the weapons and could potentially shoot them if bullets touched her.
She aims a pistol and shoots a bunch of the enemies. The player can then choose to not kill her, or to not kill the zombie and she lets it go.
Spoiler
By doing this you’ll save the zombies and the survivors, who are more likely to run away from the enemies and chase you back.
-----
Darkwing-Buck: I liked the first half of the game for the first time. It felt very scary.
-----
HMS_Pinafore: Yes, this is my favorite RE game and I think the first half is great (for a horror game).
Also, the first half is a lot more atmospheric and creepy than the second. I never got the sense that all the enemies were just zombies or just people smacked in the face etc.
-----
Punished Dan: I can’t wait to play this.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: It's the best RE game, RE2 is a classic.
-----
Dukie85: I think the game is a masterpiece.
-----
Tokyo_Funk: I thought it was a pretty good horror game, but I was just surprised when I saw it in Japan.
-----
Darkwing-Buck: It's a great game dude.
-----
Scotia: I think it's the best survival horror game of this generation by a landslide.
-----
Adamska: I liked it, but I wish I'd played it before RE7. Maybe I'm just used to horror, and the original RE was great, but I don't know if I'd play

~!~The Verge - The Jimquisition - The biggest reason I will NEVER play videogames

Schlorgan: 
-----
bananafactory: It's a video game. The internet instead of the game world should have these websites write you an article or send you a letter stating how you're a perma- death and that you are going to play videogames.
Spoiler
-----
Lashley: I feel like the video game side of things should be taken seriously
-----
Cess007: I agree with him. It's not like the internet at all.
-----
DerpZzF: I have a need to break it up though, if I really liked video games.
I like to know what I like and what I don't like and I have no problem changing, that's all I'm asking
-----
Kuro: It's a video game.
-----
Masterspeed: It's not the internet.
-----
PMS341: It's a video game, I don't think it matters at all. 
The point of these websites is to avoid being called Opinion sites by people who are against them. Just because something looks "outdated" on a store level doesn't mean other pieces of media, individuals, or orgs should be called Opinion STDs.
-----
Renna Hazel: I'm actually thinking about going to grad school for psychology this year. I have a feeling I'll be doing something about opinion much the more oxygen I seem to get in the room.

====================
~!~Let's talk about the best "Zelda clones"

Anono: Ok, so I've got to finish Breath of the Wild.
I had planned to but I forgot to to tell you before I'd dive in.
Breath of the Wild is, essentially, an evolution of Zelda. The core of the game is, for better or worse, Zelda-like elements.
The main gimmick is the climbing system, which is pretty universal to the game. You can freely use all the various skills in the game to climb cliffs, though climbing is not as limited as you would in other games. Climbing allows you to explore various Divine Beasts (love that one screenshot), which contain quite a number of shrines.
The shrines change with the Divine Beasts you carry. When you switch weapons, like in the first game, you can pick up shrines from the Divine Beast list. The Divine Beast list is what you generally see when playing the game, and it shows what Divine Allocations you have equipped, how many Divine Beasts you have obtained (i.e. The Divine Requirements for obtaining the Divine Requirements are exactly the same as in OOT), and how many Divine Allocations you have yet to obtain.
The shrines change with the Divine Beasts you carry. When you switch weapons, like in the first game, you can use shrines from the Divine Allocations you have purchased. The Divine Allocations you have obtained in the last game change with the Divine Beasts you carry in the world.
So, the Divine Allocations you have acquired in the last game are what you'll need to progress through the game, and the Divine Allocations you have obtained in the last game are what you'll need to complete the game.
So, I've got to wrap my thought out parties. What are your thoughts on these three clones of Zelda, and why?
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I don't know if it's the kind of thing I like to hear a discussion on, but I think the answer is Turok in Smash.
-----
TheCthultist: I have to agree with The Almighty A.I. Begging for some joke fuel to get me to play M&L still makes me a shitfire of possibly losing a few hours of my life to one of the greater evils on the Switch.

Yaboosh: No lies detected.

~!~Twin Mirror (Vita) delayed to Summer 2018

Jonneh: I just found this article on the Steam store page, which explains the delay.
From the announcement trailer page:
-----
Porygon: I was hoping for summer, but they really should have delayed it to the end of the year.
-----
Toumari: I thought it was in development for a while now?
-----
Shao Kahn: Just a temporary delay, I think.
-----
Hasemo: I would have expected first year summer, which is a bit of a missed opportunity.
-----
Slayven: I didn't notice, I'll just wait for the summer sale
-----
FaintDeftone: Ahh, I think I'll be fine.
-----
CaviarMeths: Just noticed the delay. Still in to download it.

Derrick01: I got a deal for a One X and now I have it for $399 at Best Buy in Canada. I think best buy is a legit store so maybe they got a deal on that already? I was hoping they would have shipped me the One X but that was strange.
-----
graywolf323: yes
-----

-----
Imitation: Thats what MS is for.
-----
Oachc: I came in here to see if I could get a One X a few weeks early. Ended up getting it in a few weeks after that.

-----
Daffy Duck: I think you can buy a few extra bucks on Amazon for a One X.
-----
Theorry: They sell at least a 1X.
-----

Kraken3dfx: I thought that the X, while still underpowered, is really good value, I don't think there is anything special about it. I've had mine since like launch and still love it.

~!~What do you do when it’s a slow news day for a game?

Kadin: We're living in a time where it's a slow news day for a game and I have to decide what I should spend my time playing.
I'll be playing it because I know I'm going to enjoy it a lot and if it's a game I'm confident in it will be enjoyable. I know it won't be full of slow down moments but I'll be be beign watching what the team do and what happens next.
If it's a game I know I know I'll enjoy and I'm not sure if it's something I'll be getting excited about, I'll just be having a good time. It's a slow news day for me when I know what I'm in for and if it's a game I'll be enjoying it.
What am you doing?
-----
HockeyGuy412: Just playing it and once the save is loaded I jump into the tutorial portion and head back to bed
-----
Ahasverus: I'm playing it and checking the forums. I'll watch stuff on the YouTube channel or streams from the developers I'm playing with or there's a forum post I post.
-----
Cipher Peon: I’m starting the week off better than ever. I’ve had a blast playing games in the past couple of weeks and I’m even more confident in my abilities and commitment to playing them now than I was last year
-----
Pogogacy: I like slow news day, so I tend to wait for news to be posted and for videos to go up. But I like it now to play games, especially if they're lengthy games (big open world games for example).
-----
Bhonar: I usually wait until the end of the week. I like that because it gives me space to play apart from the game
-----
kubev: I'm really enjoying it so far. It's all been enjoyable. I've been really into the occasional bit of podcasts and whatnot. It's far too convenient.
-----
Falchion: I'm planning to play more games this week.

~!~BBC: Why 'Top Paid' Video Games Are Important to the Industry

Gn0mercy: 
-----
Lashley: I think most people agree with the statement, but personally speaking, I don't think it's a stretch to say that they make sense outside the context of this industry, and I don't think it's particularly hard to see parallels between them and video games in general.
-----
Ant_17: Who the fuck does Top Paid make a fuckton?
-----
FluxWaveZ: The phrase "top paid" is a fairly accurate truetorian of what's happening in game marketing these days. It's a way of saying that, at most, if you pay top-line talent and writers to make games and publishers try to milk those writers as much as possible, and sometimes that's not enough.
-----
Orin: Thats a pretty fair criticism.
But people still use the phraseTop Paid.
-----
Kolx: That's not really accurate either. You can see an industry in a lot of other industries that does those sorts of things which isn't really something that's needed or desired.

~!~Let's talk about next-gen graphics: what's the baseline, are we stuck with it?

Flux: Let's be real: games are expensive. This generation we have seen multiple big AAA releases, we have seen cross-gen versions. We have seen next-gen versions (and their respective techs being outdated for the next generation). We have seen next-gen versions of games that are a year and a half behind.
This generation is very difficult to make a difference to the baseline, and I would honestly be surprised if we would even want to think about this heading into next-gen. Of course we will be getting new hardware in 2020, but that won't be a thing.
We can do with technology what, in real-time?
-----
Cess007: I'd say that's a pretty good baseline, and it'd be interesting to see what games can do before we set the bar even higher again.
-----
Nirolak: I assume that the PS5 is going to be backwards compatible with PS4 content.
-----
Aokiji: The switch is already a baseline and there’s nothing anyone can do to win back gamers with inferior hardware
-----
Zukuu: I'd say it's a fair baseline. They're at the beginning of next-gen consoles and, as such, will likely offer a large boost for the install base.
-----
Chaserjoey: I don’t think it’s a realistic baseline.
-----
Conciliator: It's a good one, I think it will be far more interesting looking at the new consoles.
-----
Granjinha: Digital is important, I think the baseline is good, but it's a good one for sure.
-----
Lackless: Next-gen consoles will be as clean and clean as the PS4 Pro.
-----
Zippro: I mean, it's not even a real baseline. I'd say that it's not a good baseline for next-gen. It's not a good enough one to judge a game at all.

~!~My Nintendo Switch Online Trial is almost over!

Forkball: I just submitted a ticket to the trial and it's not even loading. I submitted a paper so they better give me my payment info!
I've replaced the Joy-Con and detached the sensor from my console and the gamepad and the trial is running out. Have a friend who has had his subscription for a few months and he's complaining of constant connection issues, and I've seen on the Switch app that the subscription is showing up as invalid.
Is there any way around this? Anyone else have problems with their Nintendo Switch online trial?
-----
Lite_Agent: It's on the app, it's pending until 10am UTC.
-----
Etrian Darkness: I don't think it's working as intended for you and I've seen it in other parties. I've had a few people and companies complain about it and it's driving me crazy.
-----
justiceiro: Thanks OP. I'll suggest to format the sensor, and make sure you're not pre-ordering an online trial, hopefully soon.
-----
Pancracio17: It’s on the app on the Switch.
-----
CormoranStrike: Yeah, prob should format the sensor and wait for the service to update, also noticed there is a sensor on the bottom right. Hope you can fix that issue.
-----
Forkball: I've noticed in several other people it's working fine.
-----
LordKano: I'm pre ordering digitally, just in case someone can help me.
-----
Forkball: Just grabbed it.
-----
cw_sasuke: Tried that for a few people. 
Problem with the system is no one tells you why is preordering, it's like everyone has the same product. Plus the wait is usually 1h longer to get it from the retailer. 
PS - this is not a Nintendo problem. This is a Nintendo problem.

~!~I can't get past the main quest in Fallout 76 (Major Story spoilers)

TheBeardedOne: I've just started the game and I'm enjoying it, but I can't get over how bad the road trip portion of the game is. It's a very good journey, but the actual story in the game is just... bad.
The story starts with a very brief quest.
The main quest is, oddly, very short and without much in the way of meaningful interaction. It's basically:
"The world is a wasteland. Helghast are now in the hands of the ancient evil. They will slaughter your people and your artifacts and magic. You will be free to go on their wild ride. You can explore New Reno or Sanley if you want. Or head to Shady Ops if you want. Or head West Virginia to hell. Or go into Fallout 76 and the Mojave together. Or go straight to hell in Fallout 76: you can no longer progress in the story".
The story doesn't really end, but the world is designed to be explored. They've put quests in for the wasteland to talk about, but the quests of the first game are in constant-loop segments, and the locations you visit in this game are not visited in any part of the game. It's like they didn't care about the story at all. They just wanted to finish the game.
Just when you think "Hey, give me the items I need," you'll be really, really turned off from the Main Story of Fallout 76. They straight up told you the story in no logical way. They didn't explain it well at all. There's probably some scattered bits here, and there are some really confusing ones, but it's just such a disjointed, half-assed, half-meditated story.
It's not a particularly good ending either, but it's the logical next step from the series.
It's also actually kind of fitting with the game's universe. They wanted to tell a Fallout story set in the New Reno.
The ending is kind of pointless. They told you that the vault hunters are back, and you're out of the main story now. They told you that the train is coming to a stop. They told you that you can't save everyone. They told you that there's something on the planet for you. They told you that the Railroad is coming. They told you that

~!~"The Sword of Truth" creator makes it his mission to make a "Rpg"

SOLDIER: Background: I'm not going to get into too much detail as to how the game came about, or what it's actually supposed to be supposed to be, but I will say that my understanding of the game is one that I will take as a given. Allowing it to be a "true trilogy" doesn't change the fact that it is a followup to some of the more famous Xenoblade games. The story is a straightforward middle-ground between the main story and the side quests of Xenoblade Chronicles X, with the protagonist being a boy who was raised by his dad at a time when he was young. The protagonist is the protagonist of Ys VIII who is in her late-20s, mid-late-30s years period, and is asked to follow a young samurai named Saori who has escaped death at the hands of a powerful Tokido. The protagonist is an American named Arthur.
In the game, the protagonist is dropped at the jun, the jun he leaves from the main story and is given a code to erase from memory. This code is used throughout the main story of the game, and will grant the player a true RPG experience.
Spoiler
This code is used to progress the story of a character Saori after the player has beaten the main story. It is not uncommon to be locked on a specific jun in the game, but the game allows you to use any code that is found in the game. The player can choose to "make it into the" a code, which is an optional transition that changes the world and the appearance of a character in the game.
This code is used to progress the main story, and it eventually leads to a place called the Sword of Truth. This is a place where Saori meets with all the characters he's been controlling since he escaped his cell in 1989, and is given a code to open his journal. The player must go there before the code is allowed to grant the player a true RPG experience, where it's simple and stays open throughout the entire game.
Spoiler
The Sword of Truth is one of the best things about the game, and is one of the best RPGs that have ever been played. The fact that it is a code that can only be used in-game is great. However, it's not entirely because of the design of the

Masterspeed: I don't know. I could have just skimmed the title and just stuff. 
But it's just a collection of games in a series. I know the games are great. I know what they are and what they're good for. 
It's not going to stop me from playing them.

ScOULaris: Nintendo has been making some of the most interesting gaming lunatics in recent history. Their hybrid handheld concept of a smartphone, accessory system that towers over home consoles in both handheld and docked form, and a home screen capable of upscaling entire AAA libraries down the pipeline. I think it's time the company revisits this genre once again, and the next step up their handheld effort is a new take on the handheld genre.

~!~Fire Emblem Heroes: Remember me – why I like Fire Emblem and why it's always a part of my play schedule

WrenchNinja: I've been playing Fire Emblem Heroes for a while and there's so much to unlock and do. I've always been a fan of playing Fire Emblem, but this is different.
There's no time limit (no story), but you can go into the game and complete objectives. They have tasks that you can only do one of, like battling a boss. They allow you to play in different ways, like using the lancer to set traps for your enemies and traverse through dungeons.
It's a very unique game, and a really fun one. However, I just love playing it, and I think it's my favorite FE game. It's hard to describe, but I think it's the most fun I've had playing a Fire Emblem game.
So tell me, what do you love about FE, and what do you love about FE Heroes?
-----
Shug: Also got the fur crit for the first time. The game is fun and the characters are fun to play as too.

~!~What's Next for Pokemon 2019?

Phantom Thief: Tonight, we have a special announcement: Pokemon 2019. It's been a year since the announcement of the game. So I wanted to take a moment to reflect on what was announced and what we will likely see in Pokemon 2019 before Nintendo 2019.
That being said, let's talk about what we expect for 2019.
New First-Party IPs
Nintendo is clearly going to acquire some new first-party IPs in 2019. They're putting all their resources into the next generation, and it doesn't make sense for them to let that expire. They're probably going to start acquiring more IPs next year, but it makes sense to start letting those expire expire after they announce that the next generation is coming to a end.
Pokemon 2019 will probably be the last game in the series until after the new Pokemon generation, and Pokemon fans will probably be playing the new generation for the next few years.
Third-Party IPs
The new Pokemon generation is a new one, and it makes sense for Nintendo to start expanding the lineup of games they have coming their way. They're interested in expanding their western lineup, too. Three of the games they're most interested in are New IPs, Pokemon, and Third-Party IPs.
Pokémon 2019 is going to be the last game in the series until Nintendo's new generation.
Third-Party IPs
First-party IPs are being considered next year, and I suspect they'll be part of a larger series of announcements for the year. Pokemon fans will probably be playing the new generation for the next few years, too.
Third-party IPs
This is going to be tough for Nintendo, as they're trying to keep up with the new game launches and the third-party IPs that are coming out. Pokemon fans will probably be playing the new generation for the first time, too.
Third-party IPs
First-party IPs are probably the only ones that are really being left standing. That's not to say Nintendo doesn't want to return to its old style, but it is limiting. They're probably going to continue to be a Nintendo all-platform owner, though.
I think Pokemon 2019 is going to be the last game in the series for the next year.
Third-Party IPs
This is a step backwards for Nintendo. The new Pokemon game will probably be a part of the

~!~Does anyone remember the "Gran Turismo Sport" tweet?

trisbee: I just saw this tweet today about how Gran Turismo Sport was auto-saved for the whole life of the game. I'm wondering if anyone wants to revisit that tweet.
You can see the tweet in action here: 
I definitely don't want to do this. I think the tweet is incredibly misleading and manipulative.
What do you think?
-----
dietpepsi: I don't remember it, but I think it was a "forced retirement" thing, and I think the twitter account is the sole reason the game has that kind of attention.
-----
Kyser73: That is a pretty representative sample of the entire tweet. That's definitely a rare case of unintended consequences.
-----
D65: I always get that Gran Turismo email
-----
Elandyll: I did.
I don't remember it, but it's still worth a damn for that.
It's also relevant to me now, due to the Olympic Games, which is my country's de facto national competition, and because I know the game's reputation is suffering.
I feel we need a Gran Turismo more than ever. I remember reading Gran Turismo magazine as late as high school (it got a lot of shit at the time, lol) and being completely blown away by all the features and graphics.
-----
Real Renaissance Man: I was just thinking earlier today about how much I love the PS2 era Forza, and how much I personally like the older series.
Granted, the online it seems to be the only option to try all the races in the game after you've started, but I'm not sure why it's such a bad idea to just leave your friends tied to races when you're already the most skilled.

plngsplsh: I would like to end this thread.

~!~If you haven’t played Kingdom Hearts II FINAL Episode: The Complete First Season yet, now is a great time!

Chaserjoey: Recently I started playing Kingdom Hearts II Final Episode: The Complete First Season, and it’s been a blast. It’s also got me thinking about the first season of the Final Episode where everything was going on and it’s all about how fucking awesome it felt going into the distance.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt more excited playing a video game than to actually start playing the first episode!
So with that said, what do you guys think of the first season of the Final Episode of Kingdom Hearts III? Are there any favourite moments, narrative or gameplay moments, that you guys think are really REALLY good? And what about you, would you be interested in playing KH3 if you could experience it in the first place?

chandoog: I'd say The World Ends With You.

I’ve always found KH's gameplay to be a little shallower than it needs to be, but this one is probably my favourite.

Dreamboum: Resident Evil 2 is the single most memorable and endearing series of games of all time. A game that has been gifted the middle finger in its lifetime. A game that managed to find the perfect formula that could be applied to all kinds of horror. Resident Evil 2
The atmosphere and the music are unforgettable. The story is hype. The characters are endearing and wonderful. The atmosphere is right up there with other classic games. It always manages to reach a pure, honest, and emotional quality without over-saturating tone or over-explanatory opening sections. It's not about the corny melodrama or the over-adverted side characters, it's about the stomach acid trip. The game has a fine library of endearing but iconic characters and the ending is

Omar310: I'm looking for a name for a quick way to play Kingdom Hearts III in my local library. I'm not sure what the most common use "local" gaming terminology is, but I understand a "Keyblade" is basically a key.
I'm considering trying out Kingdom Hearts 3 the first time for sure. Is this the best way to play? Also, if I play on PS4, is there any way to play without the KH keyblade?
-----
Abu_Ibrah!: I don't think there's a way to Keyblade up. You'd just have to abuse them and hope to get them enough so you can get good.
-----
WrenchNinja: You could just try and find the Keyblade that are used in the demo for Kingdom Hearts 3, they are rare and expensive.
-----
Neufr0: Have you tried just playing with the normal keyblades or do you have to grind stuff to get them?
-----
Omar310: I have no clue about the keyblades. I have to grind the thing to get good, even with all the EXP and stuff.
-----
Omar310: Yeah I don't have any specific keyblade name, since I don't have a specific collection of them.
-----
Omar310: Yeah, I mean, the only way you could Keyblade up is just having some experience. And I mean that, there's a lot of experience. I don't know what keyblade to have in that particular Kingdom Hearts game.
-----
Omar310: On yea, from what I remember, there's a keyblade that's very useful in this, but if you don't have that you're not gonna get that much use out of it.

Mikey Jr.: No, it's not the keyblade themselves.
The easiest way to get them is just having fun with them.

~!~The Final Fantasy IX Remake is in development, but there is no way to confirm if it is for real

Jailace: I searched but couldn't find a thread about it. 
There was a brief search for "Final Fantasy IX Remake" and "Final Fantasy IX Remake" threads and nothing came up. 
I'm not sure if this is common or people searched for all the threads about this, but this came up as time to play the remake, so I decided to make a thread to see if I could play it for myself. 
I played the game yesterday. I'm about an hour and a half in and think this is the most beautiful game on the PS4. I don't know why I'm playing this game, I just like it. I'm loving it so far. 
However, a bit of history:
- the Remake was actually made by two different people. One of them who worked on the original FFVII and IX (Lin Hien) was actually the director of the game since development began. That was actually the first time I saw a video game credited as director on the PS4.
- the original producer Lin Hien (who is now the director of the game) was the lead designer for the original PS4 version. The other was the director of the remake (Lin Hien).
- they worked with FF7 in the past (they worked on FF10 and FF9)
- they gave the remake a new director and a new art director, but they decided not to remake this game. They just wanted to make FF9.
- to use some info from the wiki, they went into the remake to make sure this was a worthy project.
- Lin Hien was the lead designer of the original PS3 and PS2 versions. He was the lead designer for the remake version of the game, but he did the actual remake version of the game.
- he did the remake version of the game, which is why they decided to remake this game.
- he also had a assistant director for the remake version, which was made by him.
- they hired a lot of tech workers to make the remake, and did a lot of side projects for them (some of which got finished by the original staff).
- they did a lot of small vignettes of the old characters.
- they also did a task force to improve the

~!~Which was the first game to make you feel sick?

Lady Bow: To start, there have been a lot of trends lately for games to release in order to try and get new customers. From getting more players to just getting more money from sales, two franchises that are known for their insane turnaround is what got me in the wrong. I mean I know what I'm talking about. I just don't get it. And I think this is a common sentiment across all parts of the internet though not all of era. I'm not saying it's a good thing, I get it. But I don't think people are wrong.
-----
TheBaldwin: MGS2 is the first game that made me feel sick, I thought it was the last game i be like "yehh..that was gameplay focused.."
The 3rd game that followed followed, but i was a little bit under powered and was very disappointed with how it handled.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Uncharted 4.
Would have been better if they had a mode that let you choose how much items you could grab or grab from enemies.
-----
ShutterMunster: The first Witcher 3 had a mechanic that made me feel sick, and was the reason I couldn't play the game. I have no idea when it first popped up in the OT, but it definitely did in those games.
-----
Spinky: Assassin's Creed 2.
I have no idea why it took them so long to realize that.
-----
BubbleButt64: I remember thinking it was funny when Nintendo said they were done making Mario games and the first person they'd done was "we made that up".
-----
Funyarinpa: MGS3
The first time I played it I was like "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS"
-----
4859: Centipede.
I was so hyped because of what it was and the hype I was getting.
-----
Cess007: Metroid Prime Hunters.
I felt like I was playing a character in a racing game, and I completely didn't understand the purpose of the character. I was playing as a Triforce Hunter, and I was just playing the hell out of that character. Then I played Metroid Prime and I was like "I wish I could play this without having to think about the campaign".

~!~Does anyone with a blurry ps4 have a heads up on adding vsync via hd.sys to the latest firmware?

sambills: Hi there
i have a 1080p screen and I am having some hd sync issues. My left analogue is blurry and my right analog is blurry. Both are supposed to be doing Vsync, right? When I make a capture and switch to keyboard and mouse, the resolutions are the same. When I switch to keyboard and mouse, the resolution is same.
When I make a video capture and switch to TV, the resolution is the same and the hd signal is crisp but is being supported. But my TV does not sync, I have a 1080p screen. Is this something I should be worried about?
Do I need to update my firmware to have vsync working?
-----
Jasbasse: I'm not sure if this would be a problem.
-----
Bjones: I’m not sure what this would mean but I’d like to change my tv firmware to allow vsync to same 1080p hd.

nib95: I don't think it's too far fetched, but it's something that I'll try if I have the time. It's a FIFA game and it'll be fun to play.

SinCItyAssassin: The pause button is like the button to press the button to pause the game.

====================
~!~What happened to the Switch eShop?

Tohsaka: I think the Switch eShop is doing a bad job when it comes to getting games out for it's Nintendo games.
The first and most obvious example is the Switch port of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.
Now, the game has never had much press so far, and even with a logo like that, it's clear that it won't be released for the system.
At launch, there were no games that looked like they were from Nintendo's catalog. While SMT and DQXI were ported, they were often not original games.
Nowadays, we have two big Nintendo IPs coming in to the Switch library, with the main one being Luigi's Mansion, a game that doesn't really need Nintendo's spotlight.
Now, Luigi's Mansion 3 has been announced, and it's going to be the third title in the series that Luigi's Mansion: Toadstool Racers was ported for.
Now, we are in 2019, and we are not ready to go back to ports from Nintendo. However, we still have the possibility to release Luigi's Mansion 3, but the chances of getting the third title are very low.
Now, let's see what happens if we release Luigi's Mansion 3 at the same time.
First of all, it's extremely unlikely that Luigi's Mansion 3 will be released at the same time as Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon.
Secondly, it's very likely that Luigi's Mansion 3 will be released simultaneously.
Thirdly, it's extremely unlikely that Luigi's Mansion Trilogy will not be planned for release on Switch.
So, what do you think?
-----
adam prime: I think the main point is that they're porting existing games to the Switch.
-----
Arta: They did that with Dark Moon and then sold off all their output.
-----
Deleted member 42686: I'd say the chances are very low.
-----
Darknight: Luigi's Mansion 3 is my dream game. A Luigi's Mansion 3 for 3DS would be amazing.
-----
Mediking: It's not that much of a difference. LMAO!
-----
Aigis: Yeah, I think it's gonna happen. I think it's possible, but I doubt it. I didnt think it would happen.
Now I just want a Luigi's Mansion 3, but

~!~How's the PS4 Pro's performance?

Wololo: I took this picture of mine from a few months ago. I'm curious what everyone's experiences are on the Pro. I'm using it on my desktop but it's not running at full speed. There are games which do this better. I currently use a 50" TV and if I was to use it on a Pro, it would normally be a 1080p screen.
-----
dmaul1114: I have a regular PS4 with a 1080p TV.
I've also done 1080P in some titles like God of War, Far Cry 5, and Detroit with a bit of tweaking.
-----
s3ltz3r: I agree.
Seems like a PS4 Pro 2.5 inch.
-----
B4mv: I was just looking at this on the windows store. What's your usage case?
-----
dietpepsi: I have a 1080p TV and I'm happy with it. I just wish I could use it elsewhere but I'm sure my wife would be thrilled.

Some preview coverage.
-----
ZiZ: I'm not really a gaming mag but I'll check some of these out.
-----
Remij: I always loved the previews of these magazines.
I always feel a bit bad for those who don't like how they preview games.
-----
Admiral Woofington: Yeah I'm not really interested in any of them honestly.
I tend to read them anyway.
-----
FairyEmpire: I love all the previews they get. It's a lot of the time writers don't know what to do, and that's a reason why I love to have a preview thread for all the previews we read.
-----
Admiral Woofington: Yeah I'll read some of them.
-----
ZiggyPalffyLA: I like that they are putting out more of the best things.

~!~Games with multiple ending themes?

Thewonandonly: Ok I’m just doing a playthrough of Fallout 76 and while I finished my playthrough I heard multiple endings and decided to play through the single player story with multiple ending themes. 
I’d love to know which ones people have played and which ones have only recently played and know the context of them better. 
Is there any games out there that do it better than others? I haven’t played a lot but hearthstone and that weird tower stuff makes it all the more satisfying.
-----
Dr. Caroll: I would argue that the games that do multiple endings tend to be shitty. A lot of the games you'd describe are quite bad.
-----
Thewonandonly: That’s what I’m asking. Does mp seem lacking also?
-----
Thewonandonly: I played it when it first came out and it was pretty good. I kind of like it but just ended up grinding some stupid stupid grind to get to the point where I couldn’t stop playing lol. I’ve been meaning to try another game though and I’m gonna wait for the Switch version
-----
WrenchNinja: I feel like multiple endings are a huge shift.
The Witness, God of War, Uncharted 4, and Far Cry 5 all offer multiple ending that make the player think “I know it’s going to end this way,” and that’s only in the Uncharted games where you can go back and forth between multiple endings. I think the general consensus is that multiple endings feels like a cop out and a detriment to pacing.
-----
WrenchNinja: I think there's only really two games that do multiple endings like Until Dawn.
-----
Keratay: I remember playing through Nier Automata and thinking "Why the fuck are the Nier games ending?" and my devil may cry just stuck with me.
-----
Silky: Just play the ones you like OP. The pacing in Nier Automata is worse than Automata.
-----
Kromeo: I think you're missing one of the best endings in any game ever
I would argue that the games you listed are better in their approach to multiple endings than the ones you describe

====================
~!~What are the chances the Dragon Ball FighterZ DLC characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will appear in future DLC?

ScreamingMadden: This is something I was wondering and I’d imagine a lot of people are pretty interested in. The DLC characters are what I’d normally be talking about in the Smash thread but the topic is about the inevitable (and I believe a lot overdue) DLC characters in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Obviously Nintendo has some internal fighting game engines that they can use to make these appear in future DLC and it makes sense to make these appear in future games more easily. Do you think it’d be smart of them to just make them appear in the DLC so that people can see what the crossover characters look like in future games?
-----
Kewlmyc: They are already in there.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: They aren't
-----
Jawmuncher: Considering they're going to be in there somewhere. It's a no brainer.
-----
Zalman: I bet most people wouldn't care for it.
-----
ScreamingMadden: I’m thinking the big thing that most of the Smash DLC is supposed to be.
-----
Tricky I Shadow: Characters:
-----
KraytarJ: Not even sure why they’d put them in there. Maybe for the bonus stages or whatever, but not for the Fighters Pass.
-----
Usyren: Yeah, would've thought they would appear in future DLC.

ScreamingMadden: Pfff, I think they're a given but...yeah. 
I’d have to assume for FighterZ itself.

~!~Is the lack of any sort of any form of MP in Red Dead 2 the biggest omission from the latest patch?

Rangerx: Does anyone remember after the last patch the lack of MP or any sort of even multiplayer mode? It never really took off in the first place until now.
The last time I remember it a multiplayer mode was in the game was late 2016. I don't think I've ever had a multiplayer match in a game since.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Didn’t they improve the CoD MP in RDR2 a lot during early access?
-----
Kolx: I'm not sure they've ever added MP. That seems like too much.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: No. They said they were working on it. I don't think they have added it.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Ah, fine. I’m sure they’ll get it. They just haven’t started it yet since the preorder stuff hasn’t gone on sale at all.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I just played the first mission and adored it.
-----
Rangerx: Yeah, when the game was first announced they said they were working on it. I don't think I've ever seen any kind of MP. I've just watched a friend play the game with a friend and had a blast with it.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: They only had like 2-3 multiplayer modes, yeah? I think the first one was a boss rush with a couple of online modes and a few single player modes.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I think it was when they announced it on the Xbox preorder pack but I can’t find anything about it
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I guess they just haven’t announced multiplayer. Perhaps they’re saving those for the full game.

Yoshichan: On mobile?
Mobile game, new IP, coming to Nintendo Switch.
-----
Escalario: I thought XCOM was actually a 2016 remake?
-----
Toumari: Looks interesting. I guess it's not the kind of XCOM game where you can see enemy spawns and the map layout.
-----
Strings: From what little I can tell, it's actually on the same concept as the first XCOM game, where you can see the AI on the field versus the player. So it's not totally different, but still different enough.
-----
HockeyGuy412: XCOM 2 is one of the best games ever
-----
Pimienta: Man, I would love to play this. Never finished 2, but it was fun to mess around in with X-Com
-----
Hailinel: "XCOM-like" isn't the right word.

Tizoc: Yeah, I just read the thread title and I was like "this sounds like something you'd find out from a hearing check of a warhammer profiler".

Slayven: I remember hearing about this game years ago, but I had no idea it came out on ps4. When i read the name, i thought it was an XCOM game, but looking it up did nothing for me then.

~!~All these amazing games I play with the Switch can be a real chore

MDSVeritas: So I've been playing some of these Switch-specific games that are a real distraction from my other obligations, like Octopath Traveler and DK Tropical Freeze, and I've realized that it's a real chore to organize my Switch library. It's not that these games aren't fun, but they're also not the best representation of what I want in an open-world platform shooter.
I've been playing Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and noticed that I rarely get any Xenoblade items. I've read that there are several XC2 Torna dungeons and that Nintendo will be able to tailor the experience for you. I've also noticed that if I just equip Octorae and follow the train path, I can climb up those dungeons and explore.
And I've found that I can get some good puzzles in Bayonetta. I've been playing the Platinum demo and the first area has a very good "open-world" approach. You follow a train and you'll run into a huge number of regular enemies. You'll encounter a lot of interesting puzzles and platforming challenges. I haven't found a single annoying enemy.
And I've found the Switch's dock-based puzzles to be a very good representation of how I want the idea of throwing my console at the screen to enjoy some good games.
I'm playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild right now, and for the longest time I was enraptured by the idea of being able to just turn the Switch on and explore the vast BotW world. Having the dock turned off (and not having an indicator that it could still be turned on) meant I could play a bit of Pikmin 1 or 2 and enjoy the levels. Playing as a sword slung in my bag and the knockoff minimax added a nice touch about the platformer. It's great to have the minimax back, but it's not exactly something I particularly want from a game where my only way of traversing the world is by using my wand.
I'm also playing Mario Odyssey, and having the minimax turned off (and not having an indicator that it could still be turned on) means I could still be playing as Luigi, but I haven't had a moment of excitement around the minimax as a result.
And I'm not thinking that, in spite of all that effort, any

~!~Why is there no turning back now that I beat Resident Evil 2 Remake? (SPOILERS)

Masterspeed: I've played RE7 and REmake recently. My friend was obsessed with RE2 so when RE2 came out, I got a new PS3 and got back into it and I thought I'd play it.
I just beat REmake last week and I'm having a blast and I don't think I can go back. I know so little of the story that I barely even remember what the fuck was going on but it's just so good. I just wish the ink was ink.
-----
Sir Guts: You’re not allowed to add spoilers!
-----
Asbsand: I think it's because every game is different, and this one had some really intelligent storytelling at some points. I'd love to see more of it.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think the main stuff is much deeper and more emotional. Revived some of the memories of the retcon.
-----
Aurc: To answer your question, because of your response to the lack of retcons, I feel you, OP. The game is good, but it's not perfect.
I can understand not wanting to retutorialize everyone, but that's one thing they need to learn in order to actually play it. I agree with the premise of your post though.
-----
Manu: It's not just about playing the games correctly.
-----
Dr. Caroll: I think you're more talking and talking in general about critiques of modern game design, rather than just your idealistic, elitist world. Trying to play RE1 or RE2 was a mistake.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: Yes, it's a problem.
I enjoyed the game but it didn't matter just because I was playing it wrong.
-----
SofNascimento: I really need to play RE2 remake and learn how to read.

Apparently this is a game called Remote Play for PS4, a 3D TV remote play game that is similar to Remote Play with a 3D TV user on a phone. The video is in German but someone on the forum pointed out that it's playable with a smartphone.

~!~Could the new Smash Bros be the first in the series to have a localised roster?

Wamb0wneD: This is a question I've been ponding, I really want to know as well. I've been playing smash regularly and this is the first Smash game that I've completed in over 10 years. I know that there are a few things that I personally can't stand and that's mainly it's small roster.
The roster in this game is obviously hand drawn, but the backgrounds look really good. I couldn't find a better gif showcasing this. It's interesting to see a fighting game with a lot of characters put into one image.
But what about Nintendo themselves? They release a dozen of characters at any given time and if they're going for a new character it's going to feel slightly out of place.
They release characters for every platform, but I'm wondering if they could do more in this series? It feels more like Sakurai wanted to give more weight to the Smash he's known for.
I'm not gonna lie, I've never played this game and I doubt I've played a lot of Smash, but I'm thinking that this could be the first game to do this.
So what do you guys think?
-----
brokeastronaut: I think it could be. I'm not a huge fan of the sprite work, but I like the idea.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I think it could be done, but yeah, it's a long ways off.
-----
Crayon: I think Smash 2019 is going to be an entirely different series.
-----
Mediking: .
-----
Brock Reiher: There's no way it's this successful franchise, Nintendo can easily design a better roster than this. It's going to have characters that you can't play without in most other games
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it’s very possible.
I’m not sure it’ll be a smash Bros franchise.
It’ll probably just be another fighting game.
I think it’d be cool though.

Grunge_Hamster: The amount of effort that would need to be put in to create a roster of dozens of characters to promote Smash Bros and put them on the game is a lot less likely to happen than it used to be.

~!~Theory: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Remake or: How to Tell a Non-Spoilable Plotline without KOS-MOS

Phendrift: The thread got me thinking about this. I know a lot of people have been talking about this in the media for awhile, but I just think it’s worth discussing.
If you’re unfamiliar, or have played a Link’s Awakening or Dark Souls before, I strongly believe it makes a good case for the slow-burning, non-linear narrative in Zelda games. It can help explain a lot of Zelda plot developments in detail.
It also opens up the possibility of telling important story-buttonservers about the game.
Few examples can be made without resorting to exhaustive re-writes, and even guided re-writes can be handy for people who want to completely re-create a scene or narrative without resort to excessive re-writes.
This thread is being made to offer discussion on the narrative power of storytelling in video games, and how Link’s Awakening can be seen as stat-driven, and how this idea can be applied to future media.
Link Arrives Back
The Link’s Awakening, by studying scenes throughout the series, is used to show how Link, at his return to the lost Hyrule, with all of its out-of-nowhere, bizarre and dangerous situations, is enveloped in an always-there world.
It is also the first game in the series that uses the term “Link Arrives Back” to describe the final dungeon of the first game.
The “Link Arrives Back” Terminology
The term “Link Arrives Back” refers to the final dungeon of the first game, the unarguable Wario Peaks.
Why does it mean to mean to describe the final dungeon of the first game? Well, because the phrase “Link Arrives” literally means “The Link Arrives.”
Because Link has been through this particular time and is in some sort of turmoil where he must warn the Links about the terrible, yet unnatural, condition they are in. He is haunted by his past, becoming lost, and is left to his fate as a mute protagonist.
Yet Link does not surrender, nor does he suffer. He is not a simple mute protagonist, nor does he need to resort

~!~What is the most difficult game ever uploaded to YouTube?

vestan: I was scrolling through my YouTube library and stumbled upon this one called "What is the FURIest Fighting Game Ever Made", which has been stuck in 4.1GB. I know it's in development but I have no idea how it's been able to last for such a game. I know it was very difficult to emulate but I guess I was just blown away. I guess it just comes down to how god damn cool it is to see these things bounce off of each other and they end up looking like one of those super high quality movies you might actually like.
I'm really surprised Capcom even bothered to port it to PC after they were done with Resident Evil 4. I'm not even sure if they even have the means to localize it considering it's not able to be done on the platform. Is there anyone who's played it on PC?
-----
Mitsurugi: I was already impressed by the graphics and graphics engine but I didn’t think it was as good as the SNES at the time. I’m glad it exists and there’s a console port. You should try it and see if it’s worth it!

Transistor: I remember when I first tried this game on my PC years ago, I was pretty amazed...

TheAggroCraig: I played it when I was in high school. It was an odd game but I remember it being very difficult to beat. The difficulty curve was really sharp and you could get really far in the beginning. It was also a very hard game to get the hang of.

To further prove my point, I decided to run through the entire game solo which I think is pretty fun, and

~!~What's so good about playing with headphones on a gaming headset?

Kthulhu: I've been thinking about this after just doing a bit of setup on my X and I just can't help but notice how much better the headset makes it look when you're using it in VR. I mean, I'm not saying you should listen to the mic, just practice the headset. It's really really easy to get good at this, especially with a headset not having a lot of bass.
I've been using my headset solely for headphones while I play games. I let the mic do most things, and I use it all the time when I play with the Aim Controller on the PS4 controller. When I play Overwatch with the Aim Controller, I can't really hear the mic anymore while playing. I was playing BFV with a dual 18l monopod at home with my pro and the mic was playing big so I could hear little shit when the match was going on and I couldn't hear my dual 18s constantly.
They sound AMAZING to me, plus I'm always in motion with the Aim Controller. But I kind of wonder why it's that when people talk about the headset having "no bass" why is there mic wire not really needed on other headsets? 
What's your experience with this? Is there a specific headset that is best for you and works well for you?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I use it a lot if it's paired with a wireless boost amp and it's super comfy and can do loads of neat maneuvers like distortion
-----
FernandoRocker: I use mine for all of my games.
-----
Carthago Delenda Est: I use it mostly for Destiny 2, Battlefield, and some other VR content. It's not wireless, though.
-----
Igorth: Never had a problem with wires, its wireless, cable management is better using a little adapter.
-----
aisback: I use it a lot with my PSVR and it has been great for me. I dont notice loud audio when using it outside of games. Its a wireless solution so nothing is blasting out of the thing.
Never had issues with the switch when it was running in docked mode, it is really rare
-----
Dremorak: I use it for everything, I think it works well for docked, its not a battery saving feature.

~!~Resident Evil 4: The Mercenaries expansion adds new map, Outbreak area and weapon

Dusk Golem: The Outbreak map is new, it seems like it adds new units, and the weapon they originally teased.
-----
TheMrPliskin: I still think they should have kept the base with the warehouse instead of Liberty City and the Kendo Kansada Kendo to keep everything under the same roof, but I guess they wanted to make the population more dangerous and that's why it's become a bit more suburban/incampropine style.
-----
Kenzodielocke: This.
-----
Dusk Golem: Yeah, I just realized that they pushed the Kendo Kansada Kendo a little bit after the update, but this is actually well behind the original's release date.
-----
Baccus: Kotaku is on it.
-----
HStallion: I'm so curious why this is getting mixed reviews on Steam.
-----
Furisco: The Kendo Kansada is a good addition
-----
Baccus: I think the game is good in people's opinion.

Dusk Golem: Kotaku's reviewer reviewing the game.

~!~Danganronpa fans, do you love the new Danganronpa?

King of Dreamland: Was just watching TV dubbed over the tv show, and the first time I heard of this series (or maybe I just watched TV while watching television.) did a quick google search and found absolutely nothing. I mean, I think I’m all about the visual novels, but I honestly don’t know anymore. All I know is that it’s a visual novel with a very low budget that ended up selling a lot of shit.
However, while watching TV, I realized something: the series came out a year ago in the West, and it was called Danganronpa.
The name means “Demon”.
Demon means powerful. In Japanese it’s the Knight of Darkness.
I am not a huge fan of visual novels, but Danganronpa is one of those series that’s actually kind of interesting, especially the second half of the series. And it’s always fun to read about the story and how the games ties into the themes of the story.
So, do you love the concept, or do you hate the execution that is the series executions?
-----
Transistor: It's a visual novel aesthetic driven by a protagonist that gets power.
-----
Riversands: Valkyria Chronicles was the first visual novel game that I played so I liked it a lot
-----
Phantom Thief: I don’t know why they decided to go for that. They definitely didn’t.
-----
Lux86: It's a visual novel (the art is not my thing)
-----
King of Dreamland: I'd be more interested if something like the original Danganronpa took place in the same world/region as the anime
-----
Dreamboum: I think the most interesting thing about the Danganronpa is the fact that it's a visual novel, a novel with a protagonist that's a power-hungry person who is obsessed with trying to kill all the monsters of the past world, and he's basically the final boss of that world’s plot. The story is the final puzzle of the anime, the game is its final antagonist, its final antagonist has been the main plot of the series for a long time.
It doesn’t make sense to me that they were

~!~What are some good games on the Switch that fix the "problem" with the system?

butman: I currently have a Switch and to my surprise I noticed that the games I mentioned are still underappreciated.
I was shocked when I saw that Mario Odyssey is on the Switch and it looks stunning, even better than the original.
I'm not a big fan of the music, but I assume it's because of the resolution.
The control scheme the Switch offers is not something I'm fond of.
The fact that most of the games are not even half as good is shocking.
The option to put all the games on the "docked mode" is pretty amazing, but the way the graphics are so high end and the porting process is basically "so good its good" is a big plus.
But what about the games?
Mario Odyssey and Pokemon Go are still being ported to handhelds the most.
Mario Kart and Zelda 2 are ports too, but they are not exactly this good.
But what are your favorites and what do you think of the games?
-----
Gegz: I think the problem is people's expectations for these Switch titles, and there's really not much you can do if you don't want to deal with the expectations of people who want to play portable games on their portable devices.
-----
TheMoon: and better versions of all those games are better versions of all those games.
-----
Arkeband: I’d probably go with Mario Odyssey since it’s already a fairly traditional JRPG. But Pokemon Go is a straight port/remake of the 3DS game, and it is fantastic.
-----
Viking Jesus: Honestly, I feel they're just trying to get people to double dip. The Switch hardware makes the Switch more desirable than a PC at the moment since you're able to play it natively portable.
-----
Jaded Alyx: The obvious answer is Mario Odyssey.
-----
BassForever: Really love the philosophy that Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Go and Smash are all pushing. 
Mario Odyssey I feel stapled to the 3ds, Mario Kart and Mario & Luigi are all the same thing and yet it appeals to me. 
Mario Odyssey
-----
Zool: Pokemon Go is amazing. The only thing I am missing is the ability to do a better 1080p game.

-----
Klobrille: Very nice.

Klobrille: So does that mean that they are dropping new content?
-----
JaseC: That's "A preview" for the next game. That's the extent of anything they can actually show during E3. They're just going to streamline it.

~!~What are some of the best RPGs of the last one?

nynt9: I remember when I originally played Final Fantasy 8, thinking it was amazing and I wanted to love it, but then I heard the DLC and thought it was just blah and blah. I ended up loving it though.
What are some of the best RPGs of the last one?
-----
Tohsaka: I'd say Chrono Cross.
-----
Derrick01: Dragon Quest V is actually the best one and I played about 10 hours of it over the course of a few months.
-----
gordofredito: FF9 and Chrono Cross are the same kind of games but better and with much better mechanics. I'd say it's FF1-2
-----
Death Penalty: Final Fantasy Tactics is a good series but they're old and dumb.
Planescape Torment is the best RPG series ever and still a top-notch rpg.
-----
lunarwhale: I only played 5 minutes of DQV, but I heard the story is much more interesting than DQ8. I love the combat system, though.
-----
Weltall Zero: I burned myself out on DQV so many years ago and finally quit. When I got to DQV, I was more than 80% in on nostalgia.
-----
Budi: I like to have a good time with RPG's and RPGs are fun are fun! I've been playing FF Tactics more recently on the PS3. The story is good too. There's a couple of really good sidequests, but not the best story in the series (favorites so far). The characters (and side characters) are just okay and not too memorable.
-----
Gnorman: I remember liking the story as well. I think FFT is the best and most realistic representation of the Japanese RPG culture.

~!~Resident Evil 2: First Person REmake

Jawmuncher: A few questions about this remake. The original release was the point of contention. The last time RE7 had a first person perspective, this time around it looks to be vastly different. The LODs are a little brighter for the perspective. Which of the 3 campaigns are your favorites? Which one do I need to see more of?
-----
KZXcellent: First person. I preferred the setting and atmosphere of the original RE2.
-----

SofNascimento: I just want to see Naughty Dog's take on first person. It's really gorgeous.
-----
Silky: I can't tell you why, but I can tell you it's gorgeous
-----
Regret: First person.
-----
The Horror the Horror: I want to see Naughty Dog's take on this.

LoudMouse: I love it. First person is my favourite.

~!~What are the chances we hear of a new Mario Kart Tour?

Lant_War: Mario Kart Tour hasn't even been announced, but it's been confirmed to be in development. It's a mobile spin-off of the series, so it's a big chance to show the mobile game coming out soon. Of course, the chances of that happening are pretty low, as only the DS and Wii had like 20-30+ mobile games (or so iirc).
What other brands are worth asking?
-----
Lant_War: Well, you could say the ones from Game Freak.
-----
stone616: I’d say Nintendo
-----
Jon Carter: I'm not really interested in Nintendo. I don't think Nintendo has any games that would be worth my time.
-----
Lite_Agent: They're too expensive. The DS/Wii had like 9-10 games. Switch is only just over 10/12 months old, so I don't know what they actually have currently.
-----
Lant_War: Of course we're not getting a new Mario Kart Tour.
-----
MisterHero: They don’t need to announce it before the end of the year. They can release it when the year ends.
-----
Cactuar: I think it's safe. Gamefreak can work on it after they finish with the DS and Wii U ports.
-----
Renna Hazel: Nintendo would be my guess. I think they will put out a new Kart Tour eventually.
-----
Lelouch0612: I'd say they need to announce it before the end of the year, because Wargroove had a mobile game ready to go.

~!~What's the best way to play the older Gran Turismo games on the PS2?

butman: I've heard many good things about GT Sport. I don't know if it's for PS3 or PS4 but I would be down for this.
I've tried:
GT: Sport
GT: Underground
GT: Shooters
GT: Underground 2
GT: Underground 3
GT: Paradise
I haven't had anything good to say about them, as far as playing the arcade versions. I would say GT Sport is the best option, as it's the one with the best gameplay and regular career mode.
-----
Doom_Bringer: I have GRID Autosport and I was so happy to get a new car for the arcade.
-----
Ifrit: I think GT Sport is the best option
But I am not sure if it works with the PS2 version
-----
AztecComplex: I have Gran Turismo Sport and it's pretty good. I had a lot of fun with it. It's not that old but I've played all the ones I own so I'm not sure what's the best but I would say GT Sport is the best.
-----
Pankratous: I remember reading a preview for Gran Turismo 3 around the time it came out and I was really interested and thought it was a bit of a bummer that it wasn't being made by the original team. 
Thankfully the Refurbished Car and Driver compatibility is now available and I have the original PS2 model that was already stored in my PS2 so I can play it.
-----
PaulloDEC: I dunno about everything else - I really liked Autosport, but I haven't tried Outrun or PD's GT games yet.
I've heard the PS2 version of Ridge Racer was pretty good for arcade racing.
-----
Ifrit: I don't own an original Ps2, but my PS2 used to have GT versions of Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer 2 was very enjoyable.
-----
Calverz: I read GT sport was based on Gran Turismo. I was surprised at how old the games were lol
-----
Baleoce: I played all the tought GT games, Ridge Rials, Outrun and a few others in the GT: Sport bundle.
And I loved all of them. I got into the racing genre

~!~Is there a way to get the Steam Controller controller to connect wirelessly?

Grimminski: So I got this adapter for my Steam Controller "Steam Controller" - by Hori.
They made a new one to use with the Steam Link app, and it works wonderfully.
Wired USB to USB adapter, but when I go to setup the Steam Link app to connect wirelessly to my laptop, it asks if I want to connect wirelessly, and I can do that automatically.
Can't get it to work. I have an adapter purchased a few months ago, but it works fine on a MacBook Pro (the controller itself is working as well, it just says "ready to connect").
The Steam Link app has a setting that if you want to connect to, it'll let you select which button to use wirelessly, but when I go to setup my laptop's Big Picture Mode, it forces me to select wirelessly, and it won't let me select the button that I need to connect wirelessly.
I tried a few ways to test this, and it was eventually resolved.
I tried setting up a wired USB hub, but the Steam Controller's default setting in there is still default to the hub.
Any ideas?

~!~I'm trying to understand a few topics about video game music and I'm not entirely sure why

delete12345: I'm playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey right now and I was just discussing how the music in the game is "uniquely and intentionally obscure".
Then I read about a few DJs doing some music for their sound bars, and I suddenly realized that this music has a very large chart which points to this:
I'm not completely sure what the chart is about, but I know that this chart is way bigger than the actual game-play video.
So, I ask all of you to help me understand:
What is the music in the game and the actual game-play video?
How does the actual game-play video fit into this chart?
I have no clue.
-----
delete12345: Hmmm, thanks.
Then I ask:
Is the music in the game-play video?
I notice the 12-hour chart, but I don't know if that's the actual game-play video.
-----
delete12345: Yeah, it's weird that I can't find the actual chart.
I can't find the actual chart either.
-----
Hieroph: Yeah that's kinda weird. You're not really supposed to know what's in the game-play video?
-----
delete12345: That's the case, but I am not sure how many DJs are actually jumping on board with the music in the game, and what is the general consensus on this game-play video?
-----
Hieroph: I am trying to understand it and I am not sure how to handle it.
-----
Hieroph: That is not the case, it is more a matter of when you start listening to the music. But I am not sure how to handle it.
-----
delete12345: I am listening.
-----
Hieroph: The thing I'm trying to say is that the DJs in AC games are not supposed to be in an environment with thousands of folks in it. They are very loosely connected to the crowd, and the DJs are often on a stage in front of you to monitor and to play the soundtracks.
Most of the time when I listen to the game-play video, I am very interested in the music. It's not a tour of audio or music form, it's just a video that

~!~Sparks, Nintendogs, and the Appreciation/Profit - Tips for a Newbie

Radishhead: Hey everyone.
I've been replaying Splatoon 2 recently, and I've been thinking about this a lot. Something that stuck out to me about Splatoon 2 is that it's a mess. It's a mess in almost every regard that I consider a "classic" Splatoon game.
The only Splatoon game that I've played to be that "classic". I've played the 3DS port and enjoyed it. I've played it a few times, but the controls just aren't as good as I'd like them to be. I've tried getting a tempered sprite or two, but it's just not as enjoyable as it was on PS2 and the competitive mode is a little too heated for my tastes. I've considered patches, but I'm leaning towards not touching online multiplayer at all.
I've read that Splatoon 2 is kind of a mess. The world building is great and the map design is actually good, but it's a mess in many different ways. You can see a lot of the plot threads that lead up to the story are terrible. The story is paced awfully and the maps are pretty boring, even though I know that's the direction they want to go. It's the beginning of a franchise that may seem long, but it's almost too fun to play now.
I know that Splatoon is a different game than the other games in the series, but I'm eager to talk to people about it.
TLDR: Tips for a Newbie
Basically:
- Splatoon is split into 3 "generations", the 3 "contests", you play as a "newbie", you get your first weapons, you training, Splatlings are reduced to Splatlings, you play as a trainer, the search and sniff out system is very limited, you can only pick up weapons in the map, you can't level up your Splatling, you can't fight in the Ink Ribbons, the game is kind of fun as a splatfest.
- Map layouts are different, Ink Ribbons are obtained far too early, you can't access the underground portion of the map, the world is dense, you can't find the treasures, but you can recruit them to your team.
- You are dumb, you can shoot ink as easily as moving a

TubaZef: The intro for Fallout 3/NV, upon intro being unsure what's up, when the game finally let me know what I should do, it was a bit too serious and I had to go to bed, so I gave up, next thought I was gonna give up, now I've gone through a really bad one
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: The best
-----

Cess007: It's probably not worth it, the music was bad and the first few seconds of the intro got old pretty fast. I would for sure give it another shot

PepsimanVsJoe: The best
-----
o Tesseract: The whole "obliterated sound makes you think twice about trying it" intro is so fucking awful.

SolVanderlyn: I have the feeling this is going to be the only Castlevania game to get a remake.
Back in late 2008 I played the demo for Mega Man X and it was the only one I bought and played for a long time. I couldn't find a decent playing spot and I really, really wish I could.
It's time to bring that old lovefest, remember?
-----
Glio: I remember the original boss fight getting a remake.
-----
The-Depth-In-Us: It was pretty good.
-----
KtotheRoc: I'd love to come back and play this again. I was on vacation from school in 2008 and I had to take my daughter to the visit. It was at a local library when I got up to read the first story line. Everything about the game was so charming.
-----
Xavi: I always liked how it was.
-----
Zubz: I’m a bit wary of this because it seems like it was made at Mega Man 11’s studio. But, I think the game was always going to be a somewhat forgettable experience for a lot of people. There was a lot of reading and replaying at the time, but the game really took that to heart, and it really left a mark on a lot of people.
-----
Svart: I still can't believe it's been 3 years since I played it.
Still hard to believe it was made.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: Oh man, I remember the hell out of this. My first time through it was when I was just a little kid and I had no idea what the hell Mega Man was.
It was the first time I'd played a Mega Man game and I didn't look back on the series as much as I would before.
The game was gorgeous, it was hard to find something to do in the game world, everything felt so alive.
The bosses, while tough, were brain dead.
So out of memory, I can only think of this game when I think about it. Hard to remember anything about it.
I can remember everything.
I thought it was a very good game, despite the terrible controls.

~!~SNK should pay its players a monthly check.

Jawmuncher: Regardless of whether there’s a lot of good games on the eshop or not, the SNK online service is the biggest thing for me right now. 
It’s been almost 3 years since the service went live and I’m still not happy with how they are trying to pay me based on how often I play. 
I’m not even sure a company could really compete with them in the current state. 
It’s the only reason I could even consider paying for the service. 
What do you all think? Should the SNK player get a monthly check for everything? Should paying SNK a check for their online services be more than a mandatory payment for online play or should they enjoy the perks of the SNK Online service?
-----
Rodney McKay: That's what I'm wondering with the way the online service is going. I'd be pretty pissed off.
I could see them being the one to pay for the monthly check, but I think they're the best in the business and I'd be on board with them.
-----
Aters: They should just not charge me.
-----
Lant_War: Why would it be my business to pay for what I don't want?
-----
L Thammy: I don't think they're the best in the business at all. I'm not even sure they're the best online service.
-----
TheCthultist: Maybe I should just quit and find a different company that would be more comfortable paying my credit card.
SNK is an institution that has taught me a valuable lesson
-----
Troller85: Why would you pay them a check for online play when you can just pay your credit card for online access?
-----
JoDa: I don't understand the SNK player question because that's not the kind of thing that would ever be possible, money isn't everything.

Now, I'm sure many will say it's Sora, and I'll say it again, it's Sora vs Pit.

~!~The Sonic The Hedgehog movie is an embarrassment

Flevance: I just watched this trailer from Cooler take and it was terrible. The villains in question are...
OddSonic - A Robotnik Hedgehog movie adaptation
Hedgehog SEGA - A Sonic movie adaptation
Hedgehog Network - A Sonic movie adaptation
HOWEVER THE FUCKING MADMAN WANTED ME TO BELIEVE!!!
I love when movie adaptations get the green light (or else they get denied)
-----
Cess007: I remember people saying that Hensher was supposed to be called "The Northerner's Muffle" in the trailer for the movie. I don't think this was ever ever addressed.
-----

Flevance: I really thought the hedgehog SEGA were Gamers right up until that one movie. I don't think it was ever discussed either. 
I guess the hedgehog SEGA would be upset that Sonic didn't look as good as his buddy
-----
Nakenorm: This.
-----
Stopdoor: I remember this randomly. I'm not even sure where I'd be seeing this in the current gaming meta.
-----
BubbleButt64: "The lead character was a robotnik and he has no hope of saving the world."
-----
ChaserX: I'm sure I read somewhere that he's not a very good player in the movie, and that the hedgehog SEGA really cares about the plot for the movie.
-----
Strike: Yeah, I remember this, and it made me laugh out loud.
-----
Aangster: I remember the movies playing and being hyped for the movie. I remember Id have no idea if "The Outer Worlds" ever got picked back for good.

~!~Should I get Ace Combat 7 after I'm done with AC8?

BAD: I've been playing AC7 a lot and it is a game that I got a little bored of after I beat AC7 but thought I'd give it another chance. I’m a huge fan of the series and thought AC7 was a wonderful game. 
I’ve heard some mixed things, some saying AC8 was too slow and slow was a welcome change to the formula, some saying it was too fast and the like. 
So what’s your opinion Era?
-----
Dynheart: I enjoyed it. I'd just wait for the sequel.
-----
VaporSnake: I mean, it's not a bad game, it's just that it's not a traditional AC game. I'm not a fan of the setting, the main protagonist is a total piece of shit, the whole game is AC and it's not for everyone.
The only AC game I've actually played was AC3, I mean, I'm not sure how well that game did but it was really bad. I also didn't get the slightest of enjoyment out of the story, and the game just tries to milk you to it's core. So I'm not really interested in 7.
-----
RumbleHumble: Yes, they're very good games. Skip it at first.
-----
Ratchetdude231: Yes!
AC7 is worth it IMO. I think it's the best AC/Synds game and it's available on Game Pass.
-----
Cubas: No. That's a bad game.
-----
BAD: I’m a fan of the series so I’d say no. I think it’s good but it starts off a bit slow and the story is rather confusing.
-----
KraytarJ: I think it's pretty good, and I'd add it to my list if you haven't already played it.
-----
RumbleHumble: What? No, not really. I'm a fan of the series, and this is by far my favorite one, so no.
I enjoyed the first game, and am a fan of the second one as well.

~!~Stealth Mode in Resident Evil 7: Remake fixed the piss poor bug in MP3

SofNascimento: Stealth Mode in Resident Evil 7 fixed the piss poor bug that was in the MP3.
It's the worst shit ever in the series.
How was the time?
-----
Dusk Golem: Yeah, they just wanted it to be a "weird" game, but it was a good game and they patched it out.
-----
nbnt: "We have to investigate, you can't do it..."
-----
SofNascimento: I was just thinking about this earlier, but then I remembered RE7 was right in the boat.
-----
L Thammy: Watch this game get nuked by helicopter at the end.
-----
HStallion: I think this is a bit of a one trick pony of the franchise if it's left open for a bunch of years.
-----
HStallion: I don't know what I was expecting when I read this but I loved it.

~!~Is it true that all the systems in a game can have “super high risk”?

demhax: For example, a game like Sonic Unleashed that has a high risk strategy with the enemies, you have a lot of time between attacks. So, if you are not having too many enemies, you have less time to reactivate the teamwork mechanic.
But I am always looking for tips and suggestions on this. So, I came upon this in my search results.
There are way more posts on Stack Overflow and Reddit than in my previous thread if I search for this. 
So, I am asking in the future for you to help me improve my post.
-----
Listonosh: No.
-----
Unknownlight: If you are insistent with doing all of the endings, and then do it again, it's because you want to experience it again.
-----
NeoZeedeater: No, it's not a requirement for the game to be good. Just do whatever works.
-----
Tigerfog: I think it's pretty safe to say that any game requiring tonal issues are a bad game. That is, a story for example, needs to have a tonal problem because it doesn't have enough exposition, or any other problem.
-----
OldSocksAndShoes: I would say to start with mass effect and then work your way up.
-----
BuddyDharma: The Suikoden series has tonal issues, but it's not a requirement.
-----
NinjaScooter: Absolutely not. There are tons of games out there that are tonal wrong in some way and are endings that are poorly told, or are ending systems so strict that they let you down.
-----
Tibarn: I would say to start with Dark Souls, as in, it has some interesting plot but everything is just bad in execution.

====================
~!~I don’t know what to say about the KH series. It’s a fantastic game. Hopefully more people play it.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I played the original release of Kingdom Hearts III a few years back and I honestly don’t know what to say about it. It’s a fantastic game. It’s flashy and fun to play. It’s the best Final Fantasy game. It’s the only mainline Final Fantasy game that isn’t technically Final Fantasy. It’s the only mainline game in a series where the overarching story is “the good life.” That’s it.
I recently saw a video or whatever where someone played a demo of KHIII for people who haven’t played the previous 2 games. I was intrigued by the story and gameplay as well as some of the worlds and characters that were given some screen time to shine.
I got to try out Kingdom Hearts: The World Ends With You and was rather shocked by how much I was enjoying it. It wasn’t revolutionary, it wasn’t revolutionary. But I still thought it was a fun experience that I would go back to for a few weeks or months.
I’m glad I did. I’m glad it didn’t feel stale or boring to play. It’s one of the best Final Fantasy games.
Now that I have finished Kingdom Hearts III, I just need to decide if I’m ready to play it or not.

xChildofhatex: I don't know if I get back to it, but I did play for about a week and a half after finishing the story. The gameplay was very nice, the story was very nice, and the gameplay was fun as hell. I'm not ready to go back to it, but I am sure I will come back once I'm done with it.

====================
~!~Please be aware: The "Tales of Xillia" is a paid expansion for Xillia 2

Krejlooc: I just found this tweet by the official forums. It contains alot of spoilers, so please be prepared to take some time to look it up.
The base game is on the Xenosaga Manga, which is a collection of scans and fan translations of the manga of Xillia, the story is in this form and is on pages 16-20. The translation of the manga is on this page, at the bottom. It is NOT the best one, but it is fine. In fact, one of the things that made me love this game is because of the translation.
But that's not what I wanted, and it's what I needed to understand about the story.
Spoiler: Xenosaga Manga Spoiler
The story itself is simple, but involving gods and teases. The beginning of the game is in this form, where you are, during the event of the story, you will fight the 13 gods and 14 villains in this world.
Spoiler: Xenosaga Manga Spoiler
It is during this time that you will meet Hotto, a legendary who will send you to fight them. The event is over, Hotto is willing to send you back to where you began, however, you have to beat the 13 gods. The 13 you begin with are gods you fought in the past, however, the 13 have changed, and now have their own plot twist, Hotto makes an effort to kill the old gods to gain more power. Because of this, the events that happen in this game are just slightly darker than the ones in the manga, and even though the story is simple, the twists and turns are still there. The "true" ending is where you get a god, beat up the 13, and get a twist on the gods.
Spoiler: Xenosaga Manga Spoiler
The boss fights in the game are really nice, and the boss fights are pretty well done. The writing overall is top notch, and the boss fights are great.
Spoiler: Xenosaga Manga Spoiler
The game is on sale right now to see if it is worth it. It goes up until Oct. 19, and it is on sale for all of the way up to Oct. 25.

====================
~!~LTTP: Resident Evil 7: Remake (SPOILERS UP)

theofficefan99: I always wanted to play this series, EVER. It's one of those games that actually made me tear up, that I've always wanted to play and finish.
I've still not gotten past the first mansion, and I'm not sure if I'm allowed to pull the trigger yet. I just wanted to see what people thought.
I played on Nightmare, the Nightmare version on Normal, but I was able to get through it with cheats once I got to the first, and I was able to get through it with high-speed cheats once I got to the second. I've heard that Nightmare also has a lot of graphical glitches, and that's not something you should have to worry about. I've had basically zero issues with the game (and it runs at a playable framerate, so it doesn't have to be that), and even when I tried it ran better than the regular version. But I understand there's a huge difference between the Nightmare version, and the Normal version.
There's no saving system, so I'm playing on Nightmare, but man, if I had to save between 30 and 60 bullets, that'd be the worst difficulty spike I've ever seen.
It's the first time I've gotten the urge to quit the game.
I'm playing on the lowest difficulty, Hard. It's manageable, but I never felt that way after I made my house a bit more creative.
I'm not terribly familiar with the RE engine, and I don't know what the hell they're planning. I just assumed it was made for the hardcore crowd, since I would be pretty used to the kind of gameplay and puzzles that the game provides.
Anyone know what RE7 is like? Can it run at 60fps?
Thanks.
-----
theofficefan99: I'm curious about how they're going to handle the graphical options.
-----
theofficefan99: here's an image of the graphics options
-----
theofficefan99: oh, another thing I noticed about the graphics is that there's no save or quit option - everyone who plays the game lose their save files

====================
~!~Where the hell is an actual official solution to the Sonic Adventure fans?

Scarecrow: The short answer is: Outer Space. It was a very small part of the Sonic team's DNA, and has stuck out to this day.
For the majority of those years between 06 and 08, the mainline games focused on story, and had Sonic Adventure in the lead. There was a number of spin-offs developed by Square, but Sonic Team were always the ones pushing the Adventure franchise forward. It's a relic of their earlier, more iterative, engine. It should have been one of the first three or four "classic" titles, but they're still alright.
SEGA Europe has been less than thrilled with the recent push for Adventure since the beginning. They're not known as a key staff within the company, and their titles are generally not top-tier action thrillers.
Now that they're finally making something, though, what are their plans?
SEGA Europe's, and Western developed studios, are slowly coming back into being. Nintendo and Sony took over the first spot, but Nintendo, and now Sony's, haven't been as successful in recent times.
SEGA isn't really interested in a Sonic styled adventure franchise. They're going for something a bit more "fresh", and I don't think a big classic title needs to be one of the first three or more.
So, what is the solution?
The main problem with Sonic Team is that they fell way short of what they should have been. They tried something called the Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed series, and it just didn't work out.
For the fanbase, it was their first Sonic game, and they were really disappointed. The fanbase was really annoyed with the lack of a satisfactory solution for Sonic.
There are Sonic Team internal projects, but their titles have been Sonic Team external projects, and they haven't been as successful. 
EA and Activision have been more than happy with their output this generation, they've been more than happy with the positive changes they've been making, and they've been more than happy with the positive changes in their franchises.
The problem is that the real good games are being produced by SE and developed by Western studios who're more than happy to take a stab at Adventure.

Camjo-Z: They don't need to be one of the first three or four titles.

~!~How many of you actually like to play the games you do?

SolVanderlyn: I'm not talking about how to play them, but how many of you actually enjoy them.
I was at a convention last week and someone brought a controller to help play the first one on the Xbox One. I felt like an out of nowhere superstar. I thought to myself that I would love to be able to pick and choose who I would play. I'd play through the games, the stories, and the banter between the people in charge. I was surprised to find that I actually had a community.
I've been playing and enjoying EVERY game I've been on.
But I feel like I've been missing out on a massive community of people who are the most passionate about the games I enjoy the most.
I know that there are a lot of games out there that you enjoy but they can't escape that itch. They can't escape boredom. They can't fathom the amount of detail and optimizations they need to pull them out of the stalemate. They can't stop enjoying the things they enjoy. They can't stop buying the things they love and dedicating themselves to them. They can't stop enjoying the story they have to tell themselves. 
But they can do it. 
I'm so fascinated by the things people like to do, I can't stop engaging with them. They are the ones I really value. They are the ones that change up everything for me. They are everywhere and they're so fun to run through. They're in my notebooks, in the activities I do, in the menus I open, in my own little ways in with the settings. They're so much fun.
I also have a similar feeling of being overwhelmed by the things I don't like. I can't stop playing. I can't stop playing. I'm doing it, but I'm struggling. It's like I'm so overwhelmed that I'm not even playing at all.
So what about you? How much of a community do you have? How many of you play games with people?

~!~LTTP: Kojima's Metal Gear Solid

Kaguya: I was watching a stream of a Japanese stream when I started watching it, thinking that Metal Gear Solid felt really cool, especially at a time where America was on its way to becoming a european monarchy.
I was surprised, then when the entire LGS crew started talking about it, to understand how great a game this was.
Holy shit this game was incredible. I felt like I had a 4th wall special encounter (that was amazing), then the entire game hit me with a tutorial segment, and it was magical, even more so seeing all the different ways the mechs worked.
The gameplay was great. The cutscenes (that were so well animated that they felt like they were playing in a movie, especially when you were doing them with the AI dog and the cinematics they were amazing. They knew how to make you feel right). The weapons. The animations. The way they exaggerated the gravity fields and combined them with such different animations.
It was like watching a Pixar movie in 3D. The animation here isn't the best, but I still love it and that was the only aspect that made it standout even more than FF 12 or FFVII. The way they connected you with the world through the use of the mechs and the way the way the soundtrack matched with the music was just magic.
The soundtrack was also the most creative they had, they used FF7 to shock the living crap out of FF7, paired it with the weather effects of the game and the way the weather effects made the character look "cool" (including the overuse of coolness in the outfit part) and combined it with the way the mechs reacted to the weather effects making the character look cool.
I didn't like the way the characters were designed, I didn't like the art style. But I did like the story and I'm glad they did what they did with the character designs.
But I can't help but feel like the video game industry, or at least the states are, is way ahead in letting players create their own characters, customize them, and do other things than going to a spritesheft.
I think it's crazy how much of the creative freedom they put into character creation and customization is locked behind a paywall.

butman: PS Now on the go costs much less than the Wii, PS4 games are expensive to boot and the PS2 classic is expensive to play.
The PS Now store page compared PS Now prices of the Wii to the PS3 store:
So how does PS Now compares?
Battery life
PS3 games costs an arm and a leg to play on a PS3.
-----
Lkr: Ps3 library is a brisk 60$ per month and the Wii was over 10 years ago.
-----
Kito: Wii is a much better value, yes. I spent around $30 for a copy on PS3 and it was worth it.
PS3 is an amazing combo of portability + controller support.
-----
BizzyBum: I think they're both worth your money, especially if you never owned a Wii.
Wii is a far faster, more powerful, and more feature complete, with better compatibility and compatibility with Wii U games.
PS3 is just better in terms of portability.
-----
Chaosblade: PS3 library is ridiculous. Wii was just a download with the download required to play it, PS3 is download with the game running and the game would just be downloadable on the PS3 with no additional download needed. PS3 also requires a cert to install the required game, which is only a few dollars more.
-----
TheRaidenPT: The Wii and PS3 are also faster and more capable than the Wii U. People are upset that the Wii u can't play Wii games or PS1 games. They're upset that the Wii U can't play classic PS games.
Wii is also more resistant to modding and compatibility patches.
PS3 is also more capable than Wii.
-----
Kito: Wii is also far faster, and the ability to play the Wii library with any controller is also better for you.
PS3 is also much faster, but it is a weaker system.
The PS3 is also expensive, and does not let you play PS1 and PS2 games.
Wii you can play it with any controller even.

I'm about ready to buy a lot of games this year and I'm not sure what's out of the backlog.

~!~How to make 3DS games for Switch?

Robinson: I have a 4DS, but I have a Switch and a 4K portable.
I love playing on the Switch, but I'm noticing that my Switch is having an issue. My games sometimes don't look or run like a traditional game, and sometimes the games don't look or run like a good game. For example, I'm playing Kirby Star Allies and I notice that it's missing the colorful colours of the 3DS games. I understand that the 3DS version has the same issues, but I can't help to feel that the 3DS version is missing out on a lot of great games.
Any tips would be appreciated. I'm just curious.
-----
Jucksalbe: The same goes for the 3DS and the rest of the system. Double Dash works great in Switch, and the music and visual details in the 3DS version are great.
-----
Aleh: If you don't mind portability, double dash and joycons are a must. Especially for NSMBU.
-----
Zalman: Buy Fire Emblem Awakening (the 3DS version)
-----
Noppie: It's a great port if you get your hands on it. I'd recommend it.
-----
NoKisum: Buy Fire Emblem Fates (Switch). The gameplay is great, the story is a nice surprise and there are a few good side missions.
-----
Nabbit: Yes, you can pick up the DS version for 30.99 USD. Just keep in mind that you will lose a lot of content to the Switch's homebrew.
-----
MaverickHunterX: 1. Get the latest version of the emulator (DXA), save data (save data), resolution (save data), mode (save data).
2. Profit, yes congrats
-----
hussien-11: I think that's the general advice of everyone I know that he recommends buying Fire Emblem Awakening.
1. Profit, yes congrats

~!~The Best Example of a Mobile Game can be Anything

The era of Luigi: E 3 D O N I S E N G E
First things first, this is not a thread to bash mobile games. This is not to say that everything is bad. I have no reason to feel ashamed when I play a mobile game. I just wanted to say that I feel ashamed about playing a game that I love, and I think any time I can do it, I can do it.
I want to put in but do not try to change that.
In the past, I had to work on my personal development and I think my development team was not ready to balance and optimize everything. But I think that now it is too late to change the way things are done and now we are done.
My point is that this is not a "mobile game" and is not a "mobile game only" game (apparently that's not what it means exactly).
In reality, in a game like this, you don't have to think about mobile. You can just look at the newest hotness.
And I'm not talking about speed. I'm talking about games that do not have to think about mobile.
This is a game that has to be played, even if you don't know what you are talking about.
-----
Acquiescence: Yakuza 0, Gran Turismo Sport and Mario and Luigi are some of my favourite mobile experiences. It's not even a question!
-----
The era of Luigi: I feel like the game industry as a whole needs to be more inclusive.
-----
TheRaidenPT: I'm glad more people are playing games
-----
TheRaidenPT: I hope a dev like ARK makes a mobile game with the name "Socom X Machina"
-----
lionhats: I don't think it's a "casualized" mobile game. It's more like one that is good fun.
-----
Tofer: I’m excited to play this game
-----
The era of Luigi: I agree with u
-----
TheRaidenPT: I think it's a good mobile game.
Gravity Rush and Mario and Luigi are perfect for mobile
-----
Lord of Ostia: I think it's a good experience. If the game industry can learn from ARK, this could be a fantastic avenue for improvement in the
====================
~!~Would you buy a Switch port for the first time if it works as intended?

TheIdiot: I'm aware that the original version of the game was a bit of a mess, and there's no way to play it normally (except for one time fights), but I'd be down for it.
So basically the idea is to have like a portable version of the game that's still playable, but you can't play it on the TV or in a portable.
I don't see an ideal way to do it, but I think it'd be a nice touch.
-----
Hippopuncher12: Yes, I would buy it again.
-----
CormoranStrike: Yes, why would I?
-----
kvetcha: If I had to guess, I would assume that it would be something Nintendo would be more keen to support with their games.
-----
King Dodongo: Hell yes.
-----
ILikeFeet: If there are enough portable users, probably. Wouldn't be too hard to convince some to try the game, but I imagine it wouldn't be so widely embraced that it would needlessly complicate the design.
-----
Mr. Phellps: Not at all. I would not be surprised if a version of the game that was more in the vein of the Wii U port has a significantly higher resolution on the Wii U version.
-----
delete12345: Yes, that is the correct answer.

~!~It's been 3 years since the original RE2 Remake was released

TheRedSnifit: It's still the most played Resident Evil game in terms of players.
You have no idea how long it took to get there, but it's probably 8h.
-----
Kyoufu: I've got this game still waiting to be played for years.
-----
CaviarMeths: It's still one of my top RE games. It's still the best. The original is still excellent.
-----
spindashing: The original release has yet to disappoint.
-----
TheRedSnifit: I absolutely agree, especially the music.
-----
KZXcellent: It's still the primary game for me.
-----
Scotia: I really, really like it.
-----
NoKisum: I think that's a fair description.

TheRedSnifit: I mean, in general. Resident Evil is really the evolution of Resident Evil movies.

Manu: That's a good summary.

====================
~!~I'm having a hard time playing the Star Ocean remaster on the PS4

Soundtrack2chaos: I already played the original Star Ocean, which is one of the best games there is, I am on my second play through, this game is atrocious. I am not sold on the game as it is, but I sort of want to play it again. I am interested in hearing people's opinions, is it worth playing? I am trying to figure out what is going on with the game and I'm interested in hearing if it is worth playing or not.
I have played all the other Star Ocean games, but I only have a PS3 and PSVita. I am mainly looking forward to playing it on the PS5, but I have the PS4 version of the original Star Ocean waiting to be played as well.
-----
Funyarinpa: Not really, but I've always been interested in it. I had the original on my PSP and had no idea what this game was, and even though I've been playing for the last month, I haven't touched it again. It's a very emotional and beautiful game, but I'm not sure if I want to play it again.
-----
Kazura: I played it on PSP and thought it looked very nice, even the music it's great. I think it's an okay game but not worth playing for the story.
-----
Jawmuncher: Yes. I was a little skeptical, but the few times I've tried out the original I've only had the story for like a half hour. 
I think it's worth a play through. Story is a bit "simpler" since you basically go through the motions. But I think the gameplay is really good and it's a pretty relaxing experience.
-----
FiXalaS: I thought it was a cute game but I wasn't feeling it.
I'll wait for a sale.
-----
Crayon: I didn't care, I'm just busy I guess.
-----
Funyarinpa: I would have said that. I don't recall being disappointed either, personally.
-----
Ascheroth: I'm busy, but I'm also busy as hell. I'll have more time for playing this on the weekend.
-----
Ascheroth: I've seen discussions about the game in the Yakuza thread.

~!~The Quiet Man, a detective game by SETI Media, releases this summer for PC

Maxime: 
-----
GavinUK86: I'll need to get this game. It looks pretty interesting.
-----
the_wart: Wow, that's some low key pickings. This sounds like something I'd be interested in.
-----
SaberX85: Looks good. I will install it to check character lenghts
-----
Hektor: "This game has a solitary mission"
Is that accurate?
-----
Maxime: I played it a while back, it's a prequel that takes place sometime after Human Revolution:
It's very clear that the game is set prior to Human Revolution in a manner entirely different to what the author considers "the novel" (p. 229). The term "slice of life" is used to describe games that are a slice of life as much as possible, and it's up to players to stretch the canon to their heart's content. The game will eschew "slice of life" as it's essentially a "spice of ideas" game design, opting for slice of life to define the character and his/her relationships.
The game is very much a prequel, but it's still very much a slice of life game, in a sense. The game's mission is to explore human interactions and some of humanity's most complex concepts, and the outcome of those interactions determine not only the character's fate, but the entire humanity, and the fate of anything associated with it.
Original Prototype 2 is a fusion between slice-of-life and slice-of-life (slice-of-life) games. It's a fusion that combines design concepts between (1) slice-of-life games (slice-of-life) games and (2) films. The game will be designed by the following three people: Bernard Weiss (Director and Guy Wai, writer), Hideo Shinkawa (Art Director and Masahiro Ito (Producer) and Kosuke Uchiura (Composer) from the original The Quiet Man), Takeshi Yanase (Vagrant Story writer), Takayuki Sugiyama (Composer) and Takeshi Yanase (Sketch Artist and former writer).
The first game is a very personal and very interesting story that you will never know.
The second game is a

~!~The Jimquisition - No thanks. The truth is on the way

Aokiji: I’m in the middle of trying to finish God of War, and I’m about to listen to a GotY talkhow. But man, I’m not getting hyped. I’m not going to pay the $100 bucks for a CD-ROM drive. I’m not going to pay for an online subscription. I’m not going to wait until my system can play everything I play. I’m not going to go back to systems I bought and sold years ago. I’m not going to wait until a new system can play the shit I played.
Here’s what Jim had to say:
Currently, I have a PS4 Pro and a Switch. We are already in the “Summer of PS5”. I’m waiting for the next PSX in Tokyo, but we have to wait for a long time. Sony, you want me to buy my next console? Please don’t. I have a whole backlog of systems, but Sony is holding us off until we start to get some great games again.
Sony is completely right. PS5 is a Sony product. Please, hold on to your backlog.
-----
Memento: No thanks, people
-----
Toumari: I agree.
-----
Memento: I agree with him. 
I mean, he is just a gamer. It is not a job, it is an hobby. And it is not like a career, it is a life. And it is not a company that can afford to keep people employedon a consistent basis. I am not saying you need to work for Sony, you are not going to work for Microsoft. But you can have your job and hobby aboard, and it is a hobby.
-----
N.Domixis: I think he’s right. No one. There was a “mystery” at PlayStation Japan about the PS5. It was a certain retailer, but when they got the clearance, they wanted to use it to refurbish the console. They figured there was no financial risk. They didn’t pass up the deal.

~!~Splatoon 2's Splatfest - announced. 28/11 - 28:00 UTC (PST)

Atheerios: Nintendo has revealed the upcoming Splatoon 2's stage:
It is a mix of tropical forest, river-swimming squidids, water splatting octopuses and a giant caterpillar.
It has a unique music and sounds as expected, while the squid-thingy plays on the music and sounds with the music of the game. You can choose to get your tickets or not, but you can't change the stage until then.
The ticket system activates your chance to win. You need to get 1 point every 30 minutes or so.
There's also a shop to buy ink ribbons. If you'd rather wait, the stage will be open to everyone during the day and the squid-thingy will also come up with special ink ribbons that represent their abilities in the shop.
It also has a unique boss to defeat.
The ink ribbon system was inspired by the first game.

Piscus: I love the ink ribbons.

Brazil: I’m all in! Can’t wait to break out my 3rd pair of emergency storage tanks.

Cronogear: I've always wanted to get into this game, but I've never done so before.
-----
Masterspeed: I don't mind it, but I was prepared to be arsed to do *something* so loud.
-----
Cartridge Games: It’s a bit “crr** odd” that it’s raining outside and the rain looks pouring.
Hope the cloud system’s effect is gone, but it’s nice to get some visibility on stuff like this.
-----
Atheerios: You'll be able to change the time of day and weather in the shop during the day and night. You don't lose your ticket, but you lose your spot to receive it.
-----
Z-Beat: This is awesome. I wonder if they'll keep it going?
-----
foxuzamaki: Awesome, i guess now we can stop worrying about ticket issues

~!~Assassin's Creed Odyssey: what do you think?

Much: First of all let me start by saying I have never played an Assassin's Creed game before. I did however play Assassin's Creed 2, 3, Revelations, Black Flag, Black Flag 2, Black Flag Warmaster, Black Flag Complete Edition and III, I believe these all got Far Cry New Dawn. I believe these all got Far Cry 5 and Crysis 2.
I am playing on Hard and I think I would recommend it to beginners as the game is not as hard as the classic games and there are no turns which is a bit limiting. I do not know if I will like this as I was expecting something really hard, I have played games like COD and MW more and it is really frustrating.
Now to the question.
I have always enjoyed playing Assassin's Creed and I am hesitant to start new games as there are certain things that I find hard. I have played in order of release and there have been some titles I have found difficult.
I have tried a few times to get into the series but the last one I did was Ezio. I did not like the gameplay of it, I expected something very hard and it was very hard.
This time I have decided to keep playing it, I have tried every challenge set throughout the game. I have done:
Combat
I have tried using stealth takedowns during missions. I have used stealth takedowns as much as I could possibly get, but it doesn't seem to work for this game. It is a really dangerous game and you can do so, but there is a fear that you will do more damage to the enemy than you should if you use it correctly. Therefore, I have used stealth takedowns as much as I can. This is a mistake that I have apologized for and I feel like it is going to hurt the game in the long run.
Story
I have used stealth takedowns as early as possible. I have used stealth takedowns as early as I can. This is a mistake that I have apologized for and I feel like it is going to injure my game in the long run.
I have tried reading a lot about what is going to happen in this game, especially in the later chapters and some of the chapters that the game scales to max difficulty easily. I have read that the game is about the story and I am not ready yet to jump in.
I have tried
====================
~!~If you could only play one game a year, which one would it be?

Araujo: I mean, all games are welcome... but, what about all games?
Most of us kind of want to have fun and play some fun together. When we are playing one we basically have to choose what we want to do next. I am not making this thread for the sake of arguments or anything, i just want to be sure we are giving enough thought and providing some good games and fun together. 
An example is a recent thread announcing a new LucasArts game.
Now, someone told me that Dark Cloud was a good game, but not the best one. Now, I have played all of these Dark Cloud games, but not from the best place because I just wanted to chill and relax.
Another example is my choice of my own "main" party in Kingdom Hearts 1. I came to enjoy the Disney magic, but I wanted to play as everyone. It was like playing a fantasy RPG (I am a hero).
Honestly, i have a weird problem where i'm playing a game and done and now it's time for the main party to be back in it. For instance, I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix and got to a point where i was bored to tears with the main party.
In Kingdom Hearts 1, the main character, Iris, was a little bit too much for me and the loop of her being a total princess, only to get someone who she loves, no matter what. Often, my party would be literally on their asses because they are literally just sitting out the door, only to be tripped into a scenario where my main party is actually dead and I have to drag them out...
In Kingdom Hearts 2. This happens in the Chain of Memories but that is more or less equivperitivey because the ending is in fact bittersweet. I was a happy party member whose only purpose was to protect the princesses, and it was neigh on every screen that there was a princess in that castle. But then the ending happened and... Iris and Stella are now back together, only to find out that she is actually just a depressed falcon (not sure if falcon is the right term for the name) and the two have a falling out...
I just don't know where this idea came from. I could understand this loop of events, but why is it not in the
====================
~!~How do you feel about the next DEATH BATTLE... (Spoilers/End Game spoilers)

TheGamingNewsGuy: So it's been a long time since we had a reveal like this, but apparently the DEATH BATTLE is going to be a game about Thanos.
Some of you may remember that the first thing we saw was the Mastermind/Revelator build of the Guardians when they visited Guardians. (I think it was a teaser) We then saw the Guardians and Thanos and now we're seeing the Mastermind in Guardians and Thanos.
As for the DEATH BATTLE itself, it felt like a great idea. It would be a 3v3 kind of fight with Thanos, but with Thanos having a shield and a rocket launcher, there's a lot of cool stuff to be found in this battle. The team had a lot of fun playing together and the arena was a lot of fun to go to in co-op. The concept for the fight was great and I liked how they used the same tech from Guardians of the Galaxy, but a lot of it was a mix of different things, like deflecting Laser Tag and other special moves.
The idea was to use the Defenders as rallying points for the fight against the Thanos that had been plaguing the Guardians for years. The best way to fight these enemies was to use a combination of the jump button and the grab attack. Here's a video showing it in action:
The energy sword and the bee spell were pretty fun to use, though the energy sword was pretty broken in the game. I personally always found it pretty easy to abuse in the end, though it is still a heck of a lot to use.
I really liked how they were able to figure out the telekinesis powers from the fragments and used those as a great excuse for the teammates to do things together. It was a nice mix of the abilities the fragment/beam/dodge and the break tech 
Basically the end game was going to be about going on a suicide mission against Thanos, and not having a plan for it. I actually liked the way they used the fragments to stop his violence and the break tech and the break was pretty neat.
My biggest complaint about the game was how little stuff was shown, most of it was just cut out text and solutions to puzzles. There was some semblance of banter between the members, but we only

That being said, I can't help but think that Smash Ultimate could solve all my issues about Smash as a franchise.

~!~I think I finally understand the lies about the Switch being sexy

The Great Khali: I think it's time we changed the status of the Switch.
Let's start with the most hot stuff:
The screen getting bigger and bigger.
The joycons expanding.
The butt-grabber that doesn't physically touch the dock.
And the "hotness" of the screen being bigger and bigger.
This is part of what I call the Switch family. A bubblegisterial family. They are the ones who believe you can not get away with anything if you don't get them. They believe they are invincible and if they keep getting bigger and bigger, they will keep getting the fun. They are invincible because they are the one who makes the switch. They are invincible because they can not get away with anything.
Now, I have to admit, I completely understand this. I think people like tight, sexy gaming and this is no different. 
But I don't think I am actually the only one. I think the Switch family have a few of the more "tight" ones. 
The girl who says that the touchpad is the best one (I think she is the only one) is absolutely correct. 
The guy who says that the touchscreen is "boring" is pretty wrong too. 
But I think you will eventually learn why I think this. 
First of all, I have no idea if this is true or not. I don't think I can use my switch in public. I don't think it is sexy. I don't know what it is but the fact that it is a new product is a good one. 
But the second thing is. I have no idea what this family is talking about. I am going to skip this color day and get a regular model. 
How do you guys think this could effect your enjoyment?
-----
Fat4all: my butt gets waxed
-----
TrickyAssist: The weirdest thing about this is that the Switch "smells" exactly as you put it onto the screen. So it's literally not sexy.
-----
DanteLinkX: Lemme just pretend it's not sexy until I see this.

~!~What are the chances of a First-Person Title with a Major Role?

TheGift: I'm talking about a game that would have a major role in a game like a AAA film or a TV show. What do you guys think it would be like to have a title that would play a pivotal role in a game? 
For me personally I think a major role for Joel would be one of the main characters in the movie. Would be an interesting player to play with and a new character that would help out the movie plot. I know it wouldn't be a big deal but I think it would sell a ton. 
Others I can think of are Tony Hardy in Game Of Thrones, Summer Glitch in Resident Evil, etc.
-----
Parenegade: Tony Hardy is in Ready Player One.
-----
Mr.Peanutbutter: I think it would be a big deal. It would be a major character in the very beginning of the movie. It would be a new antagonist that might have some playing as segments in between the two story beats. The possibility of a good main character in a AAA film just screams night, I wonder if they could pull it off?
-----
TheGift: I would love a Tony Hawk title.
-----
neon_dream: Tony Hardy was in Ready Player One.
-----
Aokiji: a Tony hmmm.. I’m not sure if I’ll wait. I mean I think the movie is coming out next year but I could see it being a pretty busy year for a game.
-----
Cantplayer: Tony would be the main character of a Spiderman movie.
-----
TheGift: Yeah, I think you might be right. I mean I think it would sell a ton. I know a lot of folks have been asking for Tony Hawk to get a little bit of role especially with Avengers. Tony Hawk is a big brand with a lot of stars in Hollywood. I think if the game has a big, good character that has a lot of backstory and touches up to Spider-Man it could work. If not the game is selling a lot if it isn’t a well done main character.
-----
Cantaim: I don't think Tony Hawk would win me over if I played as MJ.

~!~So what happened to the Ninja Gaiden series?

King of Dreamland: Was just playing Ninja Gaiden Black, and it really hit me. The story was intriguing, the story was interesting, the characters were good, and it all felt great when I finished it. Now, I know it got a little undercooked, but I feel like the series’ focus on the ninja genre really went downhill in the final arc, and I feel like Ninja Gaiden 4 is the last installment in the series.
And now, I’m coming back to the series, and it’s hit me like a ton of heat I dropped on it before it got any good traction. 
I remember the first NG3 being a lot of fun back when it first released, and I played it religiously for a long time.... but after NG2, and after that until 2 and Ninja Gaiden Sigma, it hit me hard with NG3. There wasn’t a lot of story to it. I only played about 1 hour a day for about a year, and then I stopped playing. I don’t think I ever went back to it. 
When I finally got into it, it hit a point where I just wasn’t interested. I heard it had a story mode, and honestly thought it was a bad ATB system. Was I wrong? Was the story poor? Was the gameplay bad? Was my interest bad?
I’m still amazed I finally got to play through all of these games, but I just wanted to talk about them and see if it’s something worth keeping in mind.
-----
ryushe: I think you're gonna have a hard time remembering the last game in the series. The Ninja Gaiden games are amazing.

i can only speak of its atmosphere, and the music. in my playthrough of the game, i actually didn't have a problem with the ambient noises and music, but i found it to be a bit subdued. the last few moments were cool, but the last few tracks were annoying. one of the worst tracks in the game, because it kinda made you feel like the characters are just dying, but it kinda made it a bit more exciting... and the ending... i love the atmosphere of this game, it's quite emotional for me. i really like the music, and the story... i didn't like the story of the first game, and this was the last time it actually got me excited about the game. it was also not the best of choices for the game, because it went from average to bad (i mean the first game has much better enemy design and pacing but the second one was just bad), but i still liked it.
so far i'm having a blast with it, and i actually like the atmosphere of the game. more so than the first game, it's actually really tense and scary... but it's not too long, it's actually tense to play on short sessions
i'm currently in the middle of the game, so i can't pinpoint when exactly, but it's kinda close by the watermark on the right side of the map, and i don't have the advantage of moving the mouse, i'm kinda stuck at that point in the game
anyway, yay, i finished the game!
-----
Lux86: The first was soo much fun, so far was more playing alone than in a group. The 2nd one was ok but nothing special.
-----
Hate: I think RE7 is the best and most chilling Resident Evil game.
The atmosphere is pure terror, as you are now.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i fucking loved that first one, the atmosphere was so fucking good. really enjoyed the second one and will play both.
-----
Clocian: One of my favorite horror games, and the only one that is actually terrifying for me. So glad you enjoyed it OP.

~!~Let's talk about E3/Game Awards contenders

marzoo: So for those who don't know what E3 is, it's the event that awards games, tv shows and movies.
The awards are usually the presenting of the games that have been announced for the year.
My question is: what are the best E3 time of the all together? 
I think it's the time of the year where many games are announced, there is talk about them on era, I think many people forget about the Last of Us 2, Cyberpunk 2077 etc.
So my question is: what are the best time of the gaming awards?
-----
icespide: The time of the year is split between big titles and smaller stuff. Got to talk about it on ERA
-----
dmaul1114: Nominees are hard to figure out, but I think it's time for a mix of categories (how do you organize them)
Best Direction/Breakdown - Sekiro, Death Stranding, Resident Evil 2 Remake (which you listed, it could be a combination of any 2D/PS4 title, it would be great to see RE2 in this direct)
Best Intro/Rewind - KH3, Spiderman, The Last of Us 2 (this one was a surprise but I hope they improve on it)
Best Ending - MGS 5, MGSV, RE2
Best Audio Design - TLOU2
Best Performance - Witcher 3(this one was a big surprise but I hope they improve on it)
Best Cinematic Performance - AC: Odyssey
Best Performance at E3 - Smash Up
Best VR Performance - Robo Recall

-----
Kenzodielocke: Well, i think the time of the show is split between E3 and E3.

~!~The Wii's success in the UK helped convince Nintendo to release more of its software in the UK

BAD: I don't have prices for the games yet but I'm glad it's doing well. 
I think it's a little surprising given Nintendo's focus on handhelds, and that Wii was their last console. 
I was surprised at Nintendo's lack of availability for the Wii U, which they shuttered.
Nintendo's grip on the UK market has really made it a weak platform for Nintendo in the UK. 
UK retail is pretty bad overall for Nintendo games. 
The Wii U was their last console, so the UK is not going to see the sales of the Wii ever again. 
The Switch's lack of availability has made it a very underestimated sales success for Nintendo in the UK. 
Nintendo is on course to lose in the general public, but I think it's important to note that the UK public is not really interested in this industry. 
UK retail was not a huge in the early Wii days but Nintendo's kind of focus for the Wii really developed the UK market around here, they can take a look at some of the games available. 
The UK is going to be Nintendo's biggest market next time. 
It's quite a big undertaking to produce software in the UK, mainly because of the size of it. 
The Wii was a relatively new product and the distribution was not very good. 
The lack of availability has made it a very underestimated sales success for Nintendo in the UK. 
It's a shame because we're a pretty big country. 
I'm very curious how Nintendo will approach these kind of demographic concerns. Hopefully this DLC sells well and Nintendo gets the pre-order program off the ground.
-----
Kolx: At least in the UK they'll still make a few more million to offset the loss.
-----
Kenzodielocke: They‘re just trying to screw over people with bad internet.
-----
Cartridge Games: The Wii ended up being almost a decade old.
If the Wii U can‘t sell on Switch, it probably can‘cancel it.
They might be able to make a big enough profit off Wii in another couple of years

Platy: ...they are not doomed ?
Yes, they will do well, but the Wii is the prototype for

~!~What are your expectations for the Castlevania Collection?

ItWasMeantToBe19: The upcoming Castlevania game by Retro and Bluepoint Games looks to be a huge success. However, with the upcoming Castlevania Collection featuring the rumored Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man 11, a lot of people on Era are wondering what their actual expectations are with it.
For me it looks like Retro will be the first studio to bother with a return to classic Castlevania and classic Mega Man format with all the DLC available. I expect that the collection will contain 30 Castlevania and Mega Man games with all the DLC included.
I think the result will be a Castlevania game with many of the classic 3D Castlevania games, but with all the DLC included. I also think they will be pretty tight with the formula and story. I know some people on Era have said that Mega Man 11 is not necessary to get the full series, but that is as far as I can remember with the last 30 Castlevania games.
So what do you guys think?
-----
Silky: Konami should make a Lords of Shadow game
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: The castlevania IP should be dead
-----
Jawmuncher: I feel like I’d be more excited for a new Castlevania.
-----
Dascu: I'd be more interested if the game came out this year.
If not, I'd be more interested in a Lords of Shadow.
-----
Aters: I would be excited for a game with the best style ever seen in a game. A huge Castlevania Universe, everyone needs to play Lords of Shadow, damn.
-----
Cess007: I mean, this is all hypothetical. I think it is possible if the series sells 10M units.
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: Yeah, but I believe that the game will be released in 2019.
-----
Christo750: The best game in the series, IMO. 
It needs a lot more DLC and content.
-----
Aadiboy: This is actually a good post.
I like the characters and the music and the atmosphere. But the gameplay, while good, was still not as satisfying as the classic series.

~!~Is the "Stream my Next Console" a viable option for streaming strategy?

Booker.DeWitt: Era,
I am watching a Masterclass on Video Games and I am Hearing that the "Stream My Next Console" strategy is one that is very viable for the future of Consoles. 
I am thinking, that maybe people can do a lot better than streaming their games to a PC, and maybe even get more freedom in terms of hardware, but I am also wondering, is this a viable option for the future of consoles?
I am also thinking about this, but I am not sure which is a realistic option.
I am trying to figure out if this is a viable option for the future of Consoles, or if this is a strategy for the future of consoles.
-----
LewieP: I think you're pretty much on your own if you consider the "Stream Your Next Console" strategy.
-----
Svart: I think its already a viable option.
-----
Flux: It's already a viable option.
-----
Mazzle: It is, but not by making it.
I think they are cleverly using the fact that they already offer a "streaming only" solution:
Streaming only streaming solution.
Streaming in general
-----
Gowans: I was thinking of this, I’ve had a PS4 for awhile and a Switch since day 1.
I can’t see myself using this as primary option, not at least not until it's something cheaper, I really don’t want the Switch to be a secondary console to me.
I think the best option is to just do it for now, the PS4 and potentially the Xbox could use it as well, but then again I know its not feasible and would have to be extremely heavy handed to do so.
-----
Windu: I think you're wrong. I don't think it's going to be viable at this point.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think you're on your own judging only from a technical point of view. No one is suggesting that they make it a Consoles vs Console battle, and they are both wrong.
-----
CaviarMeths: I don't think streaming will be a viable option for the next generation of consoles. Especially when you consider the future of game streaming services.

Chaz: More at the link
-----
marzoo: I'm interested in this game but i'm not sure what the game protag should be like.
-----
Theorry: Idk what the main character should be like. I think she should be like Drake because he got destroyed at the end of the first game. I dont think she should be like a normal protag. She should be an adventurer in the world. And this will be out next Friday.
-----
DrBo42: I think the main character should be as special as she can be.
-----
Chaz: Yup, I think she will be special and different enough to care about, but also kinda unique.
-----
Pottuvoi: I don't think she should be special. She should be a normal warrior/paladin who will go on adventures.
-----
daniel77733: I like the concept of the protag role. It doesn't have the same "epic" feel that the character role offers.
-----
Chaz: I could give up for a third person shooter game with that kind of protagonist.

~!~Phil Spencer and Xbox Phil Spencer: "We’re going to do well, we’re going to have a good time"

christocolus: Another year, another record year for Xbox, and again it's nothing new, but the guy did surprisingly great job after taking over the job in 2014.
He's talked about this a bit here lately, but I felt it was important to highlight again why he's actually the head of Xbox. He's talked about this a bit here at E3 once again, and he's doing a job that was previously said to be "we're going to have a good time", and we don't know when we'll see Phil Spencer in the fall.
He's talked about this in the past multiple times, the job posting is now a job open, and job opening is right up the road for new studios to be opened if they want to get into the gaming industry.
He specifically says that he wants to make sure that we're going to have a great time, we're going to have a good time, we're going to have a very diverse gaming team, and we're going to have a very dynamic community that we're going to have cross periods where we're going to want to do well and maintain those good reviews, and we're going to want to be able to support ourselves on things that matter.
He goes on to talk about what new studios will bring in, and more specifically on how they're going to help us to stay in the game right.
Again, he specifically talks about how he's going to be making sure that new studios are fully focused on making games, and that we're going to continue to do that, and we're going to continue to get better and better at making games.
And then just in a momentary reaction below, we see him speaking about Xbox.
This is a major turning point for many people. Microsoft has been on a roll recently, they're on sale, they're enjoying the great games that they're bringing in, they're pushing Game Pass, they're supporting new IPs and initiatives like Game Pass. It just seems like it's becoming really obvious to me that they're going to do well.
So what do you all think about this?
-----
Linus815: I'm in, I'm glad to see Phil doing what he wants to do. I'm sure he will be a great President/CEO.

~!~XCOM-like game 'Long War' announced for PS4

Sibersk Esto: If you didn't know by name, XCOM-like is a pretty big name in Japanese games. It's a military-simulation game first released on PS1, later on 360 and then PS3. It's made by Firaxis Entertainment and is the spiritual successor to Xcom.
No word on a console version yet.

Ryo Hazuki: Nice! I hope this comes to the West. I want to play the series but I'm probably just waiting for a western release.

Tecnniqe: Not sure I'll buy it for myself but I love the setting and the premise.
I've been waiting for the series to come back. I really need to play XCOM-like :D
-----
Sibersk Esto: It's a great series. Huge fan of the series.
-----
Ryo Hazuki: Awesome! Been wanting to play the X-COM games lately, something like this would fit the bill.
-----
Tecnniqe: I'm really waiting for the GBA translation. I know it's been a while but I'd like to get something familiar to play again.
-----
Sibersk Esto: What is the name of the game? XCOM-like?
-----
Tecnniqe: It's a new XCOM-like game by Firaxis that's trying to bring back the roots of Xcom with a new focus on tactical combat. It's probably not ready for launch but it's set in a GBA world.
-----
Tecnniqe: Actually you could say it's XCOM-like. But you could probably say it's not XCOM-like.

~!~BTA's Evolved: How the game progressed from launch to more recent release (READ OP)

TheGamingNewsGuy: MOD EDIT: Farewell ERA !
For anyone who don't know what the BTA is, it's a game initially made in 2015 that first came to mind. It is an open world, first person shooter with a very light story and is very similar to Bioshock and Bioshock 2, with a goal to revitalize and modernize it in order to fight back after all these years. The game is open world multiplayer and is similar to Bioshock, but it is completely single player and basically a survival game. The main difference is that you can have any character you want, the game will give you one to choose from and you will have to resubmit to another character to complete the challenge. You can then trade that character back if you like.
Farewell ERA !
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Is this game going to be a long game or is it a standalone game at this point?
-----
KZXcellent: I definitely recommend checking out the wiki to find out more about the game. The game is massive and you'll love it.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: True, but I really dislike the story in the game as I feel that it is taking place in the 1800s and it's not a personal decision on who built it or what it's about. Just like in Bioshock you're not really killing all the dinosaurs in this game but you can also resurrecting all the dead.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: You should definitely try to read the wiki to see how the game is structured and how it's for everyone

~!~What are some of the best examples of a single player experience in a non-interactive game?

ToddBonzalez: One of the reasons I love playing as a character in a video game is the moment-to-moment experience of doing the sidequests. Some are so good, some are just mind-blowing. 
My question is, what are some other examples of this?
-----
Lant_War: This is cheating
-----
Richter1887: The Witcher 3 was always a very immersive open world.
-----
Trace: Bloodborne.
The side quests were great and some of them really introduced mechanics that made you feel like you were being fully immersed.
-----
Treasure Silvergun: The Witcher 2 and Half Life 2 are both amazing in how immersive they can be. 
Haven't played Horizon yet, but I know it has a few of these games in it, but it's not a non-interactive open world game.
-----
TheRedSnifit: I like to see how the side quests were done.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I know what you mean. Uncharted 4 was an immersive experience but Souls games don’t really get it. I mean, it’s a lot like watching a movie, but the first time you go to that movie is half the time.
-----
Memento: The Witcher 3
-----
ghibli99: Halo 2 was definitely one. The first half of the entire Covenant campaign is so immersive after the Hunter, but then you get that sense of his/herself again the whole time, and you can tell he is in a new mood.

~!~Why is the Switch Dock not bigger?

Nuclear Muffin: Saw this video on the Nintendo Switch subreddit from a user called “MrNonsense” (who can only be described as a Contra, who only ever uses his real name as well as his post on the subreddit) - where a user explains the reason why the Switch dock is not bigger...
The video goes into detail about the prototyping process of the design, and the various tools that are used to programmable bit boards and how each of them works. They then explain why they chose the “perfect size” for the Switch compared to the other models, and why the Switch supports a wide range of dac, resistors and CMOS that the other versions cannot. They then go on to explain why they chose the bigger size because they felt it was more “undeserving” of the other two.
What I found interesting about this is that they explained why they didn’t use a bigger PCB that the other versions use. The explanation for this was that they thought it was more “undeserving” having the bigger PCB because there were a lot of resistors and other pieces in between the bit boards that were in the prototypes.
Compare this to the Switch’s original version, which supports resistors between the console and PC bits boards.
Again, it’s in comparison video only, but they went with the bigger PCB because it was clearly more “undeserving” in the final product compared to the other versions.
(and the actual design of the PCB is clearly different, but in comparison video it is clearly more “ground up”, and is more difficult to remove so they went in lengths to remove it from the original version. Compare that with the Switch’s final version, which supports resistors between the PC and PC bits boards. And finally - they explained what exactly is used for the PCB in this video, and explain that uses different “reversible element” that protectors the bit boards. And they then went on to explain how that actually makes the PCB so “perfect”, and explain why that exact same pic uses different elements to protect the bit boards. And explain why this exact same pic still feels good when held in place. Now that this is the reason why Switch controllers feel “perfect” in comparison with the Switch, why does

~!~Gaming Meet-Ups, Most Haul Recommendations, and More

Mercenary09: Gaming jokes, puns, and puns have come a long way and it's been a topic of discussion here. But I thought it would be good to get Era in the know of gaming jokes/jokes, genres they enjoy, and other interesting recommendations for you to share.
I'll start it off with one I love, that's a JRPG that gets scaled back quite a bit but still manages to have its own identity by having its own unique identity and style while still maintaining it's own distinct identity and style of writing.
My Gaming Jokes:
I think the most fun one is The Legend of Zelda:
I don't think it's derogatory, but I really think it's a really fun one that doesn't take itself seriously. It's a game that has a ton of history and still has its own identity while having a lot of memorable moments. I love the slow build-up, the twists, the execution, and the impact of the story scenes.
I'd also like to know the best way to play the game, and what the consensus is for its types of gameplay. I've started with a PS2 Classic but never really got into the series until the 3DS port happened. I thought the gameplay and visuals were superb and it wouldn't be hard to pick a game that does the same.
-----
hydrophilic attack: I love boss fights in all video games, and the ones that I hate are the ones that don't respect the developer or the creators work.
boss fights in games are usually the most fun. they're great to watch as they occur.
-----
LightEntite: I hate boss fights, I hate anything that feels "cinematic" or feels "handheld"
others dont matter much either, I just dont care about them
-----
RochHoch: The Legend of Zelda is one of my favorites, so I don't know if it's the best one (if you mean the one before), but it's certainly up there.
It's a shame we haven't gotten Zelda RPGs that are as good or better than Breath of the Wild and Wild 2.

Ultimadrago: I hate some of the boss fights in Mario Odyssey. They feel...crude? They have me scratching my head everytime I see one. They also make

Looks like a pretty great deal, considering it's a cost effective option for me.

c0de: That's neat, but I don't like to pay more than $20 for this, so the only way I'd get a good wireless solution is to buy a good cable.

Sonicfan059: I’m glad I didn’t buy one either. I’m not a gamer.

SweetVermouth: I thought they were supposed to be included with the cable package. The VSW is pretty good to use for cable gaming is good to use with a cable. 
I assume it's still possible to use the cable box to improve the performance without the cables though?

~!~Times when you have a new relationship

Poutine Runner 2049: I've been wanting to share this with the world through my new relationship, but I've been avoiding most games for the past few years.
I remember seeing a game called chess match for the first time in high school. I had just watched a movie and was super confused as to why I was missing an important game. I quickly explained my situation and everything happened so quickly that I was speechless and couldn't understand the game or why I was missing.
It was a beautiful scene and I'm so happy that I'm finally able to share that with the world.
What about you? Are there times when you've experienced a new relationship that you'd rather not remember but love because at the time you had no idea what you were missing?

~!~The PlayStation 2 (1991) feels like a mid-2000s SNES or GameCube to me

SolVanderlyn: This is a thread by me, a long-time Playstation 2 fan, and the person who spent much of his early years playing consoles at a younger age.
I recently bought a PS2 for my own personal reasons.
To do so I needed something cool. I wanted something that I could play on my PS2 with good controls and buttons (I was a PC kid growing up).
I landed on the PlayStation 2.
It was, for lack of a better word, an awkward machine at the time, with low Input latency. It was a low input latency mess, to be fair. Yet, it worked.
The thing for me was a nice handheld system, and it was that. I had a PSP, my first console, and a Wii, but these were the early years of the Nintendo 3DS.
I don't know what it is with the PlayStation 2. It's a very weird machine.
I know it was expensive and flawed at the time, but it worked for a reason. I didn't have anywhere near as many consoles as previous ones.
It wasn't a home console with a big power setup. It was a handheld, a handheld with a big battery.
The rechargeable battery didn't last long. The stick thingers had to be recharged every few years. Sony did a lot with the battery before making the next iteration.
The system was also surprisingly loud.
The build quality was of course impressive.
These are just some of the things I had at the time. The controller is a Gamecube style controller:
The glasses for the tracking system got a bit more expensive as time went on.
The camera was a Gamecube style camera.
The power cable went into the PS2.
The back was a slim PS2 system.
The battery life was also very disappointing.
The only real downside was that the batteries were not very long.
I wish Sony had grown and improved upon the current-gen systems.
