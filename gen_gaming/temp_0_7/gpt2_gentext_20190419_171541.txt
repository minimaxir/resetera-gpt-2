~!~What's the best way to play PS4 games?

SoundCheck: I've been wanting to play some PS4 games and I think I've found that the best way is to buy the latest version, everything costs more and you can play it on the latest version with suspend/resume. Is there a good reason for this?
-----
Aurc: Buy the latest one, there are plenty of recent ones coming out.
-----
carlosrox: Play the latest ones. They're great.
-----
Aokiji: Ps plus games seem great

MaximusPayne: I have a shiny new slim.
-----
TwistedChemical: I have a friend who plays Oddworld: New noldales classic and we’re both happy.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Buy the latest one, they are great.

SoundCheck: I'm asking a mod to delete this post

I've never played PS4 games, but there are a ton of PS4 ports that I've heard good things about.

~!~What are the chances Nintendo will release a pro controller in the future?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I'm not talking about a mid-gen game where you can play Mario on joycons, or Sonic on a gog controller, or Kirby in handheld mode. I'm talking about a game where your game has a near-future-ish ambition. 
I think it's possible, but Nintendo has trouble sustaining a controller community that's large. Right now they have a handful of products, but the amount of releases this gen seems pretty small, and I don't think that's sustainable for them.
I feel Nintendo would be wise to focus on selling detachable controllers instead of a stick and pad. I'm guessing they don't have a lot of confidence in the rumored NSFW revision to release alongside it. I think the 2D side of 3D Mario is a more obvious option.
-----
vestan: I think they'll just stick to a standard Joycon grip. I don't know if it's a lot different than a plain colored joycon but it'd make more sense than standard joycons. Maybe add a d-pad toggle for the touchpad and the touchpad to the joycon. I think they'll mix things up a bit.
-----
Kuro: They won't have a plain colored joycon so I imagine it'll still be stock.
-----
HockeyGuy412: I wonder if they'll put out an official switch pro controller.
-----
wild wild rice: I don’t think Nintendo wants to get you in that trench. They may as well make their own “Smash” style set of controllers. 
If they’re serious with a revision of a stick and pad, I’d just stick to the official Nintendo Pro Controller. It would be nice, but it would make a lot more sense for them to stick to a standard controller.
-----
weekev: Considering they told us we could change our screen to the size of paper, I think they'll keep a regular controller. Just like how the pro was official when they were made a thing. No more ink ramps thats nice.
-----
Jon Carter: It will be used for Smash.
-----
JakeNoseIt: This. It's the only reason I care, they'll sell a new stick and pad.

~!~If you have a Vita TV, what features should you get next?

CrimsonCrescendo: So, I have a Vita TV, and it's a damn bang combo. The thing is, I'm not buying games on it anymore, because I want to see what the most impressive and fun thing on the system is, and even if I don't have the absolute most fun with my current gaming experiences, I have a moderate interest in games that really scratch that itch.
Right now, I'm watching Bloodborne, a game that's so damn good, and I'm thinking about playing the Zero escape series, a game I loved when I was a kid and I had a burning desire to play.
The one thing that really, really grabs me, and the reason for that is, is the fact, that I find it, I play this game at night, and it's just so damn fun to play. I'm not saying I can't play it, but I find it so fun, that I don't care about not having my "main" party up at night.
Now, I'm not saying I have any real powers, I just
-----
NediarPT88: Most things, there's a lot more to it than I would think.
For example, I don't know if I would like that pixel perfect hack for the Vita, I know that it's not a hack, and I use it because I like that pixel perfect hack.
I know I can't hack it, but I want it.
-----
Hexa: I agree with your post.
Most things, there's a lot more to it than I realized.
For example, I read a lot more on the appstore than I do on the Vita. I got a ton of spare time from my backlog.
-----
Eolz: I don't know about some of the other consoles, but I assume you can use the remote play feature to play games on the Vita TV (unlike Steam/PS3/Wii U remote play).
-----
Ryo: The thing with the vita is that it is very light for a home theater, so games are not possible on it.
I'd rather play games in my bed than use the tv if I have to use a gamepad, which is not a valid reason for not having a tv for streaming.

Frecklestein: It's $29.99 for the Best Buy version for anyone who pre-ordered it on Switch.
I have my fingers crossed that it will be a great game for people who prefer a more action/character focused experience over pure fighting, or those who want an updated experience over the long term.

~!~What is the best and newest game you may not have heard of yet?

RedSwirl: With a lot of recent games being announced for next-gen, it got me thinking about what you may not have heard about yet. For me it's definitely Black Ops IIII.
Watch Dogs 2 is coming out next year. I know it's getting hate, but the game has such a positive community and very active discussion, as well as a new trailer at Gamescom, and that's just the beginning.
I'm also really excited about Black Ops 4 and I'm curious to see what Era thinks. I think I've heard a lot of interesting things about it and it's perhaps my favorite stealth game, ever. Anyone else?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I think The Last Guardian is a game Ubisoft should work on (really liked it and would love a new entry, but they gotta release a new game first)

~!~How would you feel if Nintendo Switch Online would stop working?

God_Of_Phwoar: So, Nintendo Switch Online is the No. 1 game on my Switch and I'm planning on paying for it. My plan is to buy the games individually, and to eventually subscribe to the service. I'd like to continue playing the online games until March 2020.
If Nintendo Switch Online was the No. 1, it would mean that the Switch Online would never end. It's currently working as a paid service, so it shouldn't be that much of a shock when Nintendo announces it's ending.
What about you? How would you feel if Nintendo Switch Online would not work?
-----
BubbleButt64: I wouldn't pay for the service, personally.
-----
Raysoul: It would suck.
-----
Kamiyouni: I would be very shocked.
-----
neufel: I want to pay for the subscription but I dont have enough money to buy many games. I would be disappointed.
-----
Cybersai: I would pay for the service but would definitely not play the games online.
I'm also not interested in online multiplayer.
-----
Cess007: I think Nintendo Online should stay free. I want to pay for gaming.
But I never play online.
-----
TubaZef: I'd pay for it, but I'm not going to pay for a subscription that drains the rest of my valuable experience.
-----
Conor419: I think it's a huge waste of time.
-----
Kouriozan: I’d pay for it but paying for it won’t change my opinion on the service.

~!~Anybody play a good mmo with a lowkey, accessible difficulty mode?

Mugy: I'm currently playing The Witcher 3(I think it's that good?) and it is really, really fun, I don't think it's even an option to play with friends other than to grind it.
I've heard some people playing Ninja Gaiden Black and Dark Souls 2, but I'm wondering if those are really fun? I've heard that Ninja Gaiden Black has a harder mode where enemies can kill you faster, but it doesn't seem to be as fun?
-----
Jaded Alyx: Skyrim.
-----
Dreamboum: Ninja Gaiden
-----
Hace: it's a fun, accessible mode
-----
BDS: Ghost Trick has a difficulty mode where you can both kill you in 2 hits while juggling, and you can replay the entire game with it
-----
hydruxo: Dark Souls 1 has a difficulty mode where you can either get punished for dying or have the difficulty change depending on your performance. It's a sort of alternation game playstyle where you choose how hard you want to play the game and your playstyle will play differently depending on what difficulty it is.
-----
Mugy: That's a fun one! Thanks! I was just wondering how to get people to even play Dark Souls with a normal difficulty. 
I wonder how the difficulty will work when doing the NG+ (gather all the souls you want) and NG+ (Gather the rest) modes. I should have mentioned this in the OP haha.
-----
Jaded Alyx: You can play NG+ with the difficulty you want, then continue. It's a sort of alternation game playstyle where you can choose to play with a difficult NG+ player and explore the game with a normal player.
-----
Lumination: I find the Ninja Gaiden difficulty mode to be much more fair due to the lack of level scaling. That said, I don't enjoy NG+ very much.
-----
dancingphlower: Dark Souls has a difficulty mode?

~!~Wait, did I just buy their Ikaruga reboot?

Luulubuu: The Ikaruga reboot is an Ikaruga reboot in the vein of the Ikaruga Returns reboot, they changed some characters and gameplay etc, it's basically a reboot with a new character, it's a reboot with a new gameplay and with new ideas, it's basically what Ninja Theory's Ikaruga Team had been working on for a few years now, it's like a new Bloodborne.
Is this bigger than Lords of the Fallen? It's smaller than Shadows of the Damned.

NotLiquid: it's pretty bad

-----
ChaosSmurf: They said it'll have a new character.
-----
Kurdel: I love this franchise. 
I wonder how many games they are publishing..
-----
ChaosSmurf: They did try to get a new ninja school setting for a while, it was mentioned once that the devs were approached by a company like Devolver Digital, and they said they already had a character they wanted to make a new ninja game about, and it took them a while, they then said they had a publisher and that if they could get someone to do it for them, it would be cheaper.

~!~Should the PS4 Pro be a special case?

theofficefan99: I'm playing on PS4 Pro at the moment. It's gorgeous and I love the design and the replayability.
But I have a problem with the slim.
The Pro's OS is so obtuse and unintuitive. It's not a Pro, it's not a portable PS4. And I've already started playing Rocket League with my friends on PS4 Pro. 
I'm not even sure I'm playing it properly, I've been playing it on PS4 Pro. 
I just wanna be sure that the PS4 Pro will be a great experience.
-----
Xiaomi: I think there will be a point in the next few years where people will adapt and start to buy more and more consoles.
-----
KarateBusinessman: No, nobody is ever going to figure out what "PS4 Pro" means.
-----
Knight613: If people thought they were PS2s they'd be insane.
-----
Kenzodielocke: Because if they do a slim and a Slim combo, they will be able to keep so many games running better than before.
-----
Kyoufu: I thought Sony was the only company that made a good PS4 slim yet.
-----
Xiaomi: I agree. Letting people debate what a PS4 Pro is really like is the only reason we don't have proper discussion threads like the old one or ResetEra.
-----
Puffy: I want to believe
-----
Horned Reaper: I believe it's the PS4.

~!~I hope the new God of War is like the old one and is faithful enough to be faithful...

HououinKyouma00: This game is in my Top 5 games of all time. This is the game to get me back into Sony first party.
1. Uncharted 4 
2. The Last of Us
3. The Last of Us: Ascension
4. Uncharted Lost Legacy
5. Horizon
I have a hard time believing this will be the best entry in their series. I just hope this will set the sales bar high enough for them to get the franchise back on track.
What do you guys think?
-----

Hawk269: I don't see what you are looking for in terms of being faithful to the original. GoW is graphically beautiful, the combat is great, the story is decent and the action moves along nicely. I do however believe that it is a bit of a stretch to call on the original story being good, as it is in many respects. From what I remember Uncharted 4 was a great game, but the story was some of the strongest parts of the game, and I am not sure if the story would have been as good without Uncharted 4. I do however remember the gameplay being great, and the story being well paced.
-----
Abu: dunno if I should call it that
-----
PSqueak: Don't think you're really faithful to the original.
-----
Cess007: I think you should consider that God of War Ascension is more of an adaptation of Kratos's creation.
-----
Vipu: Yeah, Ascension is a huge part of the experience. The game is graphically stunning, but the gameplay is not.
-----
Phantom Thief: I agree with you, but I think the real reason for the lack of faith in the original is because the creation of Kratos's consciousness was not initially created with the understanding that he would be created in this manner. The creation was basically a 'weakened' version of what happened in The Old Hunters to him. That in turn, made the new Kratos more like the old Hunters, and less like a clone.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, the lack of faith in the original is something I do not agree with. The new Kratos is just a different version of him, and is not created with this sort of artificial "

~!~Do you use the "slow to pick up" controller?

dawgparty: I've been wanting something like this for a while. I've heard it's super slow, but I just want to play something quick. I don't have the willpower to really pick it up any slower than this, but I've been wanting something similar for a while. Do you all have this problem?
-----
TransEuropaExpress: I do, but I don't 'get' it.
-----
Shark: I've had this problem for a long time as well.
I just find it obnoxious and annoying.
-----
Ametroid: I usually just go for whatever's in the middle and I feel like it's not bothering me at all
-----
Puffy: No, I prefer the quick button presses of the face buttons.
-----
Daffy Duck: Nope.
I used to have this problem for the PS2 so it’s always slow to pick up. 
Sometimes I used to have this problem, but I’m ok with it for now.
-----
BlueBomberX: I don't.
I used to have this problem but I don't.
-----
Zacmortar: I like having quick button + shoulder buttons but not having FOV
-----
King of Dreamland: I have this problem as well. I like having a short quick-release for the shoulder buttons which I find kinda half-assed, but I feel like I'd be just out of the target set of the standard FOV and it'd feel a bit less precise and less fun.
I've also always been turned off to a console/PC controller. I don't really use the options in my games either.

~!~RTTP: Super Mario Odyssey

Dragnipur: After getting the Odyssey Switch in the mail, I decided to hop back in today and check out the progress of the main game.
Now I've dabbled in the other 2D marios, but I never got around to SMO. I've heard the previous two marios had a lot of jank so I decided to give the one on the Switch a shot.
I had never played this game before. Just a quick rundown of the mechanics:
When you beat a stage, you get this special dream sequence.
This is just a dream until you reach the outdoor jungle.
After reaching the beach you find Mario and Peach dead.
Mario goes to the underground portion of the jungle and collects the remaining marios in his boat.
Mario then comes back to the main menu and starts to talk to the people that died.
I have no idea what this is but you're the bad guy in this world.
After collecting all the moons you get this feeling of "I'm going to get it".
I've tried to explain this to people but I'm not really feeling it, but some people here seem to think it's just a dream.
But I'm just here to say that the traversal in SMO was the best part about SMO. You could go anywhere, you had a lot of freedom in the game and you had a lot of backtracking.
The music, the graphics, the story....it all coalesces into one cohesive whole. I'm not saying it's my favorite mario game but it was a fun ride.

Kamiyouni: Incredible game.

Cess007: I always wanted to play this but I never got to it. But now I finally have the chance. So I'm here!!!

Thewonandonly: So I’m in the market for a new PS4 Pro system and I’m kind of afraid of getting caught up in all the moving pieces of the marketing machine. I have a Prologo and a backlog that is driving me to my breaking point right now. I just wanted to help and I can’t figure out what to do to save one of my more important consoles. I have a blank check policy so I don’t have to pay for stuff with PayPal or credit card and I’m just wondering if I’d be better off saving up for a new console or getting another.

texhnolyze: I can play Overwatch in Overwatch or PUBG.
But, I'm not really a shooter person. I prefer to use motion aiming for everything. So, I want to play something like:
- Aiming while shooting at the same time, means instant death.
- etc.
I will wait for someone to explain their solution.
-----
Nostradamus: It has to be either playing fast or using contextual controls. I like fast approaching enemy camps or the fast running. The latter for slow zombies and battlefield.

Max Payne: If they're using the controller then snap to a shoulder to shoot.

~!~My PSN account is stolen, now I’m broke!

dietpepsi: Hi all,
I was hacked and have had to change my account and change everything in the PSN. I think my account was stolen and I don’t even know what to do. I’m not really thinking about it, but now my account is going to be violently affected and I’m afraid of what I’m risking everything for! I have to do this 3 times now. First I check my email and if it’s from a thief I can say they tried to steal my account but they never tried and now my account is in danger!
Second I check my email again and got the confirmation code. I just checked my account to make sure it’s not a scurrilous attempt.
Finally I don’t have to worry about changing anything. I’ve never had this happen! I’m so proud of my username and PSN ID! I don’t have to guess around!
Any advice Era can offer?
-----
J75: You can change your PSN name and if you do it without a change you are a fucking bank robber.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: You don't have to worry about it. Just remove the account and call it out you mean its theft
-----
DanteLinkX: I change my password everytime and my email to this
-----
AxeVince: You can at least change your PSN name and ID.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I changed mine a few weeks back to a new name and ID, not sure if that helped or not though.
-----
dietpepsi: Good luck, but you can check your account when you're not logged in. If you do that then there's no point in changing my ID.
-----
Eoin: There are two things to consider here.
1) You have at least 2 different email associated to your account. If you change it to the name you will get that when you log in, and then the 2 email accounts are linked across two devices to verify your email address.
2) If you don't change your name, you won't receive a mail from the PSN account itself, since that account is a separate user account from my primary PSN account.

~!~LTTP: The Evil Within 2

ManCityX: I’ve had this game in my backlog for a while now, and as someone new to the series I really appreciate how well it’s been applied to this series.
I really enjoyed the first one, but the second one really dragged. I was enjoying it, but it was a little grindy towards the end without feeling like I was playing a short section of the game.
The second one was actually pretty good, and I enjoyed the game for what it was, but both felt like the game was taking a back seat and the first one was a bit too long.
I would probably start playing the second one again if I was going to wait on reviews before buying it.
-----
Skittles: The first one is definitely a grind but the second one is so much better
-----
TheBeardedOne: I played the first one for the first time and got lost in it. It's not like the second was a very good game. It's not because there's too much. It's just that the first is much more polished.
-----
Gbraga: The first one isn't a great game. It's not even a good game by any means. I'd go with the sequel.
However, the second one is phenomenal, and I was really surprised that it was up to the developers to make a sequel based on the first game. Like, I didn't know there was a third.
I like the first game, but it's not that I liked the second. It's that I thought the game's level design was a bit too obse.
-----
Rurouni: I enjoyed the first one, but didn’t love the second one.
-----
ManCityX: I think the first game was a little too linear. I can get where you are coming from, but I think the way you think about the game changes a lot in a lot of ways.
-----
ScOULaris: There's nothing particularly wrong with the first. The second one is certainly not a dull or derivative of the first.
-----
Kuro: I really liked the first one.
-----
Gbraga: I didn't.
I'll pick the sequel up, I just can't.

-----
Twentieth: He's got no impersonation whatsoever for his PR guy, but it does sound like a PR guy.
-----
kennyamr: Jim on this one, he's just a PR guy.

Kolx: It's crazy that one person on Twitter gets the guy's nickname out so directly.

Sotha_Sil: This is why I never trust Twitter.

Aters: I mean, he's just a PR guy.
-----
Truant: Makes sense.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I don’t think anyone uses it as impersonator 
Jim certainly doesn’t mean to relate someone to a joke but this should be a wake up call to Twitter and publishers that they should just remove all that PR shit and then I’d just be all over this whole mishmash of a thing going on 
It’s not like it’s a social media thing and it’s getting a lot of attention and attention on Twitter right now because it’s Jim’s name and all that.

~!~The VR hit that 2019 needs

Osiris397: If we're curating this thread with games that are going to hit the market next year, what are you think?
I feel like the Oculus Quest will be the last VR device to be looked at in the VR space. There's a lot of competition in the market now. 
More VR games to play in the future can help push the envelope of what can be done with VR.
-----
Loudninja: Good for y’all.
-----
Wollan: Good to hear. Doom vr hit?
-----
PurpleMoustache: I don't think there's a word for VR in this medium.
-----
cakely: Awesome!
I'm in. Deathost Fight is the only one I've heard of. I hope Oculus have their VR headset on ready for the holidays.
-----
Sangetsu-II: I'll be sure to support this.
-----
Oliver James: Doom vr is silly, but I can't imagine it being difficult to try.
-----
Sangetsu-II: The intent is for the people who owns the platform to be able to use it for personal use.
-----
cakely: And it's free.

Majiebeast: I'm sure many will try it.

NKnight7: Hopefully early release for now.

Riversands: Hope it isn't too late to announce it

MosquitoSmasher: Finally, the real surprises.

alundra311: I hope it's early and good. I'm tired of this type of gameplay so I'll wait until it's polished.

~!~Is it safe to buy a PS4 Pro?

Niosai: So, I have a problem. I have no idea what I'm buying, but I've decided to buy it. I've never done a microSD card or a flash drive before, so it can't fit in my PS4. I have a new TV, so it's a no-brainer.
Is it worth it?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: No
-----
Papercuts: No.
-----
Hieroph: Have you tried replacing the optical drive on it?
-----
-J-: I think you should be able to do this and it won't hurt your PS4.
-----
asd202: It's not a problem tho imo.
-----
Lant_War: I'd say the process is safe.
-----
Kyoufu: You want to try something from the Video Display Support?
-----
Niosai: I've had it since I bought it a few years ago, and I've done a few things, but I'm still unsure if it's safe to buy one.
-----
AegonSnake: If you make some mistakes on console like deleting all the data, or deleting all the firmware - not sure what you mean by "revooting the console" - go try this. Its not that hard.
If you don't get anything working, go back to the menu.

~!~I think "big" games should be more about the design and the execution than the numbers

AuthenticM: Tell me about all this talk about how Mega Man 11 is the best Mega Man game, and not about how the rest of the series is the best Mega Man game. I'll start off by saying that this is not a man talking in a fair sense, and I'm not sure the person talking is a masochist, so I'm not sure what I'm even getting into here. So I'm basically defining something.
This "big" game is not about the quality of the game itself. Maybe it's just a simple design decision or another form of humor, or maybe there's some other reason and function of Mega Man's personality that creates the game's appeal. I don't know. I can tell you what I'm about to list, and I can offer a few examples.
1. The Silver Case
This is the game that got me to stop playing Mega Man. I didn't love the game itself, but I thought the story of this game was really interesting. The way the Silver Case turns on after the first time you fight the Maverick bosses is really interesting. The way the island gets changed into a twist after you escape was also really interesting, and the melodrama of solving it all was really good. There's a lot of highs and lows here, but I really think this game has the most twists and turns in an attempt to make it a deconstructionist, story-driven experience. It's hard to describe what I mean because it's hard to describe how this game's story turns into an antic
-----
WonderLuigi: No. Zoids is the first thing that made me consider Zoids as a game.
-----
sir_crocodile: I agree, it's super hard to talk about without knowing what the game is about
-----
Lunar15: Nah, it's more about the story being part of the larger mythos and the game being about Mega Man.
-----
Tibarn: I really liked the game, but I didn't like the Silver Case as much as Test of Force. I personally don't like the game, but I really liked the story and the mystery from the start, so I think it's best to just stick with it.
I think the reason why the game is so popular is because of the way it was

Dremorak: Finally. The Warframe devs just posted some good news!
They also just announced that the first three missions for the first mission are coming soon to the steam version:

Zephyriel: I am almost done with the game, I just need to get through the progression.
-----
Calibro: I wonder why I keep getting ads for the game. The ads are just for the new updates.
-----
Valdega: It's been out for a while now. I'm glad it's not the same kind of content drip feed you get with DLC.

Dremorak: Also they added the new space shmup)
-----
Bansai: I'm on the last one, might try the new one out.
-----
Lunar15: It's been out for now.
-----
Frox: I'm on the last one. It's an abysmal performance in the PC version.
I got my copy of the game on a sale a few months ago and I'm still in agony with the damn thing.
The new update is the most insane one I've played in awhile.

Conkerkid11: Was planning on giving the game a shot when I saw the demo was available.
I'll probably check it out on sale.

~!~Marvel Games Exec Calls Spider-Man PS4 The King of Consoles “of the Shadows”

DeoGame: 
-----
Kraken3dfx: In other words, they don't really mean that Spider-Man PS4 is the first game in the comics or that they don't like it. They just speak of it as "the first Spider-Man game".
-----
Nakenorm: I mean, if you count the last one:
-----
hughesta: it's nice to see people calling Spider-Man the first game
-----
Jawmuncher: How many game franchises are more than just a name? There are so many more games being made at this point.
-----
Jawmuncher: Yeah but this is a new thread. So we don't really have to give Spider-Man anything to be the first game in the universe. 
I'd just say it's appropriate to call Spider-Man the first game in the universe.
-----
RPG_Fanatic: I mean, there is a connection, but it's just a name.
-----
FelipeMGM: They don't mean "Spider-Man PS4" as in Spider-Man PS2....

~!~Why does Nintendo have trouble getting console recognition when they own the IP?

Hero of Legend: And just to clarify, I'm talking about the Metroid games themselves, not the other way around.
When it comes to Nintendo, I've never been able to enjoy their IPs or even come across these characters or their manner of speak or whatever, and I'm not the first time a series like Metroid catches my attention with respect to this.
But I'd like to ask, why? Do you think Nintendo is too focused on the mainline titles or busy working on individual franchises? Or is it too busy working on a Nintendo characters?
I mean, really, they want their franchise to grow and become a full-blown Nintendo system now, but they've never gotten Super or Link in that regard.
-----
Sebastopa: Because they can.
-----
Daitokuji: Because Nintendo doesn’t seem to be interested in individual franchises.
-----
mrmickfran: Because they don’t seem interested in individual franchises
-----
TheStebe: Nintendo is just too kool for nothing
-----
KtotheRoc: Because they don't seem interested in individual franchises.
-----

Hero of Legend: Well, it's a genre! They're not trying to be an all-streaming service, they're just trying to have a steady flow of releases at a consistent, consistent pace.
-----
sambills: Nintendo has no commitment with singleplayer games. 
Like, you can't just release a new Mario Bros. every two years like Sony or you have to have a defining game IP that encompasses the entire block. 
And I say this as someone that has played tons of Mario Kart 8, Odyssey, and other Switch titles.
-----
Smurf: I mean, if you look at Nintendo, they're the one brand I can't care about.

====================
~!~Should I buy a PS4 Pro and wait for PS5?

mogster7777: I mean I’m considering this because I saw that PS5 is coming out soon and most people are waiting for a PS5. I’ve been waiting a long time for a console I can play it on and I’d wait until next year. I’ve already got a PS4 Pro but I’d like to get rid of my Nvidia Shield TV. Is there anything that stops me from buying another PS4?
Also is the PS5 worth it if I’d wait for next-gen? I’ve been playing Horizon on my X1X and the game looks amazing. Is it enough to jump in with the next Xbox?
-----
Plidex: If you don't mind any of the games you already own then don't skip it.
Horizon is incredible and a perfect blend of PS4 and Xbox One.
-----
Pikagreg: If you don't mind the exclusives play your best.
-----
Wollan: 3rd party support is a big reason why I've held off on buying a PS4 and getting a Pro.
I'm sure there's plenty of other reasons but I think the one most important factor is the install base.
-----
Puffy: If you don't mind any of the exclusives you already own, go for it.
-----
Knight613: If you don't mind anything, just get the pro.
-----
Cartridge Games: If you want to get a slim, get the slim.
If you don't want to play the latest multiplats, wait for the next Xbox.
-----
Soph: Don't.
-----
mogster7777: I’ve been really debating about this. It’s been a long time since I’ve heard anyone say or mention that it’s worth it to buy another PS4 but now I’m thinking about it again as I always do this.
I’ve been playing some new multiplats lately and it’s impressive that I can get a PS5 in a few more months like I did for the PS4.
-----
Knight613: You can just buy a PS4 and play it on a PS5. That's it.

~!~Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life (Switch) is really good

MouldyK: I was just playing the first game of a 10-12(ish) year old new leaf game when it occurred to me that I was thinking of a Metroid 1, and I remembered that I always wanted to play this.
I look back and it reminded me of the first game, and I thought this was a great game.
What about you?
-----
SalvaPot: I haven't played the second one, but I know right off it was a franchise juggernaut.
-----
mrmickfran: The franchise peaked with the first one
-----

Psychotron: The first one was the best. I poured 100s of hours into it and it was never once too easy.
-----
Weiss: I've played this series many times and will always be counted among the Metroid-is-the-best people in the world.
-----
Jessie: Still the series with the best MP games of all time.
-----
Phendrift: I’d love to play this series again, but I have a feeling it’s gonna be put to a hard halt due to the sales
-----
Jawmuncher: I know exactly what you mean OP. The second one was fantastic. I’d love to play it again.

====================
~!~What's your favorite way of playing Monolith Soft RPGs?

mindsale: They tackle the series in such an efficient way, eschewing RPG mechanics and stat-based gameplay. I think they've nailed the pacing and story of the first two games for the first time, and I remember the first few monolith soft RPGs being padded out with dialogue qua except that the in-game stat-based gameplay was enjoyable. I suppose the core appeal of their games is in their depth and depth of skinning their enemies, and the more engaging they are for that, the more meatier they are for eating those bites off enemy limbs to flesh out their party.
They've never gotten the confidence to do that, and that's why the grinding in the first two games (and especially NG+) is so-so painfully frequent.
In my experience, these games have been the ones that I enjoy the most despite their age. I can't play them again, even if I'm willing to indulge in the faux-Odyssey-esque humor (though I've no doubt the series will be rebooted). But an hour of wandering around the world, trying to acquire every piece of gear you can (and failing hilariously) and trying to beat your first chapter of Monolith's castle. But seeing every piece of equipment you encounter is a cathartic cathartic cathartic call.
I've been playing for the longest time, and it's given me the same sense of awe and satisfaction over the games that I had previously given up on. I can still see the patterns of architecture, marvels, intricacies, forms, fights, and even the environments themselves. The only thing that's somewhat facile is the area where you find one of the main dungeons.
And that's not even the most important bit:
I put three hours into it in a single sitting. Great experience.
-----
Phantom Thief: Play it in order.

~!~The Nintendo Switch Online family of games

T002 Tyrant: I've found that my son has very different experiences playing Nintendo games online. He is very good at Mario Kart, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Kart 7, Mario Tennis Aces, Mario Tennis Aces, Mario Kart 8 and Mario Tennis Aces. He has played Mario Kart 64, it's been a lot of fun and he is now finishing the games he want to play.
I got him Mario Kart Wheels, which he may get on the Play-Asia sale. I have yet to try Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Mario Tennis Open but I am looking forward to playing Mario Kart. I have tried Mario Tennis, Mario Party, Smash and Pikmin.
I think that if he gets Mario Tennis, he could play around with it. And if he gets Mario Kart, he could play around with that. I have tried Lucky Strike and Mario Rabbids. And I have tried Lucky Strike but it doesn't work well for my son.
I also tried Mario Tennis, Wolfenstein II and Animal Crossing but those didn't really pick up with him. That said, if he gets Mario Kart, he could play around with it and maybe play with his younger sister.
I wanted to see if anyone has tried this with their sons.

I’m curious what your favorite Pokemon game is.
Personally I’d give the Gen 2 games the nod as I love them so much but I’m also curious about the original game.

WrenchNinja: The world and art of the Pokemon

Awesome news.

Nirolak: Dragon Quest XI, Kingdom Hearts III, Shadow Hearts III and the next Dragon Quest will all be affected by the company's creative leaders' comments.
Highlights:
This is what Cygames has said on Twitter in the past about their ambitions for their future games.
Dragon Quest XI's future is in the collective vision of all 3 Dragon Quest games developed on Gearrice. This is their next project. They want to have as many Dragon Quest games as possible developed in their spare time.
Kingdom Hearts III's future is in the collective vision of all 3 characters developed by Xseed. This is how they are going to tackle the next Dragon Quest.
New ambitions for the future of the company.
This is what The Balance of Play has to say about the status of Final Fantasy in the West.

It also helps that The World Ends With You was a massive seller in Japan and abroad.

~!~I'm really sick of Nintendo games not being on my radar

Gn0mercy: I've been playing Hollow Knight, and I really like it, but the developer actually put in the work in the DLC, and it's not exactly what I would have expected in a game like Hollow Knight.
For example, I never felt like I was in control of the character in HK, I'd always get stuck and never do anything if I didn't have the free time to play the game at work, so I'm not really interested in playing the game at home. The game just doesn't make me feel like I'm in a game, I don't feel like I'm spending money on it. I've been playing games since I was a kid, I'm an adult now. This is why I'm bringing my Nintendo systems with me as I'm traveling. I'm really tired of playing Nintendo games on the subway, since I feel like I'm doing more commuting than gaming in the subway.
Then there's games that I'd never recommend to those who have them, I don't think I've ever heard a non Nintendo game had a great soundtrack.
-----
Gundam: I still have my Gamecube from when I was a kid that has the soundtrack of metalcore. 
The best Nintendo games are Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2.
-----
Dreamboum: I've not played Hollow Knight but I know it's a very early game and not really worth a play on a long weekend. I think most people are on the fence about it or they're completely indifferent. There's a lot of great stuff, but people are still lagniavered in the combat department.
-----
KZXcellent: Xcom
Metal Gear Solid
-----
Zalman: I have all 3 except Xenoblade Chronicles. It's probably the most fun I've had with Nintendo, but I've been having trouble getting into it.
-----
Khadoken: I mean, a lot of the games you mentioned play fairly differently so I would just say to just take your time with it. Not to mention, you are better than average. I don't recommend it to everyone.
-----
Phendrift: I’d just say I’m not normally into Nintendo’s games, but I’ll say Xenoblade Chronicles and Hollow Knight.
Hollow Knight is a great game

~!~If you ever looked at the PS1 version of Final Fantasy 5 and wanted to play again, what happened to it's translation?

Trojita: I've always been fascinated with the translation of Final Fantasy 5. I remember reading that Sony Japan would pick up the story and port it to the PS2, but never took the time to care for it at all.
I've never been that interested in the game, though, and I've always been curious to see how it turned out. I was big into the series, and my first RPG was with a PSP, and I did the side quests with the same amount of effort and pride. I really liked the script and how the characters spoke, and I liked how the story was told in a Japanese plot book. I read the first few pages of the story on a regular basis, but I've never seen or heard a Japanese translation of the game.
It's been a long time, after all. I never saw a copy of the game anywhere, and I've heard the Japanese version is vastly superior. I wonder what the translation was like back then...
Anyhow, I want to play Final Fantasy 5, and I've heard a great deal about it. I know there are some rough edges, but I think the chances are a lot of the game is missing.
-----
SantaC: I read a bit of the game is in japanese, but seems they are ok to play.
-----
ReyVGM: I would love to play this game, but I don't think it will happen.
I remember being told by some Japanese fans that I should play the game first, since most of the issues mentioned in the translation are related to the game being japanese.
-----
ReyVGM: This is my second thread.
-----
SOLDIER: It was in my wilder inner corner back when I read the first paragraph of this thread. 
I imagine that it would take a while to get used to it's basic mechanics.
-----
Deleted member 1258: I'm sorry but Final Fantasy 5 needs to be translated.

Trojita: I read the first few sentences of that sentence and was like "Wow, this game is so good"

~!~The best Assassin's Creed game?

KiLAM: I was just thinking about this and I decided to play as a new character. I kept thinking how in the world this game is just not the same.
I haven't played a game with this personality. It's not like the previous ones where you were "Soldier Onepeeps". It's a new town. It's just the same old town. You go to a place called Catena. There you get to know what this place is like. You have to go there and recruit a new character.
The game is so quick paced, there's no pacing that I can recall. The gameplay is fast and fluid. You have to get a character in the first mission and watch them traverse through the world and caves to find their target. I was trying to beat the game on hard and within hours.
If you think that this is a bad game then you should play the Ezio Collection. I loved playing through the Ezio Collection with my brother. It was a lot more Ezio inspired and had more missions. The first 2 missions were easy and did not require much memorization. The rest of the missions are amazing and you can even play fast and loose with the pacing.
I dunno about the rest of you but I really liked how the game played. I played Ezio games in release order and I always felt that the game was a sort of Ezio get a certain satisfaction out of the Connor games.
If you are a fan of Connor and Connor. If you are not a fan of Connor and Connor. This game was masterful in it's own way.
Anyone else being similar?
-----
Aokiji: Agreed. I’m bored of it with my only save being Connor’s
-----
Legitmcfalls: Its also my first AC and I agree it’s Connor's game.
-----
Falchion: The game is a blast and I've never completed the main story since I beat it before.
-----
Tekku: I loved Connor’s game and hated the "deep dive" style of it. The game was great though.
-----
KiLAM: I agree. I remember enjoying the game but I had to stop playing it for a few hours.

Mauricio_Magus: They should have a Law Offer announcement for that.

Oheao: Well, that's a bummer, considering how much the Switch homebrew scene has grown over the last few years.

Dyle: Why is this relevant to the real hacking threat, especially after a few weeks of no hacking?

~!~What are your favorite fighting game backgrounds?

chaosaeon: A recent topic on reddit inspired me to post my own favourites. I'll start with the one used for my favourite thread on era a few days ago.
I know there are several I like the most, but my pick is probably the original backgrounds I've always liked. My favourite being the original Titan Quest backgrounds from the game Secret of the Forest, they're colourful, have nice reflective textures, and are a little too cheerful.
-----

ChaosInScholar: I have a soft spot for these. Good variety of enemies, good variety of environments, good variety of bosses and bosses, and good challenge. 
Also the soundtrack is amazing.
-----

ChaosInScholar: Absolutely.
-----
Kirie: I really liked the backgrounds in the original Titan Quest. It's one of my favorites just because of how many different backgrounds there is. I love the music in general.
-----

ChaosInScholar: It's mostly just nostalgia to me, but I loved the backgrounds in the Secret of the Forest.
-----
elkniwc: And yes, I will always be fond of it.
-----
chaosaeon: I like that too. I'm not a fan of the "graphics" (that's ok), but the backgrounds of Secret of the Forest are amazing.

~!~Trying to get into the Octopath Traveler mood, which JRPG's do you like to share with us?

Memento: Hello, everyone.
How are you feeling about Octopath Traveler? I have been playing it a lot and I have a lot of opinions about the game. Thing is, I have never really been a big JRPG fan. I guess it took me a while to find myself enjoying it? But I found it interesting, challenging, unique, and had fun?
I don’t know about other games, but I think Octopath does have some really good games. And I am probably playing it more now. My favorite games are:
Dragon Quest V
Kirby: Star Allies
Dungeon Fighter Online
I have never really played a JRPG, outside maybe the MMOs. I guess I like them because I like the feeling and the challenge of the genre.
Which JRPGs do you like to share with us?
-----
ILikeFeet: Xenoblade Chronicles 2
It's my favorite JRPG of the generation
Playing as a Pirate or Dark Mage takes time to get right, and the world is too big and boring.
What's the best story to balance things out?
-----
CeroMiedo: Xenoblade 2 and Octopath Traveler is my favorite, I’d even say Xenogears is my favorite
-----
King of Dreamland: Octopath Traveler and Xenoblade 2 are the only ones I actually think are good JRPGs imho.
-----
Lead: Octopath Traveler.
-----
-Pyromaniac-: I have a lot like Xenoblade 2, but I enjoyed Xenogears a lot more.
-----
Aigis: Haven't played it in a while, but I liked Xenogears and I think the best is Bravely Second so that is a definite purchase for me
-----
Poppy: iirc, chrpg 2 is great
-----
Kromeo: Octopath is great
-----
theofficefan99: Octopath Traveler is the best of the bunch, and it's on the right price-point

~!~Do you like a good story? A good story is everything.

ToddBonzalez: I've been thinking about the same thing for a while now. I've enjoyed a good story for a long time, but I always seem to go back to thinking why it's bad to play specific games. 
I have a pretty fondness for the stories that are the backbone of the Firefly series but I always have a problem with bad stories in video games. The first Witcher game has a really well told story with the events of NieR Automata. This relies on the story being over-the-top nonsense (a lot of the Witcher's stories have ridiculous undertones) but then it's still a story about caring for a dead comrade and coming to terms with loss. The story of caring for a dead comrade is one of the most consistently dumb leading up to the climax. The plot of caring for a dead comrade is a convoluted mess that makes you care about a dead comrade more than a dead comrade. This is the dumbest plot I've seen in a game and then the dumbest gameplay I've ever seen in a game. The gameplay, the thing about the game. It's the plot of a dumb movie. The plot of a dumb game. The gameplay is an argument against being a god. The game tells you a dumb story and then the game keeps on tying the story to it. The story is dumb but it manages to surpire the gameplay to such a large degree that it is actually detrimental to the plot. The game tries to re-tease the plot every time and the gameplay is just laugh out at yourself for certain scenes. There is no narrative unto the gameplay in any game other than the nice combat. The game has no story, and it keeps on trashing the gameplay to the extent that it becomes pointless. 
The story of the game is a little more nuanced than the story of a good game, but it is still a very good story. And I like that. I like that the game tries to re-tease the story of a dead comrade. I like that the game lets me appreciate the dumbness, and the absurd, while allowing me enjoy the dumbness, and the absurdity, with which I try to keep the player invested. I like that the story is non-issue. The game is already laugh out at you for being a bad guy. The game is already overreacting and saying "

~!~The 6th Generation: New Era of Gaming

Cantaim: I have been making my point about the 6th generation of gaming for a while I think. I don't think the notion of the new generation is that old, I think the 6th generation is that new and everything you hear or read in gaming is the first generation you were playing it and everything you hear is the first generation you played it and it's all the reason people love video games and I think everyone that played it and read about gaming differs and is it the generation where you started playing games and not games you were playing before.
I feel like the idea I'm talking about is that you get to experience the new generation and experience the old one like how I used to. I mean I still think my generation was more of an older console generation and I think those factors are the main reason I still got into gaming over the previous one.
I really like the idea of a new generation of gaming when I think about it but I'm not sure if I like it or not. I think it's the idea of games being held back by technology which is why there's this rush to get better every generation and that's why I feel everyone that played the previous generation has fallen out of favour with technology so I think it's just another way to see the modern gaming landscape.
I feel like I'm not the only one that has this feeling and am feeling it lately.
I really like the idea of games being held back by technology so I'm not sure if it's the idea of games being held back by technology or if it's the other reason that's happened. I'm playing the new God of War and I really like it because I think it's an action game with a focus on platforming and difficult platforming but I find it difficult to get used to aiming so I think GoW is the most difficult because there's a lot of pressure in platformers to be precise because of the way it's used.
I honestly think the 6th generation of gaming is the generation where you have to get used to being able to aim and block, you have to get used to playing with the D-Pad, you have to play arts and crafts and whatever else is so it's hard for me to get into games. So I think I'm just sort of fatigued of games and I don't like that. I don't like that sort of accessibility when I play games

~!~LTTP: Horizon: Zero Dawn

Fiery Phoenix: I finally got around to playing this game a few weeks ago and I’ve had a blast so far.
I feel like this is the perfect blend of RPG and story-driven adventure.
The world is so well designed. The sense of scale is perfect. The quests are so well-designed. The combat is satisfying. The puzzles are well-designed too. The atmosphere is second nature. The story is as good as old tales do in modern times.
The worldfeel is perfect. The sound design is intact today. The lighting is appropriately lush. The physics are perfect. The environments and gameplay are just sublime.
I’m just now beating the bosses. I’m loving it.
I wish the open world was more lively. The way pieces of scenery move and rotate with the player’s pace. The way the world turns into an open world when you are driving or moving around. The sense of scale and scale. 
I also wish the vehicles were better. I wish there were more than a few. 
I wish the map was more cluttered. I wish the way the main buildings connected the city. 
I wish the way travel worked. 
I also wish the weapons weren’t as powerful as other RPGs. 
The whole game feels like a Witcher game in parts. 
The combat system is perfect. 
I’m enjoying the combat more than any other open world game I’ve played. 
I’m enjoying the story more than any other open world game I’m playing. 
I wish the puzzles weren’t as difficult. 
I wish the world and atmosphere were more lively. 
I wish the city and the way you navigate was more interesting. 
I wish the leveldesign was less convoluted and confused. 
I wish the way travel worked. 
I wish the weapons weren’t as powerful as other RPGs. 
I wish the city and the way you navigate was more interesting.

~!~Has anyone actually had a good time with a game on release day?

ReyVGM: Hi there,
I'm planning to buy the new God of War. I've been playing it a lot on release day. It's my first game in like 6 years, and yeah, I'm pretty disappointed with the game. I have like 15 "good" days, and by the time I'm done, I want to buy it again in my leisure time.
I'm playing on easy and have the hardest of goals. I'm not having any issues with enemies, bosses, or anything close to 30 minutes of play. Thank you for your time.
I'm not looking for a "game to play" type deal. I'm just curious if people actually like the game or not.

~!~I Bought A Video Game From A Small Publisher, Why Can't Anyone Deserve This?

TheGamingNewsGuy: I bought a video game from a small publisher, and now I don't want it anymore. I bought it to try the upcoming AC Odyssey, and I don't want the experience to end up being the same as the last time I played it. The game doesn't feel worth the money I paid for it, so why should I trust this small green platform again?
Personally, I like it, but it doesn't feel that great to me. I have still my PS4 which I bought in the past, but since not being subscribed to PSN I don't have access to many third party games which are much more expensive to develop and a premium box business.
I also don't like the look of the game, but now I have the feeling that this is a short term effort they might not want to bother with long term. I know seeing a game being discounted on the PSN store before it was initially released is a big deal, but what is even worse about it is that if you cancel from the store you can still access the old version of the game, even if you downloaded it for free.
The game doesn't look that great to me, but I remember the hype around the world of AC coming out in 2008 or 2009, the huge hype around Zelda, etc getting a lot of attention with the Wii and Wii U being the reason it was delayed. I have no idea why Nintendo has stopped with this thing, but I feel that perhaps they want to make sure they don't suffer enough to need to care about the small team, but I guess that could be a result of them taking a longer time to greenlight something which they feel is not worth the money when they feel it's more worth doing overall. Because if they don't want to be involved when it comes to developing games like this they may not want to continue with it.
I also find it strange that I don't like Zelda games, but I do, as I understand it, the new God Of War. I do not understand how the new Zelda games are still coming out and I do not understand why. I find it very hard to understand why this is the case, and it is really disheartening to know I can't change the culture of the medium by supporting this thing.
What I am trying to understand is why no game publisher or

~!~How Nintendo's Fortnite money is being wasted on mobile games

TheGhost: I'm watching a Jim Sterling video on the Nintendo lawsuit for The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and I was surprised to see that it ignores the fact that Nintendo's mobile game is just a custom built mobile game that was released for free with the paid DLC on launch day.
Why?
The reality is that they are making a lot of money off mobile games.
Let's take a look at the earnings before tax:
FYI
FYI, in case people had forgotten about this shocking news:
-----
KoolAid: Pretty shocking.
-----
XSX: What a drop in quality of everything Nintendo does.
-----
Regiruler: Breath of the Wild Mobile game is a pretty terrible game.
-----
Phantom Thief: Breath of the Wild is not a traditional Zelda title. It does not deserve the low honor of being a traditional Zelda title. 
Breath of the Wild is a game about a boy taking care of his boy. A Minecraft style story about him taking care of his boy. 
Nintendo's mobile game is a bad game.
-----
Frecklestein: Everything Nintendo does is a fucking mistake.
-----
TheMisterManGuy: They're making money off mobile games. And mobile games take money away from other parts of the hardware. It's a terrible business practice, but it's what it is.
-----
Phendrift: I’d bet that they’d drop a mobile game before they lose the IP to Epic’s Minecraft style game.

~!~Devil May Cry 5 Gameplay Trailer (PS4/XB1/Switch)

Dusk Golem: This was posted in the Switch trailer thread, but it got me to thinking about DMC. I remember reading this article a few months ago that mentioned the game had some pretty rough combat, and wondered what the general consensus was on the demo. They had a good amount of QOL improvements over the first two games, but for reasons unknown to me, the demo of Devil May Cry 5 went a bit under the radar and I wasn't really hyped for the game, to be honest. I'm pretty sure the original demo didn't really sell well on PC, and it's likely likely that Devil May Cry 5 will be their next major DMC game, so that's a pretty big deal for me, personally.
If you've been following DMC for the last year/decade, you might have noticed that it's a DMC game that has a lot of promise, but is just sort of stuck between two different beasts.
I'm talking about DMC5.
I'm talking about a new combat system.
And a few minor things I liked about the first game.
The demo finished with a demo area, which is what this is.
What I liked about the first DMC game, however, is that it did things right. The level design looked great and the amount of enemies and you had to work your way to it was really fun, but I also liked how the gameplay itself was almost similar to DMC 3. The sense of satisfaction you get from hitting things in the air and destroy them was really satisfying. I beat the demo a couple days ago, and now I feel like I'm in a DMC game again. I can go play a few more hours of this on my Switch right now since I got the last couple of updates in the last few months.
What I'm super looking forward to is the atmosphere and artstyle, and I appreciate how the game looks.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I'm playing it right now, I'm enjoying the combat so far.

Aurc: The only thing that's making me more hyped than what the first demo was is is the lack of a release date. That's a really weird lack, to have a demo to blow your eyes away.

~!~Is there a video game company that has the ability to localize a niche franchise in an incredibly shitty way?

Ultimadrago: Recently, I'm thinking about the Resident Evil localization of Silent Hill. I remember a discussion about if they could cut out the story heavy parts of the game and create a new one in a different character. This was the first time I've ever seen a game company that could produce a game that could be translated to English. I was wondering if anyone here had ever played a game that they could easily translate and give someone else the ability to localize the series. I know that a lot of the time Japanese games can be difficult to translate but what I didn't think was that the sooner a game developer could make a game that was completely localized in an accessible way it would come to English. Are there any companies out there that can do this?
I know that sometimes Japanese games can be difficult to localize and I have a feeling that is an issue, but maybe it's not the only problem.
-----
gfxtwin: I’ve been going back and forth on whether or not a localization is ever happening. I find myself not too far into the game myself.

deejay: Title pretty much says it all. I was promissed to do this survey, but never had the time to participate. I wanted to try my best to help build some interest in the industry. I want to know how y'all are? Which game engine/game series you've been tinkering away in, whether for games or the people around them, and why? Which franchise are you the most? Which franchise have you been tinkering away in? What game did you fall into the most? Which franchise are you falling into and why? And why?
I'm looking for a way to help motivate me to start playing more, and to help me to fall into the industry without feeling like I'm missing out. I'm looking for a specific goal to motivate me to dive into more games, and I'm asking to be as passionate or more passionate to support as I am. I'm looking for games that I've always wanted to dive deeper into, and that have really stuck with me.
I don't have time to really do surveys right now, so I'm just looking for suggestions on what I should start and then push through to try more games.

CannonFodder52: New onpone at Telltale Games Store.
I was just wondering if anyone’s got any impressions on the game with the previous Telltale titles?
-----
Cess007: I saw this and thought it looked interesting, but I'll wait for a sale to see if anyone has played it already.
-----
LiK: I heard this is a Telltale game.
-----
KoolAid: Is the story good?
-----
Razgriz417: looks cool, I'll wait for a sale to see if more people are interested (I know people liked it but I'm still wary)

KainXVIII: If you like Telltale, check out the TV show series.

~!~PSA: Get Monster Hunter World for free

SpartyCrunch: If you haven’t played MHW, you owe it to yourself to finish it. The game is great and I’m glad to see this is coming to Switch.
-----
Mondy: I think you mean the PS4 version?
-----
Schmitz: I've played World when it first came out on Vita, played it for a while on Vita when it came out on PS3. But I haven't gotten very far into it. I've since just started playing the Switch port.
-----
Crayon: I've had this game since release. I can tell you to stop. I just don't want to play it anymore.
-----
SpartyCrunch: God I can't wait to play this again.
-----
delete12345: OK, I wonder if there is a good Switch port for you?
-----
Iva Demilcol: I have not, unfortunately.
-----
Wander_: oh shit, this is the one I have to finish
-----
SoaringDive: I've been playing World for the past week. Never finished it, was really fun. If you haven't played it, you should!
-----
Mona: Hmmm, how far into the PS4 version is this game? I tried to play it on Vita once and it was a mess on PS4. I might try and see if I can find a solution.

~!~2018 E3 should celebrate the best gaming moments in gaming

Nemesis162: This should be celebrated by a lot of people in various parts of the world.
Sometimes it's really meaningful, it's really relaxing, it's about one of the best gaming moments in the past year and many people here should be here and already have the time they should have have to spend playing games.
This might be my one of the best gaming moments of E3 2018
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I remember being very impressed by the Nintendo E3 booth. They had so many games in the top 20 and the lineups looked complete. It had a lot of great announcements. 
Those games are the only ones that I don't think are coming this year, but I loved the ones they showed.
-----
Khezu: I remember being jaw dropping at the opening of Splatoon 2.
Spoiler
-----
Giolon: I’m fucking psyched for E3.
I’ve been hoping for one since the first reveal.
-----
Lant_War: I think the whole press kit for EA's E3 was a good moment. It was a big reason why I didn't grow up until EA was gone.
-----
ChaosSmurf: Yeah, the entire press kit was great, and that was from what I remember. Splatoon was the first time I actually felt truly included and it rocked me.
-----
Hate: I’m excited for E3.
-----
Zukkoyaki: It was pretty great to see the Nintendo booth and all the games you could pick up. I remember being really hyped for Doom and the first Zelda game, but those were just the first examples that came to mind.
-----
Mazzle: The Nintendo booth was great
-----
CaviarMeths: Nintendo is my favorite company.
I went, "wait a minute."

~!~What's your favorite way to share a game?

entremet: I've been replaying some Castlevania games and I have been replaying the 3 NES games. I like the sense of speed and connection, but I don't really like the need to actually explore the world. I just want to see all the different animals roaming around and talk to people, all the time. I've also played the N64 versions, but I don't really find them fun.
I guess I could give suggestions to someone who wants to play more games, but I'm not sure which approach they favor.
I know the cycle of life is important, so I wanted to see what is the best approach. I'm not asking about the time, because I know that's the point of this thread. I just want to see the best version of the game, which is the one I have, and the experience I'd like to share.
-----
Theswweet: I love the Nes Classics. I've also played the 3DS version of the game a bit and I really liked the time trials, but boy did the game overload put me off. I mean, you could do a simple but still have fun running around the city and talking to everyone, but I found it just so damn boring.
-----
Zippro: I was gonna say: "Sierra the Mammoth Game). Also available on the Wii if you haven't already.
-----
TheMoon: you can play it in any order, as long as you don't have too many kids.
-----
Solar Puffin: I'm currently going through Guacameez 1 and it's soo boring.
The whole game is... too much slow.
-----
Frecklestein: I mean, of course you can.
-----
Mekanos: Grandia
-----
entremet: Oh yeah, I also like those slow slow paced.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: With the death penalty, you can't just use the wii remote, or hack a Wii remote. It is a great way to play the game in any order.
-----
TheMoon: you can still go through it however you want.

~!~Why are people so hung up on the "gamers are bored, gamers are bored" narrative?

bananafactory: Something that seems like a weird concept at first glance. Why are people so hung up on the "gamers are bored, gamers are bored" narrative?
Because gamers are bored. And it's a persistent problem for gamers. There are few traits that stick with one hobby/type/type of person: Gaming, social media, and video games.
I'm not going to name name the other ones, but the problem is recurring in every facet of life. Whether it's in sports, crafts, jobs, or parenting.
I honestly have no clue. I'm just trying to understand this.
I'm not saying that gamers are being bored or that gamers are being "hung up their G's". I'm saying that the assumption that gamers are bored is perpetuated these days. The only consistent response I can give is this: "it's not the gamers" and that answers the dumb question.
Edit: I guess I didn't buy the article. I'll just read it.
-----
Cartridge Games: Because gamers are bored.
Not hung up on narrative driven companies that are bored, hung up on childish tropes like gamers and gamers are tired, and on media that is filled with garbage, and on people that want to change/create whatever they want to
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: The opposite for me. I don't like being told what to do. I don't like being told what to do. I don't like being told what to make a game. I don't like being told what to make a game. I don't like being told what to make a game. I don't like being told what you should do. To be frank, I think most people don't like being told what to make a game. They just want to feel good.
-----
Aters: Gaming is too individualistic. These are too different things to get together over.
-----
deejay8595: Because the internet sucked at the beginning.
-----
Mazzle: Because people just want to be treated like humans and not be told what to do.
-----
FireWarrior: because its ok to be a dick and complain about things thats not the games fault, and thats not the point of the companies products imo

~!~LTTP: Point Blank (Early Access)

theofficefan99: Okay so I'm deep in the beginning of my first month of Early Access, and I gotta say, I'm really enjoying this. I don't know how exactly the game is, but I have absolutely no idea what the hell it is. It's got a lot of elements that are basically pre-texts I don't really care about. The game has an annoying tonal shift from the more upbeat "HOLY SHIT!" to "I'm gonna punch the shit out of those guys!" to "WHY ARE YOU DOING EVERYTHING? I'M MAKING A PLANET! NOW JUST TOOK MY ASS TOO?"
I'm not far either, but I'm enjoying the game a lot. It's got great production values and the visuals are really good. The art style is gorgeous, and I really like the music. It's...not a perfect blend of realism and early 90s Skrillex, but I think it's a very objective look. It's pretty "90s-y" to the outside looking in the world, but I think it's very different. The gameplay is on point.
I did a lot of side quests, but mainly just repeating the same button-mash around, trying different things, and thinking about my character. I'm also playing on PC, and I think it's a really fun game. The characters are all charming, however.
I love the sound design, and I really like the way the world is divided in half, which is a real nice touch. I love that each floor has a story to tell. I like where the levels end and go to hell, but they never really deviate from what the game was going for. The game is very cinematic, and the way the world is divided in half is very interesting.
The world is divided in half like a cross between a cross and a cross motif, so it's interesting to know that the people on each side of the world will sometimes go on the offensive and/or the opposing side will concede to the opposing team. The player character is a blend of the Japanese anime tropes and more realistic anime tropes, so it feels like the player character is a protagonist, rather than a whole new character.
The game is very pretty and looks stunning (even better than the early Access release), so I'm really enjoying it.
I'm

~!~What's the best map in a fighting game?

Kain-Nosgoth: i've been playing fighting games since i was like 14 (mostly played kyu kyu), i was huge fighting game fan back then, i played all fighting games from the mid 90s up through the N64 dropping all the way to the PS1.
I've always loved the maps in the series, they're fun to play, i've had countless hooked up to the ol' mehus of Street Fighter V over the years, i love seeing how the players do it, i love seeing the crazy stuff the devs try to implement, it's just this whole hype and anticipation to play over and over, it's kinda weird, and so weird that when i play a street fighter game i never expect for a fighting game to have a good map, and then when i play a street fighter, I expect for the map to be pretty good, and then the next street fighter I'm excited around every corner, it's kinda weird, so randomness kinda sucks cause it's kinda entertaining to watch all these street fights, but then when i hear people talking about how good street fighter is...
Street Fighter is my favourite fighting game series, but the street fighter I tend to not really think of in that light, i tend to think it's the best because it's so packed into the map structure and the mechanics...
I don't know if it's because I'm a big fanboy or what, i like fighting games to have a good story, and having the maps in SFV is great, but like the rest of the series, the map design is really boring, i really do not like playing street fighter because it's easy as hell to learn, and it's hard to learn all of the routes, and it's one of the reasons why my friend didn't like playing SFV
-----
Heartskips: Was my first fighting game, so I had a lot to learn. I think it's the perfect balanced 'game' but I don't know if I can even say the same for most other people. SFV is the best in the series imo, but maybe it's not for you.
-----
Bansai: I love SFV, but I don't think I ever got to play SFV, for lack of a better term.
My first fighting game was Pal-Show (I'm pretty sure I played

It also has some of my favorite songs in the series, but when it comes to this thread, it's not my favorite favorite. So, what are your favorite recording session of the year so far?
Mine is probably pretty varied, starting with MGSV's, which is a very good start. When it comes to Rondo, I played with all the DLC characters, so I never had to much to learn, but I did end up playing a lot.
For a list of my favorites, I'd rank the following:

~!~What is the best way to play PS1-era 3D platformers?

Robinson: I have both the 3ds and Vita (I think both had DS ports, but I don't know the details on that) and I mainly play them. I've been wondering which games are the best to play on the handheld. I have all the consoles except for the 3ds, but it's kind of a hassle to play on a TV.
I've played most of the PS1 classics:
PS2
PSP
PS1
PSP
PS Vita
and I think even some of the Saturn ports are playable on the PS4.
I'm not sure about how the PS4 version would control on the Switch, but I could give an easy explanation.
-Docked? PS1- and Vita- games are held back by the PS4. The PS1 is not powerful enough in handheld mode to play in small bursts.
-Playing on a TV? PS4- and Vita- games are mostly played on handheld.
-The best way to play PS1 games is to play them constantly on the TV.
-Playing on a CRT? Switch is not a TV.
-I have a 3ds and Vita. I think the PS1 is better suited as an emulation device.
-I own the 3ds and Vita, but I don't know how well the PS4 version runs them.
-I have a PS1 classic on my 3rd console and I wouldn't recommend it to play them while having the active power cord.
-I think the PS1 versions of Nier and Shinobido are playable on the TV, but the PS Vita versions are playable on the Switch.
I'm not sure about the Switch version of Yakuza. I've read that the Switch version is better, but the PS4 version is playable.
-I prefer the 3D on the DS and the 3D on the PSP version of Yakuza.
-The PS4 version of Yakuza is not great. I've read that the controls are bad, but the game runs great on handheld.
-The PS4 version of Yakuza is not as good as the PS1 version.
-The 3D on the PSP version of Yakuza is better than the PS1 version.
-I think the PS4 version of Yakuza is better than the

~!~What games do you think will be the first to go mainstream?

MidnightCowboy: I was curious about what other popular franchises would go the first off the box, and I was surprised by the number of franchises that are considered AAA. Now I’ve got to admit that this may be an underestimating of Nintendo’s long term standing, but I feel like there have been a lot of franchises that have been dormant for a long time, but that just seem to go out of the top of my head.
I think that Star Wars will be the first AAA
-----
Kamiyouni: I think Insurgency: Korean War will be the first.
-----
Weiss: The Elder Scrolls and Fallout 4 are the obvious ones.
-----
Zippro: I think Halo will finally take that crown. The series' peak was World War II and there's no denying it.
-----
Troll: I am ready to see the series slowly decline. I’m ready for it to make its way up to the end but as a series I have little interest. Especially because it’s been 4 games now.
-----
Jawmuncher: I really hope Ubisoft takes this route. Do they still have an exclusives? If yes, more in depth analysis would be cool. 
Also for that matter, I think Gears of War will finally make it into the mainstream. It wouldn’t be a series I would pick up at a party while I was still playing it. Although I think I’d choose Gears 4.
-----
N.Domixis: With the way time has passed we have Halo and Destiny. I would not be surprised if EA took all their time in to the 2019 console iterations
-----
Samanosuke Akechi: I think Halo will easily become the first AAA Halo. I think Gears will be in the popular imagination. If it sells well, Halo and Gears will be back.
-----
Troll: I feel like Nintendo will have a good amount of franchises to push. Smash, Splatoon, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing.

-----
sam777: You can leave the DPad on the joycons and a mod will be given

-----
FiXalaS: That was great
I still need to play it
-----
swirlyglasses: beautiful video
-----
PlanetSmasher: The game is so good, but the final remix is so much better. The audio cues, the style of the music, so much more expressive. The way it ties in some background music into the main story and how different it is compared to other versions is just so incredibly awesome.
-----
Chocobo Blade: One of my fav Toyama games.
-----
CaviarMeths: I think this version's the best of the franchise in terms of atmosphere. Of the two, the original is a little bit more "anime" in the way it liberates and refocits on the main character. I think the new version is even more "anime" in just how much it refocits. I don't think it's as iconic as the "main" character's name, but it's still pretty awesome.

~!~What do you want from a sequel to Super Mario Maker 2?

ScOULaris: I've been playing this game a lot lately and I really like it. It's a great game that's highly customizable and full of options for you to experiment with the game and more than likely (and I assume) feature complete.
I'm a little concerned with what else the sequel could bring to the table that hasn't already been explored in the main Mario Maker game. The game's core gimmick is the "Maker", which is just a collection of levels of a given color palette that you can modify. The colors can be either bold (the colors can be reds or yellles) or bold (the colors can be reds or greens)
The tools are sleek and basic but the depth is incredible. I love playing with the maker and finding out what color combos are viable. It's super satisfying to see what color combinations you can make and get to play with the tools as a full blown maker.
I love how simple and intuitive the tools are to access. I love learning what specific colors and slopes are viable for. I love seeing how quickly I can make slopes and wildflowers on the overworld and just quickly going from there!
I also love the level editor. I'm not quite sure where to look for the TON technical info that I could get for a "make a level" mode but I'm hoping there are a few cool assets hidden away somewhere and I could even get a basic interface or program to show what color combos are viable for
The main problem I have with Super Mario Maker is that the difficulty is so mind-numbing and I'm not even sure I'm interested in how long it will take the game to get to the point of being enjoyable. I know it's a "Maker" game, but the structure and design of the levels just seem like chores to me. I just want to figure out how to make slopes and wildflowers without having to babysit the computer or programming!
-----
Flevance: Super Mario Maker 2 is so much better than the original, imo
-----
Gegz: I want this to be the game that finally made MGOGO into a game I was really interested in playing.
I want a new Mario maker, but not a watered down one with proper color combos.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think the game itself is great.

~!~What are some good games to play on the Switch?

snacknuts: Hi there! I'm just curious if there are any good, portable (console) games for the Switch? And if there are, would you recommend them? I know there are some handheld spin-offs of the Mega Drive, but I'm not sure if they're worth my time.
Personally I think Mega Drive is the best one, but if you have to pick one, I'd say go for Super Mario World or the Wii (maybe I'm misinterpreting this). They're both available on the eShop, and are very cheap.
-----
Theswweet: Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 and 2 are great.
-----
Nick Nehidnyk: Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation Dx2

~!~How do you feel about a Switch launching in 2020?

Phantom Thief: Tonight I the lively discussion and dreams-inducing thread topic of an hour and a half on how Nintendo announces and releases their games in the next few months. 
On one side we have the new hollow knight in the sky, announced at the end of the year. It’s a great game and the developers’ take pride in it, but what really made it stand out to me is how it’s currently announced and released. 
The game was going to be released in Japan during Christmas time, and was supposed to be out in February 2019. Instead, it’s out in Japan a few days later. I am not really sure what to think about this. 
On the other side we have the Pokémon game, announced today. 
I’m not really sure what this is at all, but it’s finally out in Japan and I’m excited to finally play it, after all I waited nearly two years and three newspapers to give it a read. 
I know Nintendo often has their announcements during E3, but I’m excited to have them ready for launch, before we get to playing it. 
What do you think? Do you think it’s a good game? Do you think it’s a bad game? 
I know in the end we’ll get a Super Mario game, but I’m not sure what.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think they’ll just drop the announcement and wait for the game to come out in America and then release it in Japan.
-----
StarPhlox: I think it's fine, Nintendo is great and a successful developer with their big releases.
-----
Dekuman: I think it's fine. 
I am glad they are supporting it.
-----
Phantom Thief: It’s a great game with many flaws. It’s a little bit better on Switch than many of the other great games we are getting. It’s not perfect, but I think it’s a game that can be played on a handheld device, and it’s 10 years old.

~!~Trying to get a refund for a Steam Controller fix because the fan keeps shivering

ItsBobby: I have never used a Steam controller, but after seeing how bad the fan is, and spending 30 seconds just looking at my games, I thought I should get a refund.
I am aware that a lot of people have issues with the fan, but I have never seen it so bad get over it so quickly.
I have tried several USB C ports to power it, but doesn't work at all, even if the fan is doing its job. All the ports are very underpowered to the point where I never even thought about using one.
I have tried resetting / power cycling but nothing seems to work.
The most recent issue is when I try on the Steam controller. It doesn't recognize the controller, but it tells me it has a power cycle and turns on the controller, but that doesn't work. I tried pressing the "reset" button three times but nothing works.
I tried holding down the Steam button for ten seconds, but nothing works.
I tried holding down the home down and splash screen for seven seconds but nothing works.
I tried holding down the home down and splash screen for two seconds, but nothing works.
I tried holding down the home down and splash screen for 30 seconds and nothing works.
The only thing that seems to work is holding the "energy limit" button which doesn't work. I tried to do the "restore the data" button but that doesn't work either.
I tried holding down the power button for four or five seconds but nothing works.
I tried holding down the home button for ten seconds but that doesn't work either.
I tried holding down the power button for fifteen seconds but that doesn't work either.
I tried holding down the home button for twenty seconds but that doesn't work either.
I tried holding down the power button for forty seconds, but that doesn't work either.
I tried four times before this happened but in fact I already played the game and not completely understand why it doesn't work.

~!~Why is there no option to use wired headphones on PC?

Mister Rain: I'm about to buy a new pair of wired headphones for my PS4 Pro (giving the earphone a full channel is much more important) and I'm wanting to know what wireless headphones are on offer? I've read that some companies like Black Jack have their own proprietary designs with a lot of mic integration. What's a good, cheap way of going about this?
-----
Nooblet: Avoid any headphones that have built-in mic integration, they're probably not worth the money.
-----
Mister Rain: I've used a lot of headphones and they've been a lot of fun. Black Jacks and Zosmic have the best sounding designs for me, but they're really expensive. I'm definitely in the market for a new pair of headphones to replace my PS4 Pro.
-----
I KILL PXLS: I'm pretty much on the same boat as you. I've been using the HX700 for the most part but a few pairs in the past have had some mic integration so I've been looking into them a bit.
-----
I KILL PXLS: I've heard that Sony's proprietary designs can cause problems. Black Jacks don't have an audio mic, but I've read that Microsoft has some issues with headphones that can interfere with the sound.
-----
I KILL PXLS: Black Jacks offer good sounding headphones, but with a bit of tweaking you can get some very loud mic integration. I've had some wirelessly connected headphones that had mic integration for years without any issues.

~!~A new Pokémon game made by a parent?

Giga Man: I've been thinking about this recently. I'm talking about with a TV (or someone in a household that buys a TV) a game about a Pokémon game on offer. I'm not talking about a remake of the original 151 (Pokémon Go is still the only Pokémon game on the system), I'm talking about a new game made specifically for the game.
I don't think this is a new Pokémon game that I've ever heard of, but something that was kind of new to me was the relationship between a parent and their child. The last time I heard of Pokemon Go, it was a quick n away by my parents. I wanted to be a kid again. My dad was convinced the game was for kids and wanted me to play it. I wasn't ready for it.
Now, I'm having a falling out with my kid, who is 8, he won't play video games but will let me control Pokemon. He has a Facebook account in English that I can't access (even though I can control both Pokemon and I can control Pokemon). I've heard that Game Freak banned the game, which is dumb. I don't want to risk his online reputation ruining a game I play.
I've been looking for some info about the game. Is there anything I can look for? Is there any reason for the ban? Is there a reason why is this game not out on the Switch? I know some parents were able to get their kids playing it, but it could also be that my son is older and he can't watch TV.
-----
Lant_War: It's not in the store, it's in the appstore.
-----
Kokonoe: Well I mean my son is almost 6 and my step son is a bit younger and he loves the game but would rather play with my dog.
-----
Phantom Thief: Maybe I should consider it a new Pokémon, since I’m not sure what its like in the real world lol
-----
Euler: It's a new Pokémon game.
-----
Giga Man: How do you mean? How does the app Store work and what do you mean by that? Did Nintendo ban the game? Could it have happened to his son? I mean, he's 6, he's playing a Gameboy, tablet and phone game, and if he didn't play it

~!~Can I just talk about the Switch's content without mentioning its 2D Adventure?

malyse: I mean, they're making the 3D Zelda, it's a fine game. I can understand they're making 2D Zelda, but there's a lot of stupid stuff that's going on behind the scenes there.
I understand the 3D Zelda has a lot of pointless padding, which is not excusable, but there's this stuff that I just can't think of. I'm talking about the lack of a straightforward and simple point and click adventure game.
I'm going to say this: There's a lot of games out there that simply aren't that good when it comes to exploration or storytelling, but sometimes they are a lot of fun.
I'm going to say this about the DQ games: they're fine, but there's a lot of pointless padding. 
I understand, this is just a quick and dirty way to say "hey listen here's a game I enjoy!" but I don't know. I haven't heard of a single one of these games that doesn't involve random dungeons crawling around square one-third of the map every time you're having a conversation with a random NPC.
Why is that? Is that something they're going for?
Edit: I was going to mention A Link Between Worlds instead, but I chose that one as it seemed to have a lot of content that isn't that out there.
-----
WadiumArcadium: I mean, you can't just say that because they're not made for the internet.
-----
daxy: You can't just post a list of all the games in your head and assume someone can blindly guess what's what. Just attribute some of the titles you find on search and expect a representative response.

-----
Fat4all: ive got a few spare questions
i've been itching to play something, but my tastes are very specific 
like is 3D Zelda good, or should I be fine with 2D?
if the latter I like the former, but I assume I'd have to get something 2D that adds depth to the combat.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: They're making 2d Zelda that involves exploration, but it is pretty straightforward, you don

~!~Trying to get into the Octopath Traveler demo

malyse: So I just finished my demo and now I'm trying my very best to stay on my good side. 
The game is available on all platforms, PC, Mobile, Switch, PS4, Mobile, and Steam. It's not a huge project either, more smaller stuff like tutorials or demo packs. I'm not a huge expert at anything, but I think it might be a good place to start.
The first thing that stood out to me was the writing. I can't recall any horror story with more straight to the point story than Octopath Traveler. I'm pretty sure there are some horror stories about the writing team, but I just can't think of anything else. The writers seemed very professional, and the writing seemed very good. I liked the overall idea of the game, but I can't remember much of it.
The writing was outstanding, and the experience was refreshing. It's a very unique experience, but at the same time, it's one that I care about a lot. I like the idea of the characters, the story, the characters, and the banter. Unfortunately, I've found that I'm a lot less interested in the story, and when I play the game, I find myself wanting to play a game that doesn't have a great story, and I don't care about that. I get that people like it, that's fine. But I don't find myself wanting to play a game with a bad story.
So...I'm trying my best to stay on my good side. I'm not rushing. I'm not rushing to play it. I'm not rushing to play it. I'm not rushing to be invested in it. I've found that the more I look at the game, the more I want to play it.
-----
Hiro Protagonest: It's a good game, but I'm not a huge fan of the characters and story.
-----
Namorange: I tried it once at launch. I’m currently playing through it and it’s pretty good. I was initially flabbergasted when I saw the password and I don’t have time to watch the cutscenes and more recently the chapters, but I am enjoying it so far.

Hero of Legend: I had a similar experience with Octopath Traveler. I played it originally

~!~LTTP: Dead Space. (Minor spoilers)

CharlesAznable: So I finally got to Dead Space and I loved it. It's a shame the Evil Within 1 is one of my favorite games ever. I have to say I found it boring.
The story was interesting enough in my head but I honestly couldn't figure it out. The only somewhat interesting thing about it was the aliens. I mean the good stuff about the aliens or stuff like that, but the bad things about it were not my favorite parts. It was still pretty much not good but it was still pretty fun.
I remember I got to free play and I was like "How did this game fuck itself" So I picked this up. I had to grind my way to save the fire, then I had to run around the whole city to free play and it was just... lame. The story was interesting and the setting and the atmosphere were all cool but It just just... was not interesting.
I just... fell in love with this game and actually really enjoy the game now.
I mean this game is a masterpiece. The atmosphere is truly magical and the controls are sublime. The gunplay is sublime, the enemy and environment design is top notch and the atmosphere is just incredible. I actually think this is the first best game in the series to have a good gunplay and the implementation of it is phenomenal.
It's a shame this game got left unfinished. I really hope we get another good game someday.
-----
Lannisters1798: I got it on sale during the Steam sale and played it. I loved the first two games, but this one just felt... soully? It felt like trying to take my time with a generic FPS and exploring the Firefly table. 
I think it's worth getting, but I didn't really want to pay full price for it.
-----
CharlesAznable: No problem!
-----
Sou Da: I remember being interested in this game back when it was a PS+ game. Wasn't bad by me.
-----
RumbleHumble: The first game was a pretty fun time, but I didn't think I'd ever finish it. I should probably just give it another try.

~!~would you buy a physical Switch without docking/raising the battery?

Aprikurt: My sister is having a stroke and is using me for her treatment. I'm in intensive treatments and it's only a few hours of time before my body can handle more intensive exercise... so, yeah, I'd probably need to go physical.
I just don't see myself having that issue with PS4 Pro and Switch.
-----
Bigg: Not to beat a dead horse, but if I have a spare battery I could still consider it.
-----
Unknownlight: Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm not planning to get a Switch with a battery. I've already considered that, but not yet. I can afford that at $200-$250 range though.
-----
Renna Hazel: I've had a Switch for about a year now and have no issues with it. I'll probably still buy it for $100 once my treatment ends so I'm good.
-----
Mindfreak191: If I had a spare battery I'd definitely go physical.
-----
DarthWalden: I still have a couple hours in and it's fine. I have a few games I'd like to play, but I just end up buying them digitally, so I don't really feel like playing them physically.
Edit: To be absolutely clear, I don't think I ever bought a console without docking/raising the battery.

~!~Should I play the original or Red Dead Redemption on Nintendo Switch?

ADee: I played the original on Wii U and it was great but I never played the remake on Switch. 
I tried it on PS4 and N64 but I feel like I would be missing out. Is there an official way to get it on Switch?
If I play it on Wii U would I be able to enjoy it on Switch?
I have a Switch but never played the original on Wii
-----
Cerium: In a sense, yes. For both, but they're completely different games.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: The original is better, play it on the Wii U, but i remember you can skip the pikmin game and the mad dog
-----
Jazzem: Lol, yes, the original is much better but is much more fun and the second one is a more linear adventure and the story is a bit more flamboyant. Still worth it though.
-----
MadMike: They're both good games, but they're totally different.
-----
Cartridge Games: I don’t think they are comparable.
If you want to play it on Wii U, just buy the digital switch version.
If you want to play it on Switch, the physical switch version is pretty different too.
-----
Cartridge Games: First ones are pretty different.
RDR2 is basically an RTS on the Wii U with a racing kart, but with a massive focus on open world segments, whereas the original is basically a GTA clone with a big open world.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: i think you can skip the mad dog, but only if you want a bit more of the chalice spirit and some chalice lake
-----
Remo Williams: They're both pretty different, I wouldn't really need to say they are comparable.
-----
Cartridge Games: First one is pretty different.
The second one is a straight up romp, while the first one is more linear.
They both have a “open world” mode, which is basically GTA, but with a much more linear approach and story.

J_ToSaveTheDay: Yeah, I'm not sure I ever actually liked the Platinum level. It was a level that just... was fun to go through, too. But it didn't have this much spark to it, or it had less of an impact on me than any of the other levels (the second one I played was incredible, though).

~!~Opinion : The Zelda Timeline is a lie

Phantom Thief: THE LEGEND HAS ARRIVED
Spoiler
"But, we can't be like this... and indeed... this is the timeline..."
Now granted, the timeline is a lie. Yes, the game is set in the past, and yet, Zelda has never been based on the timeline. The events of Majora's Mask and Skyward Sword are set in the present, but Link and Zelda have never been based on the timeline.
The timeline is a lie. It's the game's original plot, and it's happening to these characters based on minor characters, and then to the story they're based on in the present timeline.
It's a lie really. The games are set in the present, and yet, they're all aware of and in reference with the events of Majora's Mask. And, no, you cannot like this.
It's as simple as that. Yes, Majora's Mask had my favorite timeline, and I loved it. But, as a game's timeline, It's utterly nonsensical.
It's also false and, frankly, really confusing. You can't love Majora's Mask. But, having seen the games, and comparing them to the reality of Majora's Mask, you cannot.
What I want to talk about, however, is the story and characters that were there.
The Phantom Thieves are a group of people that have a story about Majora's Mask and the Zelda timeline.
The Phantom Thieves are the members of the Phantom Thieves group who were in the present, but were completely unaware of and in reference with the events of Majora's Mask. The Phantom Thieves are the members of the Phantom Thieves group who were in the present, but were completely unaware of and in reference with the events of Majora's Mask.
The Phantom Thieves are not members of the Phantom Thieves group. The Phantom Thieves are not members of the Phantom Thieves group.

~!~Is buying digital codes for games on Humble Bundle still a viable option?

Raster: The last I checked, there's no way to get a physical copy of a physical game without directly buying the game from there. I did find way to buy the Humble bundle from some of the older sites when it came out and resell it when it went on sale, but usually you just sweep everything. Is there a way to get a copy of the Humble Bundle when buying digitally? I remember reading that it was free, but it was literally just a download code, and I don't know if that's true or not.
I'm just curious if there's still some option to just buy the games off Humble and if it's a viable option to simply keep them for the library, or if I should just buy a physical game for that or something else entirely if I don't want to hook up a multiple day plan to play it?
Also, I have a physical Commodore 64 copy of AC:

~!~[RUMOR] Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Character Leaked: Goku Black

Neoxon: I think this is a legit source (according to Reddit). I know it's a guess, but it's pretty much 100% Smash's fault for not updating the Smash Bros. website well before it was taken down (via Wccftech), and that Nintendo probably didn't think it was worth taking down before they took down the Smash Bros. website.
For reference, here's the Smash.com listing for the character:
-----
FiXalaS: I'm not sure if it's reliable but someone leaked smash and was leaked legit.
-----
NintenDuvo08: how did someone get in before they were done lol

Cybersai: If this is real then why is Goku black? Why is it black when the Wada is red?

Imran: Who knows? I'm not sure how reliable this is but this is some nutty stuff.
-----
Sega Dreamcast: Please be real.
-----
JimJamJones: Goku Black is Goku Black.
-----
Neoxon: If this is legit, then Wada's real name is Ashuma, which translates to “Legendary” in English.

I checked the settings and noticed that they are not even showing the HDR option. I checked the options and it's disabled. I checked out of curiosity the fact that the game uses it but looks muted and washed out.
Has anyone else noticed what this is? Anyone else feel this is a deal breaker?
-----
Xenex: I thought it was disabled as well?
-----
Orayn: I think it's on the individual options and not just the individual tools.

TheFallenSaboteur: I honestly think the game looks washed out in the PC version, it really doesn't look that washed out. I don't think it's something you have to enable.

~!~Are you using a DS4 pro for the Nintendo Switch?

Hawk269: I am looking to purchase a Nintendo Switch for the Nintendo Switch Online service. 
I have heard from a few others in the know the issues that a DS4 pro can have with it. 
I am looking for some help to troubleshoot this. 
I have a launch model of the DS4 and a launch pro model of the DS4. 
I am wanting to buy both, but would prefer to find a solution that will not require the removal of the power cord whilst retaining the functionality of a dual shock 4 controller. 
I know most of the pro controller owners have been happy with the controller, but I have also heard that people say that the trigger locks sometimes and that moving the stick on the analogue stick makes it less practical. 
I am looking at the two DS4 controllers with the 2.5 inch models. 
I am looking at the bluetooth dongle (I am unsure if it is wired or not) and am quite interested in the wireless options. 
I am just looking for a more reliable option.
-----
CeroMiedo: Should be in the direct mode and working fine
-----
NintendoNinjaNews: Please find a model and test out, what receiver do you have?
-----
Cyryus: The DS4 Pro is a new model and might require some tinkering. I got mine from.

Any idea if it’s wireless?

Mechaplum: I have 2.5" models and this one has the bluetooth support. I will be using it wirelessly on PC.

catpurrcope: Yeah, this is a good place to start. The DS4 has some connection issues that I would rather fix. The DS4 controllers have some issues that are listed as “wifi is” in the direct mode. 
I have the DS4 pro installed and it’s working fine.

~!~What's the best way to play MP games on the Switch?

mogster7777: i just purchased Mario Tennis Aces for the switch and it’s the best multiplayer game for the system (no MTs) and i found it hard but that’s not my cup of tea. I’m only about 15 hours in but this is one of those games where you can play with buddies and have fun. I don’t own a Switch so I can’t really compare it to other games but it’s one of the best multiplayer games for the switch and it’s a blast.
Is there a good way to play it?
I just purchased Mario and Rabbids last week and i can’t believe how much fun it is. I have friends that played MP games with me on it and it’s a blast.
Is there any other good MP games on Switch besides Mario Tennis?
Is there any good singleplayer games that are essentially singleplayer?

Jawmuncher: Still a little worried about the build quality for these types of things. I'll say that seems like a significant and long road trip for an AAA game.
-----
Dancrane212: The PC build was already great.
-----
Theorry: Dont underestimate what happened with Halo 6.
-----
Norton F: I'm still concerned about the build quality.
-----
elzeus: Still too low on the XB1X.
-----
Waffle: I really hope they can get this run down at some point.
-----
Ricker: This was fun for a few months,this time the team is doing really well for a studio of 343,we need more halo and the halo franchise...stuff feels off now,no hvp in the pc version,no hqc,no hps yet.
-----
Dancrane212: The Halo 6 build was done by the same team that worked on Forge.

~!~Next Gen: Where should the price and performance hit console versions?

IbizaPocholo: With the news of Nintendo Switch Online coming to stores today, I wanted to give a chance some thought to those who have had their hands in the service and have mixed or spoiled expectations with the launch of the service for a long time.
Since the announcement of Splatoon 2, the number of threads made on here (that is, threads that refer to the current console iteration as or are primarily written about it) have seemed to have increased considerably with new threads, giving me some time to think about the differences between the various services and how they might be applied in a future console generation. New threads are posted about the differing opinions of users on the viability of the service, different timelines, what can be done to help enable users to move on from the current issues, and the interesting perspectives on prioritising console upgrades over a possible Switch refresh.
So, to make things clear:
Consumers who buy a game on the Xbox Game Pass or Switch can download the new version of the game to any console, whether it be Steam, Mobile, PC or otherwise, as long as you have an Xbox Account.
You cannot create an account on a certain platform for any reason other than to play an online game.
The following terms and conditions apply to any title you purchase:
You must have an active subscription to play the title.
You cannot purchase a game for more than one (1) game per year. (2) Subscribers may choose to purchase any game in any calendar year.
You cannot purchase any game, including sequels or spin-offs, by using or with an unlicensed game. (3) The use of unlicensed game for any reason other than to release the title.
You must have an active subscription to play any game. (4) The use of a third party service for your active subscription expires at 11:59 p.m. (5) If on or after October 1, 2018, you purchase a game on or after that date, you must continue access to the title. (6) For title maintenance, you may continue to access or request a postponement from the date of release. (7) If you purchase a game, or request a postponement from the date, the publisher shall immediately pay all claims to be paid as reasonably necessary.
(8) In the event of cancelations, you must

~!~I'm now playing KH3: Do I really need to clean up KH3?

The Last One: I remember when KH3 was announced, I was excited that they were finally going back to traditional Disney worlds after all the bullshit they had to do between 2 and 3. Then they announced the other Disney worlds which got priority. Now I'm not a KH fan but I feel like I should save them for a final time so I can play it. Right now I don't even know if I should go back to the Kingdom Hearts series or if I should wait until the ReMake later this year.
-----
Aprikurt: I’m sure you don’t.
-----
KZXcellent: Play the game.
-----
mrmickfran: I'm not a fan at all. Shoulda been back to basics
-----
ASaiyan: It's one of the biggest games of the year. Pick it up.
-----
KZXcellent: I mean, they're generally done nowadays and they're not perfect, but playing it feels like the PS1-era to me.
-----
The Last One: I mean, of course I should not.
I feel like I should
-----
MouldyK: Just play it.
If you don’t like it, you don’t.
-----
KZXcellent: The game is very casual friendly compared to the previous games though.
-----
The Last One: I'm old enough to remember when the ps1 games were very casual and demanding.

~!~Overwatch Ultimates Ultimate Preview: Picking Hopes and Ants for Reverence

NeoRaider: The Overwatch Ultimates are the only Overwatch IP that I'm interested in.
- Picked up Blizzard for a beta, but never bought it.
- Bought it for the beta and never played it.
- Never played the game, not even most of the beta.
- Never played the game, but I was interested in playing it.
- I got to the point where I just ignore everything about Overwatch, and play the default and try to get a new skin.
Now, I just don't care about the Ultimates.
- I get the impression that they aren't very interesting to play. Not particularly complex, not particularly powerful, not particularly fun to watch.
- They don't really appeal to me, and I don't know that they make sense.
- I'm aware that it has the typical Overwatch Hero system, but I don't really know if that's something that I can get into.
- It just doesn't have the appeal of those other popular IPs. I'd like to hear more about those though if they're interesting.
- I'm playing the game, and the characters are all pretty good.
- I like playing overwatch.
- I'm a pretty big hero shooter fan. Most of the heroes in this game are overwatch heroes.
- I can't remember if there's an Ultimatum for when Overwatch will be back or not. I don't remember any different than there is for years.
- I really enjoy watching R6, but I haven't played this game in a long time.
- The game looks beautiful.
- I have a good friend that plays the game, but I didn't even play it.
- I would like to play it more if possible.
- I would like to play with a friend, but I can't.
- I know I'm not a good player, but I really enjoy playing with my friends.
- I would prefer to play the game if there's no Ultimatum.
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: I'm pretty hyped for Ultimax, but I really hope they don't go the UltIMAXA route of just releasing the game again. I'd love to get a beta code, but I'm pretty sure they're going for the same strat

~!~The 3D D Scrolling Detective

Ametroid: I always thought the 3D was the future of 3D and it's crazy to think Nintendo is throwing these games to all the different tv's and computers simultaneously. 
The games that got both the handheld and console versions and were the most nostalgic and engaging ones.
-----
Tyrant Rave: I think it's the very best you can play. I remember thinking it was very impressive at first. It's not a bad game, just not a great 3D game with fantastic levels and animation.
-----

Ametroid: No i think the controls are great and the game is perfect for it
-----
ShiningSolaris: I never found the 3D to be simply enjoyable. I think it has some great ideas but doesn’t really offer anything that impressive or engaging. 
This is why I’m not sure it would be for me.
-----
ASaiyan: I really like the game. I'd give it a 9/10 but watching a friend play through it the last time I was really blown away by how good the game was. It's so good, you'd swear it was the best 3D game in years.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: The game is fantastic.
-----
sir_crocodile: nice, I loved it
-----
Tyrant Rave: I only wish it was a tad more indelegant in terms of controls. It's a fantastic game

Neoxon: I figured this was worth sharing. In addition to the Cody, Lei is going to be the tag team player you'll be fighting.

Jawmuncher: I love these videos. Glad more people are exposed to it.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: oh man the hype is real!
-----
LordKano: whew it's so good there's been alot of new info already.
-----
Neoxon: I think a lot of the fan reactions to the new Mishima teased after watching the Mishima Collection JP stream in December were reactions to the new Mishima, not necessarily of particular interest. I guess the Mishima Collection reaction was a little too much given the Mishima himself is a fan favourite.
-----
Neoxon: The Mishima Collection reaction is short lived, it's now a limited run amoung new Mishima.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: oh gosh the way they had the Mishima reaction, that's so great, I never expected a Mishima game anyway
-----
Neoxon: Yeah, the Mishima tweet is pretty much it!
I guess the Mishima Collection reaction was a little too much given the Mishima himself is a fan favourite.

~!~What do you want out of a new western media series?

CannonFodder52: In the wake of the recent success of the self published games, it's fair to say that the western industry has seen a rather thin representation of its own.
For many, the most iconic games of the 90's haven't actually been commercially viable.
The witcher of steel is a game that was ignored by the western mainstream but still manages to have a successful critical and commercial reception.
In the case of Fallout, the only other series that has done well for itself is Final Fantasy. Even then, the company's western marketing has been dominated by Bethesda, with a few exceptions.
With the recent success of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout, Bethesda has been handed back to the basement and re-rereleased on PC but with the exact same issues.
I personally think that the next big Western publisher for the time being should be 505 Games. They would be well on their feet if they just took the ideas from the 1983 and started from there.
I'd love to see a new take on the western series.
-----
Aokiji: I mean, if they had to take something away from it, it’s putting it in the wrong games. Like, you can’t just make a PSTV game and mock Perfect Dark as the art and subtitle to a Star Wars game. As far as engaging primarily with the story, gameplay and the like, they need to take that lesson and make something new.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: NIS America.
-----
vestan: NISA.
I'd love a new Disgaea, but I'd prefer Disgaea Central.
-----
Suikodan: I'm not even sure I like PSTV games. It's really hard to get my head around it.
I'm hoping for a new IP instead, but I need to wait another year or so.
-----
SieteBlanco: I don't have much to add but I'd love a new IP by NISA, one that goes beyond what Kingdom Hearts is trying to offer.
-----
Aters: I would like to see NIS do a new Disgaea.
-----
Fat4all: i’ll be happy with a new 2D Disgaea

~!~Convince a National Basketball Association

MouldyK: The 2018 Hoops Era Tournament was the first time I remember watching a National Basketball Association game. The last time I watched a NBA game was back in the first grade on the 360.
I don’t know if I have ever seen a National Basketball Association game, but I find this pretty fascinating.
I think this makes me think about the whole NBAABA thing in general and how it is all just to promote one particular brand but also a push for one specific players to some specific marketing agency.
I think this is the first time I am seeing this in action in an EA or Ubisoft title.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think people like the concept. 
Probably in tact to promote something they feel gets people interested.
Think of the teams of those teams and how the players would interact with them.
-----
Phantom Thief: That's silly, but I thought this was pretty clever.
-----
Outrun: He's asking the NBA to do an "NBA" or "NFL" type of thing.
-----
MouldyK: I think.
I have heard that this was done to promote a specific franchise.
And I was confused too.
-----
Skronk: This is pretty clever. I wonder why EA and publishers don't just take a page off the books and do something cool.
-----
Rogue: This is pretty clever, but it's not the most interesting way to market the game.
-----
DannyClash: I'm a fan of the concept and thought it was stupid to highlight a specific franchise
-----
Chaz: This is pretty neat, very curious.
-----
Kouriozan: This is the most interesting thing I’ve seen in a long time.

~!~What is the best version of KH 2.8 at the moment?

ItWasMeantToBe19: So here is the question: what is the best version of KH 2.8 at the moment?
I have no real favorite versions of the games but I can't think of one that I like the best. Kingdom Hearts 2 is my recent favorite and KH3 is the only game I've played a significant amount of the time that I can remember.
-----
Regulus Tera: Kingdom Hearts 2.8 is the best version.
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: I mean, look at this:
The best version of KH2 is probably the original, but I mean, I don't remember the game being so damn hard and demanding while the other versions are well optimized and easy to learn how to play, so I would just say go for it. I'm not sure if you can really replicate that experience in KH3 though.
-----
PhantomKnight: KH2.8 is my go to.
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: Is Kingdom Hearts 2.8 in development or is it already confirmed to be a new version of KH1.
-----
Hailinel: I've only played KH1 (Hearing/reading about the gameplay), but I recall thinking it was good, at least.
-----
PhantomKnight: I think it's a perfect match for KH2, it's an absolutely amazing game and it feels like the best in the series.
I would say it's the easiest of the three versions though, it's basically just play the cutscene and cut dialogue (the KH1 cutscenes).
-----
ItWasMeantToBe19: Ah yeah I forgot about that.
It was a mix of the 2nd and 3rd movies, but the story in the end seems to be pretty interesting.
-----
RyoonZ: KH 2.8 is my #3.
-----
Rygar 8Bit: The cutscenes don't hold up as well as KH2 but it's still worth even if you are into the series.

~!~Should I buy Valkyria Chronicles 4?

SofNascimento: I have the game pre-ordered and undecided on. I've been having a blast with it and I'm in the mood to play it.
I have a PS4 and really like my PS2 but I have a TV.
I'm very interested in the game. 
I've heard that VC4 is pretty bad and I'm wondering if that's true.
-----
Kamiyouni: No.
-----
Cess007: No. I like the game but I don't have a TV.
-----
darkside: Yes... I mean VC1 was pretty bad, VC4 was pretty good. I haven't played it yet though, I'm waiting for the Switch port first.
-----
Brazil: VC1 on the PS2 is a fine game, and the VC4 remake is a different story. But it is a game that is a lot of fun to play.
-----
DarkChronic: Fantastic game, but I'm still waiting for the Switch version. But yeah, play VC4.
-----
yuoke: It was good.
Not sure about the gameplay wise, but it was pretty good.
-----
The era of Luigi: I hope you don't have any knowledge of the franchise
-----
M1chl: Must be...my dream VC, I want to play it, but I want to wait for the Switch version.
-----
SofNascimento: I've been a fan of it, but it's also on PS4 as well.

~!~Would you have preferred a new fighting game character? (Interview)

TheGamingNewsGuy: With the Playstation 4 game awards about to start and now have a time limit for announcements, I thought it would be good to bring up a question that I thought was pretty common amongst fighting game fans but I haven't see a lot of responses in the article or in the thread.
Of the recent rumors, the most common answers are that of Ren(VR game) and M(AR game).
However with the release of the Playstation 4 games, and with the interviewer asking about new characters in the series, would you have preferred a newcomer fighter from a franchise you have long been most against, and would you have preferred a game from Nintendo greenlighting a new entry in the series, well, maybe I am leaving it at that? I know a few of these examples are coming up, I am just wondering which one you think would have been better.
Personally, I would have preferred a newcomer fighter from a franchise, given how much more depth the current roster has, but I guess I am not the smartest guy at all.
What about you guys?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I don't need to answer in detail but I think that it would be a really good idea to just engage people in a discussion on what the current stand outs should have been. The current stand ups are very diverse and have a ton of interesting options to choose from. Right now you can watch them on Twitch and immerse yourself in the storyline.
Maybe even just see a fighting game from the top of my head.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The only fighter I had interest in was bayonetta from who knows tech-jr. I've wanted to try it out. I think its safe, but it would be a waste of time.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah I would love to see that. I always play fighting games on the PS4 and would honestly love a little more depth and depth than that. I really like the concept of playing as characters and I thought it would be cool to take on a story and have different abilities and movesets than in other fighters
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I agree, I have played a bit of SFV but not really in the depth that I would like in a fighting game, I think I want to learn how to juggle and combos. I would have liked to see

~!~What is the worst game you have ever played?

TheWordyGuy: For me it’s this
This was the last game I played before I had to look up a guide and I got stuck at some point with no plans and I think I’m done with it.
Didn’t get a chance to finish it myself, but I did play it a few months ago.
What is the worst game you’ve played?
-----
TheWordyGuy: I don’t think it’s the worst game I’ve ever played. It’s got plenty of charm, but there’s a lot of trial and error that I don’t think is necessary.
-----
ASaiyan: The only game that had a legit horror soundtrack was The Evil Within 2.
-----
Euler: The only game that has soundtrack quality wise that I could listen to for hours was Final Fantasy XI.
-----
Maxina: I don't have the courage to play horror games but I played Prey and Dishonored 2 in VR. Both were gorgeous games.
-----
Yggfk: Not sure which one but I believe I can reach the top 10 in the former.
-----
Wander: The best game of all time is The Evil Within 2
-----
TheWordyGuy: I’m not sure which is the worst game I’ve ever played.
I don’t think it’s the best game ever made, but I’ll take horror over the likes of Diablo 3 and Silent Hill 2.
-----
Stiler: I don't think the best horror game is The Evil Within 2, it's not that bad and not that remarkable (if anything, it's better than most fps games imo) and so on, but it has some flaws and as I've mentioned in the OP, its amazing.

~!~The Quiet Man (2019) is now available on Steam

Durante: I can't find a thread for this game, so I'll just compile a list of the promotional campaigns it had in the past few weeks.
I've only just started a few minutes ago, but I think it's worth discussing about, because many other publishers have already done this by now.
I've had my eye on this game for a good while, and I'm really excited to play it :)
It's currently $34.99 from Theatrical.com. Price is currently $39.99 MSRP, so I did it my first time.
The "Three-part ad" breaks up the story in a big way, which I think is a very positive thing to do.
The game also has a demo available:
The whole thing starts at the opening of the demo.
It also has a Steam page:
-----
Sir Guts: I still have my disc. I can’t wait to try it out
-----
Slicer Dyster: I'm really excited for this!
-----
Durante: True. I wonder how long it will take to get to the point where I'll be able to play it in English.
-----
Mifec: What the fuck
-----
FantasticMrFoxdie: I'm so ready for this game.
Fuck Konami
-----

SCB360: That's a good price, I'll grab it
-----
SCB360: I'll prob play with the demo on Steam, but I'll be out of interest if the price's close to that
-----
illamap: It's a great game but the combat is bad, I would have liked to see a different combat system or try out a different mode.

They also are not for up to October 2018. I don't understand why. Has Sony been ignoring them for the last few months?

CormoranStrike: on PS3, you can just redeem the code with the 2 stars icon and the renewal will come for you.

CormoranStrike: Actually, they are for the PS3 version only, but you can also just use the code to add you to a club and get the PS4 version.

Kamagii: They are for the PS3 version only, but you can also just use the code to add you to a club and get the PS4 version.

~!~H1Z1VR: The first real VR survival horror game on PC

ghostcrew: It's h1z1vr.the first real VR survival game on PC. It's a survival horror game, not a VR game. It's not a survival horror game. It's a survival game.
It's been out for 6 months and it's still in Early Access.
The game has a PvP mode.
Its basically a PVP survival game with a horde mode.
Its basically a PVE survival game with a co-op mode.
Its essentially a co-op survival game with the PvP mode being used for destruction.
The game has maps and the PvP mode is what I find the most interesting.
I don't know if this is a good game, haven't played it myself but it's a very unique experience.
Here's the trailer.

~!~Would you pay $60 for a new GTA game on next-gen consoles?

Joshg27: GTAV was on sale for $20 at Best Buy for the first time and I'm tempted by the chance of getting a GTA game on my PS4.
However, I'm not sure if I should get a new GTA, I miss the past of this generation so much.
I'm sure I'll be playing the same old GTA with all the mods and upgrades and all the new buildings out the new release.
But I'd be curious to know if this would be worth my money.
I know I'd get GTA V for sure, mostly.
-----
Cess007: I would, but I think that GTAV has moved on from the formula that everyone know was the first.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: How many
I mean
The hype that was the RDR2 trailer was enough to carry me to buy it
And I haven't played the new GTA in a looooong time
-----
Kolx: Why not.
-----
Piston: It would be $50 for a GTA game on next-gen consoles.
-----
Sloane Ranger: I'd have been all over this, but I was too preoccupied with RDR2 to even consider passing on it.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: No, I don't want a GTA game on next-gen consoles.
-----
Flux: Nah, I'm there day 1.

~!~Rumor: Switch version of Resident Evil 7 confirmed to release in Japan on August 31st

Jawmuncher: Searched and did nothing. So I thought I'd post this here to share.
I've only seen a small number of this thread on Era. So, if anyone else is a big fan and want to discuss this, please PM me.
Regardless of when the game is actually released or not, I think it's pretty clear the title is coming. There's a few things to note here.
Next to no footage, there's no gameplay. That's a lot.
There's a new trailer already.
First of all, this is the release date. This is the release date for the localization of the game.
Now, for the negatives to this thread. Resident Evil 7 is a fantastic game. I think it is highly likely that it will be the type of game that will get patched and released on August 31st. When there's not a lot of time to make a game nowadays, it's likely this will be the title. If it doesn't happen, that's fair enough.
-----
ILikeFeet: that's a good thing. the gameplay doesn't look too bad
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Well it's not that much anyway
-----
rude: If the game actually releases on other days than August I'm not sure I'd bother to hold off until the game is finished.
-----
Sebastopa: The hype for this game is simply insane, I've been waiting for the release date for ages.
-----
Jawmuncher: I’ve seen a fair amount of posts here on Era since it was originally posted that the game is coming out this week. Here’s where you go.
I’d be surprised if this game is in the final day of development.
-----
Cybersai: At this point, what's the point in having a game in development?
-----
ASilentProtagonist: It's a 2019 title. It's a remake of a PC game.
-----
Tibarn: It's not really relevant, as most people are still playing RE7.
I can understand why they decided to delay the game, but the fact that it's so close to launch makes me worry for the game.
-----
Tibarn: Also, I would advise against watching

~!~Should Nintendo release a "Smash" Collection of its own?

Jarmusch: I mean, it would be nice if we could get a compilation of all the SMB's and other series in one big console with the full potential of the platform. 
Folks, we are not getting Ultimate NES on Switch.
-----
FiXalaS: No thanks, I want more like the original and not the OG

Aigis: I want it, I just want it and I think it’s in the best selling series of all time now

~!~Why is the crossplay so bad in Fortnite?

Buddeh: I love Fortnite, but I'm not a Fortnite fan, and I just don't really enjoy the crossplay aspect.
Is there anything fortnite-related I should know?
-----
Zappy: I just don't understand the Fortnite hate. It's a new thing and it's a new mode. Like the game itself. 
I don't know if I like it or hate it. Maybe the crossplay is just a thing that was broken before?
-----
bananafactory: I hate it.
I will not support a crossplay provider btw.
-----
Cubas: Why is this a problem with Nintendo and Microsoft, not Sony and Nintendo? It's hard to say.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I'm not a fan of crossplay by any means but I love playing a game with friends.
-----
bananafactory: It's ok to be a bad guy on the PS side
-----
Cess007: I think it's because it's not a popular game. I bought Fortnite for a month and play for a few hours, but never have an issue
-----
Cartridge Games: It’s a free service to the community.
-----
Gentlemen: It's a free-to-play game with a small community. It's all about community.
-----
mazi: i've played the game for a year and i'm not even a big fan, and i don't really play it anymore. i bought the game on the Switch for a few reasons:
1. i wanted a game i could play with my friends, and i got it.
2. because its a free game, and i dont care about crossplay, and i played on PC for a year and still had no issues (plus i could play with my brother)
3. because crossplay is not an issue for the most hardcore users who like to horde over people on the platform, crossplay is a game for competitive players who want to be sure every other platform has at least one.

~!~How to start and keep up with more Nintendo news?

TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I've been in Nintendo forums for over a decade and they are particularly tight on news. However, it never ceases to blow my mind as I sometimes see it used as a reason to be excited about a game coming to the Switch but when I see something new about it, it's a week later, I have no idea what it is, when it comes out, plays well, etc. It's a weird thing to be stuck with.
Any advice that I need to impart to someone new is to follow the Nintendo news on YouTube. On that channel, you can see the best and the best covers. In Nintendo forums, you can find the most obscure and interesting videos, the most obscure Switch game, the most obscure video essays. I've recently been watching a lot of videos on Nintendo websites like this, and I think the videos are really well done but they're still challenging, spoiler-filled and have a sense of "highlight" or something. I had a look at some of the videos on the channel and they all feel like they're going to be a challenge but I don't have any experience with Nintendo games, I'm just following the news on YouTube and seeing what other people suggest. 
So, I don't want to be missing out on anything, I just want to know if there are any strategies you can use to keep up to date and keep up to read what's new and what's coming out on the Switch and what's coming to the Switch gaming landscape. 
I'm sure there are a lot of Nintendo news that I've followed and have followed for many years, mainly because of the news that leak's pop up all the time. I love Nintendo news and I'm always in a state of shock about the news that Nintendo has met its commitments to us and what the situation can bring. 
I'm not a huge Nintendo guy so I'm always intrigued by the news, the updates, the updates on the upcoming games etc. However, I did notice a lack of Switch news this time and I thought I'd take a look at the topics and potential future announcements. 
So era, what are your thoughts on the topic of Switch news and Nintendo news?

====================
~!~Why is racing games so dead?

Thewonandonly: My only solace in life is that every game I play has been a very different experience from what I used to play growing up. I had Mario Kart, Rocket League, Street Fighter, Doom, Skyrim, Titanfall 2, Octopath Traveller, and Uncharted Waters. All of them have been experiences that really grabbed my (troubled) young mind. 
I was born in the 80s. I grew up and never really experienced myself. When I was young I thought I was going to have fun. Then when I was in high school my friends introduced me to Street Fighter and I was in shock. 
Then I went home and got a job and now I am a part time PC gamer. 
I am not sure why it took so long to go back to what used to be. When I was at high school I used to play a lot of fighting games. 
Now I am in college and my roommates are not really into video games beyond Smash Brothers. I know I have no choice to play games. 
The reason why it took so long to get back to the youth me personally was because my family was in the 90s when I was growing up. They were getting older. 
They wanted me just growing up. They didn't have time for me. 
So I was looking for a hobby that I can just play and they offered a meetup at my place and they had me play Street Fighter 2 and 2 Strike with people but that was it. I knew that I could just get myself out of the situation and go out on my own and enjoy my time. I did a lot for free and it was a lot of fun. 
Now that I have a job I can pay for something I reasonably and research for a bit and have a better lifestyle I can live a better life. But that doesn't mean that I have to "grind" for games. I have to pay for everything. I paid for a new car, a new house, rent, a mortgage, ect. 
I just wanted to be with my family and play games. 
I want to feel like I have complete freedom to make my own decision and be happy.

Master Chuuster: I'm not sure I could say "grind." I mean, I'm not the type of person to say "I feel like I

~!~The Witcher has some of the best lore I've seen in a game, ever

JaeCryo: I've been a huge fan of the Witcher franchise for a number of years. I've played through all of the books, completed all of the expansions, played through all of the novels, completed all of the side quests, all of the main quest storylines, and it's an absolute delight to look at all of those lore dumps. I've been curious about what people might pick up on during these months of busy looking back at it's life, and I thought it'd be fun to see what you folks have enjoyed when you last played it.
What's the general consensus on the Witcher 3 and its world? What did you think of it as a game, and what did you think about it as a series?
-----
Ahasverus: I didn't to finish it for the reasons you mentioned.
-----
Lichtsang: I was never that interested in the Witcher series, but the first game is really good, and I absolutely love the world. The story is interesting, the characters are interesting, and the mysteries solved are fantastic.
-----
Tibarn: I really enjoyed it, but I only played about 1-2 hours and it had issues. The writing was ok, the voice acting was ok, but nothing special.
I really liked the freedom of movement in combat, and I really liked that Geralt wanted to follow the Sword in Amantium, I felt like a badass in that.
The world is fascinating, and the characters are great, but they're not for everyone.
-----
leng jai: The writing/characters were pretty meh for me. The whole "troll" vibe was annoying but entertaining.
-----
Enduin: I enjoyed it, but it definitely had its share of issues. The main story was interesting, but I found the way the game progressed and the side quests were rather dull, I would probably have preferred a more narrative style. Still a fantastic game and definitely has my favorite writing of the last 5 years.
-----
Isukarn: I liked the writing in the first game. The way Geralt tricked people and their respect for normal humans was a really good action rpg. It made every conversation between the two could be something incredible.
-----
Breqesk: I haven't played The Witcher series at all,

~!~Recommend me some good PS1 era PSone games

*Guaraná: So, i wanted to buy a PS1 back in the day (i remember when psone first came out) but, i couldn't find many games for it and, even then, i couldn't find a solid list of PS1 games.
So, the Playstation 1 era happened and i wasn't really sure what to buy, specially in the UK. so, i decided to look for a good PS1 games to buy, and, i found a lot of PS1 games available in EU PSN.
Some interesting ones:
Metal Gear Solid 1 & 2
Metal Gear Solid
Psychonauts
Jeanne d'Arc
The Order
The Technomix
Lufia 2
&
Sonic the Hedgehog
Those are the ones i couldn't find on PSN and my list is not complete.
What are the good ones?
-----
Certinfy: I’d give this a read.
-----
Rob2K19: Kingdom Hearts 1 & 2.
-----
*Guaraná: Yeah, i meant this one but with Kingdom Hearts 3 out, what exactly is this other than you can buy 1, 2 and 3 in the same country?
-----
*Guaraná: The best PS1 games are the ones available right now.
-----
*Guaraná: You can buy them in the PSN store, right now.
-----
Cactuar: I was a Vita only user back then, but I think you can purchase a PS1 game in the Store.
-----
Sargerus: Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

*Guaraná: I was hoping you would have made mention of the ones you mentioned.
But yeah, the list is a bit small.

~!~Anyone else having PS4 issues?

WarpSpeedMolasses: seems like it's killing it, I'm almost within the realm of tech support for this thing, but I'm still not getting the updates I need (because of the fucking stupid requirements). I'm getting a "full" PS4 update every other day. 
My question is: is that stuff "just" the PS4 itself or is it like, "PS4 updates sometimes, sometimes not"? I'm running into that odd issue where I'm getting error 2562 error code 0xc00007e for some unknown reason. 
I'm gonna try googling for a fix and saw this:
So, if it's the connection issue and I can get it back, is there anything I can do besides just make sure it's not the PS4 itself, and then go figure, maybe it's the connection thing?
-----
kadotsu: Check your overwr----. If you have a checkpoint, try reconfiguring your wifi router.
-----
Lant_War: I don't think it's just the connection issue, it's something that can easily be resolved in a hard reset.
-----
Drain You: I'm not sure if that's really the issue but I can't imagine I'm supposed to have that much info. I've had this problem too and it's killing it for me.
-----
Xer0: Check your router settings.
-----
kadotsu: Your router has the 5.0 or 5.0 port set up. Check the settings and make sure the port is the 5.0 port.
-----
Drain You: I'm just trying it out on my router on the 5.0 connection. 
What do I do? 
I've had the same problem on my PS4 too.

~!~I think I finally want an RPG-Focused SP game

Masterspeed: I've been looking for something that I can get behind and actually like and play but I just know I'm not really ready for yet. I recently came across Divinity Original Sin 2 on sale and figured it could be one of those games that I'll be able to wait for and get into.
It's pretty much Divinity Original Sin 2 only wrapped up the story and setting for the next game in the series, and the first game is the longest game in the series to date. I really like it it's a point and click adventure so it's pretty much the first time I can say I really enjoy playing RPGs and I love how they've all unfolded. There's a lot to do and there's a lot to love. Even if it's REALLY short I can still get invested in it. 
But I could get it if it was a game I actually had interest in and I got to a point where I'm just not sure I want to play something I already know the story of.
So what do you guys think?
-----
Buffum: I'm in the same boat. I was actually super excited to play Divinity 2 while playing through Divinity Original Sins when it launched on PS4, and when I got to the first world it completely pulled me back in. I've got to admit I haven't really played any of the sequels to 1 and 2 that I've played, so I'm interested in trying to jump back in for 1 but not sure how to handle the narrative. I've tried the first one, and it's just too much story for me.
I plan on playing BOTH Original Sins and OS1 before trying OS2.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: I have an hour and half left and as you're already aware has a story you are familiar with and what I consider a strong foundation of the game. I'm not sure what game it's borrowing from.
-----
Masterspeed: I won't even play it for a few hours during the day. I'm so excited for OS2.
-----
Blue: I don't think any
-----
Usyren: I've played it multiple times. I can't remember a time when I didn't hate anything about it though.

TheMrPliskin: I played it originally on PS3 and never really got into it but

~!~Is a Switch Pro Dock for the Switch actually a Switch Pro Controller?

Alcibiades: The Switch is an amazing piece of hardware, one that many Nintendo games, especially in the handheld space, have struggled with throughout its lifetime. We've had games like Bayonetta, DK, Kirby Star Allies, Mario Tennis, Mario Kart, Mario Tennis Aces, and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.
But the Switch seems to be getting more and more innovative with new ways to utilize the technology. Last night I took a look at three patents that discuss a new dock for the Switch, one about a power-enhancing power-enhancing power-enhancing method, and one about a new dock for the device itself.
I'm going to quote the most interesting ones:
Now, I know Dock to Dock is a controversy, and I have no reason to believe that it is not, but I think a new dock for the Switch could solve the two-party problem.
Specifically, one of the new dock patents says that the new dock could allow the Switch to use the same kind of docking station as the dock that competitors already use to take down their Switch consoles. The patent goes on to list four potential docking options: a USB-C cable, a USB-A port, a USB-C power-converter, and a new dock.
These four options are described as “docking mechanism”, “excusely “docked” because they are the same as what you would use in portable mode, and don’t mention the USB C cables. So, I’d just use the USB C dock, and then mention “docking” because it is the same as what you would use in portable mode.”
What do you think? Do you think a new dock based on USB-C is the way to go or would it eventually be a dock that plugs into the dock that’s downsized?
-----
Renna Hazel: I don't think it's docks. I think a dock with a dedicated USB-C port would be perfect for this. There's no reason to use a USB-C in this form factor.
-----
Alcibiades: Yes, the USB C dock is named after the USB C dock for Nintendo handhelds.
-----
ZhugeEX: Oh yeah, please do not make things so incompatible

We haven't really seen the gameplay before TESO though, which will probably be great.

~!~Overkill's next game is a FPS

matimeo: New developer Abit Highrise Studios has just announced their next project:
-----
Eolz: Dead Space?
-----
Shao Kahn: That would be cool.
-----
KainXVIII: Dead Space, please...
-----
skeezx: i've always wanted to get behind this. but i guess ill just play it with wired mics instead
-----
AegonSnake: I'm gonna say that moving forward its easy for AbitHighrise to try to adapt the Dead Space formula to modern hardware. Remote play on the go is absolutely not something that I trust the developers to do well.
-----

FairyEmpire: It's a shame that this franchise is dead, but if it is being done well I wonder if they'd be willing to go back and do a Trilogy with a different formula and characters that age better than the last one. Dead Space 2 was good, but it was still underwhelming, it's been a year and a half since the last entry, I really don't know why, that's not acceptable now. Dead Space 3 wouldn't surprise me too much, but it would also not be good on PS4.
-----
Zephyriel: So is Dead Space non-canon if the last three games are in one entry? Or is it still relevant if all three games are in one entry?
-----

====================
~!~Anybody play the CRPG video games?

kvetcha: I just started playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 and I'm having a pretty good time so far. I love the atmosphere and the atmosphere feels real and believable. I'm not sure if it's the writing or the gameplay but I can't help but get a kick out of the way. I'm just curious if there are any other CRPG video games I've played that aren't Divinity: Original Sin 2 or 3? I want to know too.
-----
MouldyK: I played Witcher 3 ages ago.
I have enjoyed all the other games in that series too.
-----
RDreamer: I played the first Divinity: Original Sin.
Ive had it sitting in my steam library for years. On a wish list for one of my 5-6th consoles.
-----
kvetcha: That's actually pretty cool. I liked Witcher 1 too, but that game is not for me.
-----
makonero: I was just thinking about this game lately, it’s an amazing game.
-----
Syril: I never played anything else like it, but I'll give it a go.
-----
KNTomg: Yeah, it was my first rpg and I really liked it.
I'm more interested in the story and music but the gameplay is very repetitive and the world feels homogeneous, so I haven't played that yet.
Most rpgs have a lot of tight synopses that give you a bit of build up to a great music.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I played Witcher 1 and 2 back when I was very young (late teen or early 20s). I've never played a CRPG before but I really liked them and LOVED the setting.
-----
kvetcha: Yeah, Witcher 1 and 2 I guess. The first one, especially, is really cool, but I think the combat is a bit too slow and the combat has too many flaws for me. I think a sequel is coming soon, but I'm hoping it's more engaging and the writing is better.

~!~The history of the inscrutable Mega Man music

SolVanderlyn: Edit: I get that this is a pretty long video, but goddamn does it make a shit load of sense.
"When you first heard of all the Mega Man music in existence, you were upset because they were only Mega Man tracks."
Fairly straightforward, but somehow that got me.
It's not even that Mega Man music is inherently bad. It's that Mega Man music as a concept has just gotten a bit rubbish. Mega Man's greatest strength is that he doesn't really have to work with his instruments anymore. This leads into the next argument; Mega Man has always had a very... systematic play on the rules of Mega Man. He has to find more Mega Man-like music to play. He can choose to play the sound of the boss, or he can play the sound of the waves, or he can play the wave itself and the boss itself, and he has to work with these rules against the normal shit. 
...
That's just silly. Mega Man's musical strengths have always been about rhythm and tight soundtracks, but with Mega Man having a fixed and uniform set of rules, it just becomes a lot more fun. Mega Man has always had a fantastic ability to innovate and surprise the player, but this is also a good thing in that he does it so he doesn't have to experience the bullshit of a constant gate keeping him back in the mix.
The keyboard on the other hand, is Mega Man's raison d'etre, and it just... works so... wrong. Mega Man is a relic of a time before drums. His layout is... convoluted. Look at the first screenshot for a clip, Mega Man can't keep his index pointing upwards, he has to start his run with a perfectly straight run, then he follows a set of stairs. Look at the last screenshot for a shot of the gate, it's actually just a slope with the floor being exactly in front of it. Look at the first screenshot of this, it's coming right up towards the back of the screen. Look at the last screenshot of this, it's actually facing the wall. Mega Man just doesn't care. 
This is not a rant thread, this is a post in which you can take Mega Man and his music and analyses and counter arguments for and against the new Mega Man games.

~!~Nintendo Switch is now the best selling console in Japan (as per From Software survey)

ggx2ac: There are some really good news for Nintendo fans, but I thought it important to highlight one of the biggest surprise for the game ranking.
The game ranking in the latest Nintendo Direct is:
Spoiler
But let's break down the story a bit more to calculate the sales/install base for each game.
From Software survey
The survey is available at the following link: 
Spoiler: The survey results
From Software has managed to get to the top 5 spots :
1. God of War
2. Monster Hunter World
3. Monster Hunter Fes
4. Smash Bros Ultimate
5. Splatoon 2
6. FIFA 19
7. Minecraft
8. Mario Kart 8
9. Minecraft: Playstation 4
10. Mario Tennis: Top 10
I still can't figure out how to fact the game is now the best selling in the world. But even so, it charted in the top 5 and it's amazing to see that Nintendo keeps doing what it's doing.
-----
KoolAid: No Splatoon 2

Flux: I'm excited for the new Assassin's Creed and Red Dead coming out this year, both are well known for their trailers, and both have some of the best openings I've seen in a game for the years, so I'm looking forward to those too.
Any other similar trailers?
EDIT: Just to be clear, trailers are not related to announcements or releases. We cannot guarantee these things are in the near future. However, I do think there are still trailers worth watching out there and I would try to watch them if you have any interest.
-----
Piscus: I saw Spider-Man at E3 and thought it was a good video game.
-----
Flux: That's what I was thinking too.
-----
Cybersai: Watch the entire opening theme for God of War, it's probably one of the best openings in a video game ever.
-----
Flux: I actually can't remember the last time I even saw the opening.
-----
DrakenAstro: Watch the opening of FF7r right now
-----
jacks81x: Watch the opening of the new Jackbox game right now, it's good.
-----
Aters: Watch the opening of this.

====================
~!~MS is making my wi-fi redundant (so no bluetooth!)

jett: I've had my home router connect to my TV for a long time now. It's always been the same - my internet sucks and I'm getting new internet traffic. The TV (not my router) is a 3.5" laptop computer, meaning my power and ethernet connection is fine.
My internet connection is slower than when I started yesterday - maybe I've been off wifi for a bit? But the speed is absolute horrible. I've connected the router to a UPS and to the router proper - but the UPS stops receiving a lot of HTTP using another connection. So I need to get something running in the background.
It's the 5GHz router. I've never seen it connect before. Does Microsoft support this feature before? I'm going to have to hack my router somehow, so I have to pay for this.
I'm not sure what other devices support this, but I know my TV doesn't support this.
I've tried different devices - my router, laptop but it's a mobile PC. One I've never connected to and the one I'm connected to works with no issues. One I've never used and one that I used on a Costco demo.
I'm not sure - is anyone else's router with this? I've wanted something locally for a few months and it worked fine yesterday.
I can get a service call with an ISP about this from a friend. They said that my modem is the cause of interference and should be brought to a neutral location.
What else are you getting today, Microsoft?
-----
Dio: check your internet browser's "Connection test"
if it is your modem, disable your internet browser.
-----
jett: I have no idea what I'm talking about. I thought it was my home network but it doesn't look like that's the case.
-----
Braaier: I'm genuinely surprised by the fast speeds you're getting with that router. I've only ever had an Ethernet adapter, and that was my router. I don't know what's going on. I have an ATV and I've never had any problems with speeds, even on Ethernet.
-----
kadotsu: If you're using a UPS, honestly consider a Home Theater or something like that. It limits your ISP's ability to send data to your modem.
-----
====================
~!~I was hyped for The Division, but it's not playing my favorite formula. Recommend me some short and sweet serviceers!

Theorry: Title says it all.
I see many people here have played Division and have suggestions for some nice changes. I just wanted to know what your overall opinion of the game is now.
-----
Kade: Siege is my go-to. I love the weapon diversity, the PvE experience and so much customization.
-----
Mojito: Try out Destiny 2. It's the best in the series imo.
-----
LossAversion: The Division is a big part of why I like The Division. It's one of the best.
-----
Theorry: I mean I think it is. The Division is a huge part of why I played Destiny 1. But you can do with a small group of people and you wouldn't really need all that much.
Vegas are a big part of it though.
-----
LossAversion: Yeah I think for me, that's part of why I love Destiny so much. I can just go watch a bit of the Anthem demo on YouTube and see how they've done with the PvP.
-----
DarthWalden: I've been playing Division 2 and Destiny 1 off and on since launch and I think it's the best and most satisfying shooter I've played this generation.
-----
Theorry: I think it is. But you can probably just play Siege if you like the PvE experience.
-----
Ametroid: Destiny is pretty great but not as good as Division
-----
Theorry: I mean I did play Division 1 offcourse. But its got a lot more content in it.
I did play Division 2 offcourse also. But its got more stuff in it.
-----

====================
~!~Pokémon Switch: How is it?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I'm going to go out on a limb and say Pokémon is far more accessible than Pokémon Sun or Ultra Sun. I've never played the original or X/Y.
The new games are all I can get out of this gen. The new Pokemon have a lot of new mechanics that I thought was a little bit more complex back in the days. I don't think the newer games feel as polished as the originals. The game looks amazing. Some of the animations are just plain out of place. I feel like I'm watching a movie in one of those systems.
So is there a universal consensus as to how to play this game or are there specific systems I should use to play it better?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I dunno about nostalgia but I played a ton of those on sale back in the day
As for the general consensus I definitely like the game and the most accessible, most accessible and most complex to get them
-----
Ryuelli: I played a ton of the original games on my Game Boy Color. 
I don't think the games are as polished as the old ones though. I definitely think the newer games are a little more complex and there's a lot more to do.
-----
RochHoch: This.
The games are definitely better in terms of mechanics, but there's nothing particularly "improved" from the original games.
-----
Jahranimo: I played a lot of the original Pokemon games on my Game Boy Color when I was a kid.
I'm not sure about nostalgia, but those were some fantastic games.
-----
Zalman: The newest games are still fun, but I don't think they hold up as well as the original games. They look a little bit worse and the game is just so much more blurry.
-----
Chauzu: I wish the game had a bit more depth to it but I think pokemon is one of the few series with a solid franchise.
-----
Ravelle: I played the first 10 Pokemon games on PS2 but I remember having a tough time with it, I quit then kinda forgot about it...
-----
yuoke: It's still one of the best pokemon games.
-----
yumms: The original games are still fun to play. I didn't
====================
~!~I'm terminally ill and wanted to play the Yakuza games. Which should i play?

dawgparty: I live in a tiny apartment. My doctor recommendedy Yakuza 6 yesterday but unfortunately I'm not up for playing it yet. I would like to play something other than Yakuza so I was wondering which way the vote was going to be going.
-----
Novel Mike: Yakuza 6 is pretty much a new game and you should definately play Yakuza 3 if you just wanted to get in on the action.
-----
Dizastah: Play Yakuza 0.
-----
TheGreenArrow: 0 is the first one and you are in for a treat with the best ending in the series.
-----
Dark_Castle: Yakuza 0
-----
dawgparty: Thanks for the tips! I've been itching to just get back into Yakuza. I've played all the games except for Yakuza 6 and haven't been able to get into the others. I just started Yakuza 5 and will probably do that as well but I'm interested in the story.
-----
Rika: I have to say that Yakuza 0 is the best game I've played in the last few years. It has a great story and characters, a nice story mode, a decent difficulty, a very well developed story that helps you understand the characters, etc. 
It's a good way to start and is easy to get into the series.
-----
Khalme: Yakuza 0 and Kiwami can't come soon enough.
-----
dawgparty: I was under the impression that if you're interested in the Yakuza games, then localisation is going to be a problem. Not necessarily it being a problem in fact, but still it's a good step for people who don't have time to sink into the series but want to play a reasonably well known and interesting game.

"Do we have to start from 0 and work our asses off for five more years?"
"No."

ChatonPute: The title is just as accurate to the classic NieR

-----
J75: Venom was a poor man's Spider-Man
-----
WrenchNinja: Venom was originally a decent villain, he got lucky and ended up saving the world.

Cordy: I mean, the good villain is the bad guy. Spidey found his own side of his character too, the bad guy was just about to get his son killed.

~!~The SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive Sonic 2 game selection

oni-link: I think this is the second reason I wanted to make a thread
I have worked with a lot of developers, both in and outside of Japan, and I noticed that many of them had a lot of interesting (or even bad) games on their cabinet, not just Mega Drive titles. This got me thinking about the various Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games available on their online store
So what games are you fondest of?
I'm looking for some recommendations for my SNES/Mega Drive Era friends
Some good choices
-----
Zippo: Mega Drive is my favorite, but I wouldn't call it a "classic".
It's a fuck awful lot of fun.
-----
steveon_: Mega Drive 1 & 2 are among my favorite games, so I would go for that.
The first one is a pretty easy game to teach a friend to download.
-----
oni-link: I'd also say you can get a lot of those awesome light gun games on Genesis/MD
-----
themuzzotheory: If you're looking for simpler games that can be played in short bursts (like shooters), you can't go wrong with Mega Drive/Genesis titles.
-----
oni-link: I'm aware of these, but I just remember them being a lot of fun
The selection is pretty insane
-----
bmdubya: I’d say so. Only issue I had with the Genesis was some of the games were incomplete. Still a great selection, and I highly recommend you a good library for the time.
-----
Symphony: I have to echo the “Mega Drive is the best platform for classic gaming!” thread. It’s the reason why I play all my Mega Drive games on. I love their games and can’t imagine spending hours messing about with them.
-----
oni-link: It’s a weird question, but I guess it’s common for people with a young family or friends to have a Mega Drive and have the game they wanted to play be available on it
I also mentioned that the emulation on the Mega Drive is pretty great, although a bit expensive
-----
Krejlooc: There's a lot to be lamented about on that list. The Genesis has some of the best hardware out there, but

~!~[Gameindustry.biz] The underappreciated role of global sales in generating global spending

Arthands: From gameindustry.biz
I find this article (article) a fascinating study that focuses on a subgenre of gamers, the subgenre. The article focusses on the role of global sales in generating global spending, and the consequences Global Games Cup has on gaming industry. I will leave this article for others to pick up :
The rise of esports (and the decline of games as a medium in general) 
How game tournaments and events boost the skill gap and engagement 
The impact of esports on music 
The impact of esports on the gaming community 
How esports are evolving from video games to high tech business 
How esports are evolving from a small venue (to global) 
The impact of esports on music and gaming 
Of course I have already covered all of those at the start, but I wanted to bring up one that has quite a bit of merit, and in my opinion has the greatest potential.
This article discusses with an interesting degree of statistical significance the estimated fraction of players who play video games each year, and also the impact of esports on game development revenue 
Further, the article considers the role of race in videogames and describes how different types of gamers are linked with different types of stakeholders.
-----
alr1ght: That is the most important point: race != graphics.
-----
sir_crocodile: More data, and more data from large chunks of people = bad.
-----
Tofer: How the hell does a race game have so much more players than a racing game?
-----
Greatest Ever: .
-----
Cess007: Greatly, thanks for sharing. Seems like the article is only going to be relevant for esports, not for the games themselves, and not for me.
-----
Raijinto: Interesting study, thanks for sharing it.
-----
Theorry: .
-----
MouldyK: Does this counts as esports or is it just marketing jargon?
-----
takriel: I thought the writer said "race isn't a race".
-----
FluxWaveZ: It's about the impact of different markets, types of content, and social movements on the industry. Also, the writer was specifically talking about how "the Olympic Games" in particular

~!~A look at the Nintendo Switch’s First-Party Lineups

Equanimity: Nintendo of America produces the only lineups of first-party games that really matter to me. It covers the entire Switch First Party lineup, and covers every single Nintendo franchise, indie, third-party, and platform game. It also covers the first week of March as well.
Here's a couple of my favorite games by Mode:
And a couple by Nintendo Essentials:
-----
Phokal: I always like seeing some of these.
-----
Datajoy: I always want to check out the Smash Bros ones.
-----
Phoko: I don't really have any examples, but I remember having a blast with Mario Kart 8 when I was younger, nice.
-----
Phoko: That's a really cool list, I forgot that was the case.
-----
Phoko: I love the ones on the list, especially for those who haven't played them yet.
-----
Phoko: It's not the Smash ones, but I think that's just a surprise for the current lineup.
-----
Mediking: I was really into Kirby's Epic Yarn and the second one, but I was a kid I remember 3D dot game heroes. That one is one of the best.
-----
Phoko: It's the second Smash game on the list and one of the best games in the genre, so it's definitely a surprise to me. I definitely had fun with that one.
-----
Zen Hero: Happy to see a list where I can actually enjoy it. I think I love a lot of the Nintendo games featured in this blog.

~!~Is there a way to get the 3DS emulator working on Switch without losing signal?

mogster7777: i just got a new 3DS so im only able to play eshop games 
I have a HDMI connected to the hdmi port on the dock and the emulator is working but im still having multikuy disconnecting issues. Its seems like its failing like everytime I attempt to play anything in general i get an error message. Is there a way to get the emulator to connect properly without losing signal?
I have a dual screen setup and the first one has the home button so i have an HDMI connected to both the hdmi port and the second has the tv button so i have to be able to navigate the eshop easily. Is there a way to get the emulator to work?
I did the same for the first system. I keep encountering long load screens and long loading pauses while playing because its happens infrequently and it is annoying to be used for so long. It doesn’t work for me in this regard because I had to leave the system in the dark for a minute or so and I could only see a few things. I had to reach into the settings and deactivate the 3DS from the system settings menu. Is there a solution to this?
I don’t want to be playing character sneem games that I have to stare at for 50 minutes at a time while I stare at the 3DS. Is there a way to get the emulator to connect to the switch without losing signal or doing it through an HDMI cable somehow?
No way I can find the right cables to connect the switch to the 3DS yet because of my current situation I am stuck with cable that doesn’t work at all. This is kinda heartbreaking.
-----
Kokonoe: Yeah, I have a 3DS with just one cable connected to the dock.
-----
Dreamboum: I have a second 3DS that can emulate pretty much anything. It's really rare though.
-----
mogster7777: I had a good time with the Switch since day 1, I highly recommend them. I had to get a switch capture card just to have it work. I have a hdmi cable plugged into the ceiling in the front room but all the other connections are just to plug in a switch. I only have one cable plugged into the dock but all other

BadWolf: Hey everyone.
It doesn't get better.
-----
Cartridge Games: Would rather play a different version of Smash if it’s on Switch.

ASaiyan: It isn't dead. It's just not good enough anymore.
-----

jariw: I have the same feeling. I haven't played Melee in years. I know it's already been ported to other platforms.
-----
Jahranimo: I feel like I've been out of the Nintendo loop for so long. 
I'm still the biggest Nintendo fan here.
-----
Atheerios: If it's not on Switch it's dead already
-----
Dardan Sandiego: It's dead. People don't even like Smash anymore and if something was to die it would probably get ported to other platforms.
-----
Neptonic: It's dead already
-----
Astral: It’s not dead. It’s a better version of Smash too.

~!~Final Fantasy XV is the best Final Fantasy since 9

Phantom Thief: Seriously.
There are only so many Final Fantasy games, and it’s not even close to the grand scale of the first two years of the mainline series, let alone the previous two entries.
The combat of Final Fantasy XV is... so good.
And it’s not even close.
(And I don’t even have a comparison chart, sorry.)
-----
Transistor: It's the best JRPG of the gen.
-----
The Last One: It's the best JRPG of the year
-----
Abdul Malik Ka'bah: I don't think any game is better than this game tbh
-----
The Last One: But which is better than the rest of the games in the series.
-----
KZXcellent: Too few JRPGs disappoint. It's the 1st best FF to come out in years.
-----
BRSxIgnition: It's the 2nd best FF of the year easily.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think this is kinda of a stretch, but I think FF15 is probably a better benchmark than the rest.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think this is fair

~!~Wii U Games

ASaiyan: Hey everyone! I just found out that there are a lot of Wii U games coming to the Switch. I had previously thought there would be a lot of them due to Wii U games being released every few months, but I'm pretty happy now! I already have about 20 Wii U games installed and am currently finishing up Smash. I have a bunch of balance patches to download as well. As stated before, about 20 of those are multiplayer games. Some of them are online and don't allow local wireless, so I had to check to see if that changed or not. Other ones are single player games so I guess I'll know about them tonight!
First party titles I'm interested in:
Thimbleweed Park
Owlboy
The Last Door
Bayonetta 2
Joggernauts
Pluto
Golf Story
Valkyria Chronicles
SMITE
Stardew
RIME
Virtual On
Shikhirajen
Super Bomberman R
-----
Sir Guts: First of all I’d recommend you a Wii U Virtual On, you can play offline now (ie no online), it’s the best one since the 360 version.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Wooooty
-----
ASaiyan: Oh so, just bought Wii U games yesterday! :D
-----
Indelible: Bought a lot of Switch games. Just got Yooka Laylee today!
-----

Cartridge Games: Thimbleweed Park is a GB+ so it’s worth playing that.
Fire Emblem Warriors is a GB original, it’s also a great single player game
-----
WonderLuigi: I would recommend Kirby Star Allies. Amazing game.
-----
tulpa: I think you can play it offline, but it's not like Wii U games. The game is great.
-----
ASaiyan: I like the game, and it's a blast. You should probably check it out too. I suspect it's on sale a lot to short due to the high price tag.

~!~What is your favourite ‘Lemon Crest’ fast-paced zone bosses?

SantaC: Mine is the queen of boss rush. She is relentless until you are down to 1HP.
-----
Dojima: Lumino Hill in Xenoblade 2. That fight is just fire all day
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: I would have to say Xeno 2 with the Torna expansion. I love the music, the boss fights, the sense of discovery, and the sheer challenge. 
Not to mention the amazing music.
-----
Strings: The queen of slow zone is a very good choice, though, since I've heard the same praise for the dashing boss in the earlier Xenoblade games.
-----
Grexeno: I like the slow-mo that Xeno is not my favourite.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: You can only choose 3, and I think from my limited experience with the game, that I would go with 3 to stick to one system.
-----
Cisce: I love this post.
-----
Kangi: The best zone.
-----
EvilChameleon: This.

Encephalon: Recently I decided to take a look at the potential of a Gamepad. I've seen a few opinions floating around online, but my first read seemed to suggest that it might be a way for people who don't play a lot of retro games to have a way to access the old console for older games, but I found this to be a comprehensive read that I still don't have access to.
As someone who has both a Gamepad and a Gamepad, how do you feel about it? It's not something I'm sure of at present, but I'm curious as to what Era thinks about it.
I've seen many titles mentioned, but I'm willing to wager if there's any that you've missed.
-----
Master Chuuster: I don't really think it's a thing, but I think it's a neat idea.
The biggest problem I have with it is that it can be hard to just find a way to play old games.
-----
Phantom Thief: It's not a thing I can say I do. I have a 3DS and Switch, while I use my Gamepad to play current games, and it has been a hassle to just find a way to play something.
-----
Encephalon: I don't really understand what I have to do. I've seen suggestions like this from people who own multiple consoles, even multiple Gamepads. I just have to be able to find a way to simply connect my Gamepad to the TV and continue playing the old games.
-----
Master Chuuster: I'm going to need a new Gamepad and a new Switch to keep up.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, it's a pretty neat idea, and it is one of the reasons I own an Xbox One. I can still hook up a Retron 5.1 sound bar to the TV, which doesn't have a PDP, and still need the gamepad for playing Steam games.
-----
Encephalon: How does that work? Does it connect the TV and the gamepad and controllers?
-----
Master Chuuster: I'll hook my Xbox game pad with the TV input from the PS4 controller input.
-----
Phantom Thief: The PS4 controller has a similar setup. You connect the Gamepad and Controller to the

~!~STEAM: Durante and his team are looking to release a new client for Steam

Volimar: The post that got me thinking about this client is currently making its way to Windows 10. For those that aren't familiar, the original Steam client, originally designed for Mac OS before it was ported to Windows 10, was eventually removed, replaced by a full blown Steam client made up of all the Valve games, and eventually abandoned.
Now, I was just looking for some of their games, and I was wondering what their client is looking like. They've published a pretty significant patch notes for the new Steam client, and I wanted to give them your thoughts on it.
They've published a pretty extensive patch notes, but I'd be interested in any ideas on their preferred control scheme, if they'll be feasible in the future.
Steam notes:
- They've added a new client that works really well with existing games.
- Added support for games that support multiple launchers.
- Added new game per Steam curator tab.
- Added support for titles released on Steam.
- Added support for cloud saves.
- Added support for queue times.
- Added support for per-account cloud saves.
- Added support for per-client save transfer.
- Added support for per-party account cloud saves.
They've also updated their cloud saves to work well with multiple platforms.
-----
Saucycarpdog: Pretty cool stuff. Glad to see they're still supporting the Steam client.
-----
FairyEmpire: I mean, it's not that complicated... But it's what I actually expected. I've been avoiding all the Fortnite stuff, but they need to take a lot notes from their past.
-----
Deleted member 11093: This is pretty big as well, really nice.
-----

Volimar: No per-game save transfer? :(
... What about the ones you can play offline?
-----
TheUnseenTheUnheard: They should fix the disappearing chat window.
-----
FairyEmpire: I tried the Steam client at most a couple times, and never even got a single message from them. They've always just been an incredibly annoying and slow company. Never has a client been as good as Steam, they've never been able to satisfy a market that they once knew could do something even remotely interesting. What's worse is that they haven

~!~In DMCV's cutscenes, do you think Nero should have a different approach to combat?

SolVanderlyn: DMCV has one of the most open worlds I've ever witnessed, and I honestly feel like it's better than the first time we're playing the game.
The game is a lot more aggressive, with you having control of the fight, and it's actually fun.
I feel like the fight is the biggest thing, but you have two ways of dodging, one way is Nero's way, where you can shoot or parry at the enemies, or you can use a Devil Trigger.
Like Nero's is literally a Devil Trigger, but because it has the energy of a Devil, you can parry their attacks without their Devil Trigger. That's how I feel.
But because the energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the Energy of the
So, in DMC V, you control Dante and you shoot Nero by holding his shoulder button and moving it a little bit. But most of the time, Dante is also holding the button and firing off a little bit. In fact, Dante is the first time we're seeing the face of Dante, but Link is the other character.
Nero is a bigger deal because he's a lesser protagonist, and it's surprising, because DMC V makes the first appearance of him as a straight up demon hunter. He's much more of a supporting cast member, and Link is another character who has more of an arc.
DMC V makes the first appearance of the first Devil Breakers, which are the ones that were used in the first two Devil Saga games.
I feel like Devil May Cry 5 will have the most Devil Breakers, but I feel like if DMC V has the same approach, I feel like the first three will have the least amount of them, because even with Devil Breakers in, it's clear Nero is still a bigger deal than he was in DMC 4.
What do you think?
-----
ASaiyan: I think the answer is obvious.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: I don't think Nero

I wonder how much better the Switch version is than the PS4 version?

~!~Nintendo Switch: new Firmware update is out, unofficial firmware update is now ~50% faster

Phantom Thief: Potential leak coming in about 30 minutes
-----
Kouriozan: I guess they must be testing the waters to make sure the system doesn’t get too stable after its 5 days.
-----
TheMoon: This is�/= likely a placeholder, but a placeholder is a placeholder.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, we’re finally getting OSD for the Switch.
-----
ILikeFeet: a placeholder for stability sake, so they're gonna replace it with something else. even with the free space they had, they haven't made any big changes to the system besides the OSD
-----
Nuclear Muffin: I guess stability is a big goal for Nintendo at the moment. They haven't made any major changes in the OS so far, so I don't think it's that big of a jump...
-----
ned_ballad: Perfect time to show bowser
-----
Mory Dunz: it's really a placeholder
they had a good sense of direction for the game and would like to keep feedback to be exchanged
-----
mazi: i mean, i'm sure it was a placeholder for around a year, this is a safe bet to assume it doesn't change.
-----
ned_ballad: this is the case for a lot of Nintendo games, like mario kart 8, splatoon, and some of their other smaller games

~!~So, what’s the best way to play retro games on modern PCs?

ElectricBlanketFire: I was just thinking about the PC retro community today. I grew up on NES and SNES and I’ve never played a PC retro game. I hate emulators and the age of the internet.
But I guess what I’m asking is what’s the best way to play retro games on modern PCs? I’ve never played a retro game on a modern console or handheld.
-----
mazi: check out the classicone subreddit.
the emulator scene is alive
-----
denpanosekai: Retroarch?
-----
Powerofthecloud: Emulation.
-----
D65: Virtual PC
-----
Certinfy: I mean it’s not that hard to install. It’s pretty cheap even and is basically a bootleg.
I’d still recommend the RX 480
-----
Tregard: My personal experience:
Good question, I've been looking into this forum as well and finding that there are very few retro games on modern platforms.
-----
Windu: this is a fantastic question.
i'm currently working on myelfowardhomebrew and I'll find some old games that I can play on my own hardware (so i can play on emulator)
-----
Cantona222: Ah yes, the answer is Retroarch.
I'm not a real PC gamer but if you want to play retro games on a modern PC and run emulators or emulate source code (anything retro you can on your system!) then just give me a modern console.
-----
Cantona222: I want to go back to playing old games thanks to the Switch.

~!~What are the best long-form Nintendo DS games?

TheIdiot: I've been itching to play DS games for awhile, and DS games mostly just hold up fine, especially for DS games. I don't think there's been any bad quality games released for the DS, but I think I'm going to end up playing my DS when I'm done with Smash, so I think I'd like to dive into that. So, what are the best short-form Nintendo DS games?
-----
Zippro: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a pretty good Metroidvania, but it's only 1 hour long.
-----
Jahranimo: Final Fantasy VI is the only good one that I can think of.
-----
HiroTSK: Earthbound
-----
Mr-Joker: Luigi's Mansion for the N64.
-----
DNAbro: Earthbound
-----
TheIdiot: I'm going to go with Final Fantasy VI.
-----
Opa-Pa: Both The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy VI are both good games.

TheMoon:

~!~What are the worst games of 2018?

Bman94: 2018 has the worst games I remember. So let's take a look at the ones that are actually good.
1. Resident Evil 7
I remember this game being pretty bad and it's one of the best Survival Horror games and the only Resident Evil game I've played. I even remember the enemy placement and the forced tank controls. It was also really hard and really frustrating to play.
2. Vanquish
Ok, this is a PS4 exclusive. It's not a bad game by any means but it's not the worst Resident Evil game. I know this is PC only and it's not coming to consoles. I know this game is PC only. I think this is the first PS4 exclusive. That's not bad.
3. God of War
Everybody loved this game and everyone was like "this is the best uncharted game period". Sony Santa Monica is like the best non-mobile studio because of this game. It's like a Sony product. The game is actually very difficult because you have to wall off the main character by taking two of his attacks and by using grenades. The game is actually really hard. The game was released very late in the last generation.
4. Far Cry 5
Far Cry 5 is one of the few games that I didn't finish and I just wanted to finish it. I finally did that and it was a boring game. But I finished it last week and I really liked it. The setting and the story were really interesting and the gameplay was fun. But the most annoying thing was the enemies. One of the main antagonists was really bad. But the main villain was really great. Who is the main villain? I like him because he's a dad and he really wants his daughter to come back and help him in his fight against the evil brother. But I really hate the enemies. And some of them are just really annoying like the pistols.
5. Red Dead Redemption 2
I actually played this game so many times that I memorized the map and drove around and did all the side activities I wanted to do. But I just couldn't do it again.
6. God of War
I am not a huge fan of this game personally. I love the story and the world but I just couldn't get into it. I have the most fun playing a game than playing one.
7. Just Cause 2

====================
~!~The next God of War will be the first in which you play as a dwarf

Gravity Insanity: More information on the game has been released.
-----
Daffy Duck: Huh
-----
Mercenary09: Why did they not just put him in the game like in the movie?
-----
Viceratops: You should totally say “Kratos in the movie” since they did the same thing with him in the game.
-----
Kenzodielocke: I don‘t think you can have an dwarf in a game, but they’d have to do it twice.
-----
Kolx: Inb4 "You can have a dwarf in a game if they make a movie about a dwarf playing a character I guess."
-----
Astral: Think I have this movie set for the new year.
-----
AegonSnake: It's a movie.
-----
kadotsu: Why is Ratchet and Clank in a game tho?
-----
Ghost: Will the movie be in the same vein as the movie?

====================
~!~Games you would lose sleep over if they released on anything but their own platform

The era of Luigi: First I´m talking about the PS4, I would have lost ANY sleep over a port to my switch, because I want AC:O on my switch.
It´s not even that the game is difficult, it´s just that the PS4 version is much better in all the ways it could have been, the game is so much fun, and it´s a great game. But when it comes to AC:O, the game is so polished and perfect that I´ve lost sleep over it.
-----
Platy: I just can't get enough of these old games
-----
Nuclear Muffin: I really love how the PS4 version is so polished and pristine, in my opinion. It’s actually kind of like a dream game for me, the PS1 era of Mega Man games being my favourite.
-----
lunarwhale: I'd never say no to the Switch version, but I'll get it if they added a PC version for PS4/Switch.
-----
Kadin: I'd have no sleep over a port to the PS4. But I'm not sure if I would "want it to run" on Switch.
-----
The era of Luigi: I agree, but I think it would be just about localization and QoL improvements, I mean on the Switch it's still missing a lot of things but I'd still like to get it.
-----
Glio: I'm not sure if I would care about a port, because I already have both PS4 and Switch.
-----
MuddyDonut: I do not want it to run badly on switch. I have multiple PS4 and Switch consoles.
-----
The era of Luigi: yeah, I agree, I just want a port of the PS3 and PS4 games, with PS1-3-4-Vega being my old games.
-----
Crayon: I don't want to play it in its current state.

~!~Flying Medusa in Super Mario Odyssey

Krejlooc: Well, duh.
-----
RochHoch: That's not Medusa, that's King Ham.
-----
Krejlooc: Well, duh.
-----
carlosrox: He looks much younger then.
-----
Krejlooc: he's not
-----
Krejlooc: but he's much MUCH closer to Wario
-----
Mitch: I think it's more of a King Luigi reference, Wario looks like Luigi the most.
-----
Krejlooc: he's Luigi the most, Wario is the most popular.
-----
Derachi: I thought Wario was actually referencing King K. Rool?

~!~What's the best way to play the Naruto IP?

Hate: I'm looking to play the following Naruto games.
Naruto Storm
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 1
Naruto Storm 2
Naruto Storm 3
Naruto Storm: Full Burst
Naruto Storm: Ultimate Ninja Storm
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
I'm not sure what else is out there. Is there a general consensus? What do you guys recommend?
-----
Mugy: The Naruto Ultimate Ninja Season 1 cart is on sale from Bandai.
The Kaguya Shippūden is the best way imo.
-----
Redcrayon: I think the most straightforward of the series, Stormy, is the one that pops into my head.
-----
Kaguya: I think 3 is the straight best way. 1 and 2 are the easiest, though 3 is the hardest imo.
-----
Mediking: Ninja storm 1 is so good. And most of the series.
-----
Katy Perry: The worst one is probably the Naruto manga. That's easily Naruto.
-----
Redcrayon: I had a buddy who went on to make a trilogy of these for his PS2 collection. But I don't think he ever played the original Naruto games.
-----
Lant_War: It's not a series since the N64 era, but I'd play them all. Storm, the GOAT Naruto.
-----
Hate: Stormy.
There a lot of Naruto spin offs on the west too.
-----
Poutine Runner 2049: Stormy
Stormy Breakout
Stormy Ultimate Storm
