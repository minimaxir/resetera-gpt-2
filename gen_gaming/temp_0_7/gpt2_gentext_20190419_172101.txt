~!~Dragon Quest X has localization issues

Disgraced: I have a question about DQX and it's story. Do you normally play the Japanese versions and then skip the localization? I know that most don't. I found this in a comment in another thread:
I don't mean to be a "banana only gamer" or something, but it is a pretty clear topic.
The Japanese scripts of Dragon Quest are generally terrible. There's this weird trend in most of the South Asian scripts where the text is bad for the plot and the text is even worse for characters involved. It's not an enormous difference, but the South American scripts are much more streamlined.
How does this happen? Again, I'm not trying to be a "banana only gamer" or anything, but...
-----
WonderLuigi: you're not a "banana only gamer"... i'm talking about the people who played the game and then didn't skip it. you know, the people who played the game and then didn't play it again
-----
Disgraced: Yeah I don't think so, it's more of a cultural thing.
-----
Azajabar: No, I am not a gamer, I like playing the games and being entertained, but I dont like it when other people don't get to play my games, it's like the racism issue is in a game and not something related to the story at all
-----
Cartridge Games: I guess playing games in the South American version is technically more accepted.
Not sure if it’s a problem or not though.
South America is much more open, oddly enough
-----
mazi: you mean the people who play the games
-----
nadbmal: I think that the South American scripts are actually worse in the Japanese versions
-----
Kromeo: I don't think it's a big difference honestly, but I do think that it's a culture thing and often people skip the script in the South American versions of DQ.
It's a culture thing and often people skip the script in the South American versions of DQ because of the need to be banned

Disgraced: Yeah for the fuck of 'cough' don't you remember that it's a culture thing? I've been a fan of DQ since the first game and I played DQ2 but the story of DQ8 and

~!~I just got a new 3DS after seeing an ad for a Smash (likely E3 related) tournament

Telpis: I’ve been thinking about getting a 3DS lately and noped out of the hobby completely. I’ve had a Gamecube all my life and with tournaments coming up in 2019 it’s time to try my hand at something new.
The last Nintendo system I truly played was the Gamecube. I haven’t really touched it since then. It’s time to get one again for Smash.
What kind of games are you into?

Waluigilicious: Pokemon Quest.

~!~With Nintendo Online coming to a close, what are your plans for the future of Nintendo Online?

Phantom Thief: Nintendo’s ever-growing ever-growing ever-growing ever-growing Online program looks like a mess. Between the constant needlessly (and increasingly costly) bloat in the Online Service (now called Ninty), the lack of innovation (and even hope for a new entry), the uncertain viability of the existing online architecture (especially the infrastructure), the unwillingness of the Switch Online User Interface (no official mention of it), and the fact that, as of late, the online system doesn’t seem to offer the kind of user-friendly alternative to the eShop that NES games offered, the hybrid user interface seems like the most barebones, antiquated, and possibly unenjoyable take on a Nintendo online system.
That may sound bad, but I think it’s a fair criticism. Nintendo’s offering of a barebone, modern interface to a fan of NES titles is still relatively simple. NES games offered a slick, responsive, snappy UI, and Nintendo’s been faithful to the SNES on a frequentlylovable approach (NES Online still works flawlessly though). I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Nintendo’s offering of a clean, modern UI in addition to the traditional SNES UI. 
I’m not saying the NES UI should be antiquated. But I think it’s fair to say the NES UI is an undercooked, lightweight, and unnecessary effort for the online play experience. 
So what do you guys think? Do you agree that Nintendo’s offering of modern, modern UI is a poor, clunky, and unnecessary effort for the online play experience? Or do you prefer a clean, modern UI, and I think Nintendo should just offer a modern, modern UI for the online play experience? 
I think Nintendo needs to reconsider what the online play feature of the Switch is supposed to be. I’m not asking for a barebone, current UI, one that won’t get boring. I’m asking for a clean, current UI.

I dont know what I need to do to even sound this. I just want to turn it off

~!~What is the best DLC in gaming?

FreeMufasa: I’m currently playing RDR 2 DLC for the first time and it’s been a blast.
I’m enjoying the base game but the expansion DLC is just miles better, and I’m getting the sense of humor and wit therein, though I’ve never in my life seen a game this good.
I also have a PS4 Pro so it doesn’t look like it’ll be a problem, but I guess I’m not seeing it.
I’m also running a lot of Battlefront 2 on that day (May 22) and I haven’t really touched the DLC yet because my gosh is the base game overloading.
I know DLCs are usually seen as a drawback of almost any games but man does the base game look nice and I think I’m going to love the ones that come out of the gate and are fun too.
-----
Jawmuncher: Legion Valor and War of the New Phases are where you want to be.
-----
sambills: War of the New Phases is where you want to be and its super great
-----
FreeMufasa: Yes I know Valor is the best and I enjoyed that one as well.
-----
Truant: I've played a lot of WoW Legion (and vanilla) with friends over the years. It's pretty fun and engaging.
-----
Ryuhza: I don't see War of the New Phases taking it away from most. It's just a more straight forward WoW take, which is good.
-----
FreeMufasa: Absolutely. I’ve never actually played a new zone, just level up faster, catch up on the lore etc. It’s always fun. I just wish there were a lot more DLC characters which would be quite fun to play as.
-----
Elandyll: I love the Alliance of the New Phases
(I'm far from fully sold the game now, but I've been wanting to play it for awhile...)
I'm playing it for the 5th time and it does look good, but nothing special.
I also recommend WoW Classic + as a sort of expansion for WoW 3.

~!~Is it time for Microsoft to allow arcade racing games on Steam?

Maneil99: Wth
Back when racing games were a thing, it was really rare to see a studio trying to develop a racing game. Sega, Namco, Capcom, etc. I felt like Microsoft was trying to do the arcade racing dream in the wrong direction imo. I would have preferred something like Burnout or Forza or Forza Horizon but I guess I wish I could get all of those.
I remember a few bmks trying to do arcade racing on steam but they felt kind of too limited. Now I think Forza is the best arcade racer and I think Valve is the best developer.
-----
minimaxir: They need to get a german studio to port Forza Horizon 1 and 2.

~!~[Rumor] Nintendo Officially Places Price Poll on Television

LordKano: So now that there's been some time since the last one has passed, Nintendo is finally putting the pressure into to TV fans, and with that pressure comes a firm policy for what games you can buy with the Nintendo Online subscription. The price for the service is now 90% of the cost of Nintendo Online, plus the current price per month is 18.79 and I think it's worth mentioning that the official Nintendo Television Network will be in the same price range as the Nintendo Network TV, at least according to this rumor.
The reason is because this is the first official tweet from Nintendo of these changes, and it's also the first official announcement that this will be an official price option for the tv.
This is the first time that Nintendo has ever formally announced changes to this. In January and February, they did exactly this, and now it's official for tv apps to enable a 5-year Netflix plan. Through this, Nintendo is already single-handedly bringing the paid Netflix service to all of its paid subscribers.
If you want to read the full story, here's the short version:
The price will increase from 12USD/month to 20USD/year.
As originally written above, the price will be 17.99 USD/year just like the other Nintendo services. The new price will go from 20USD/month to 25USD/year.
It's a very important measure to make Nintendo games available. It is a good measure that they made the right call with the price change.
The same will happen to the movies in the future to give reasons why they pulled the paywall.
Now the big news is the upcoming movie on March 19th, where we will see Nintendo Online joining the Movies subscription service. This is the big thing that will force the price to go up to 17.99 USD/year, and in the coming months the price will increase to 25USD/year.
-----
Vishmarx: Good. Simple.
-----
Hoo-doo: I never knew that the price went up. I always assumed it would go up eventually, but I never got why it was a thing.
The change is pretty monumental, I have no idea why they even bothered to do this.

Now, the site updated with details on Hoshiro's story and the first part of Part 2.
-----

CannonFodder52: Yeah, Henashi's a neat guy but I don't think he's the most accomplished writer.

He's currently working on a sequel, but it's a mystery.

CannonFodder52: The mystery hasn't been solved yet.

CannonFodder52: I am going to read this now.
-----
TheManWhoSoldVG: Love me some Hoshiro but I'm just not feeling the damn series. I hated Hoshiro back then. I hope the gatcha company doesn't do a sequel now.
-----
Strings: Hosh was my jam. Some of the manga I've loved in the 90s were adapted completely from the anime, and even then, Hosh was just more of the same, and the interactions between the 2 were fine.
As for the series, I'm still not done with the first game. The second game had a lot of potential, but it's been so ridiculously overused.

They decided to use the Remake engine for NT's version of FFVII instead.

-----
Frecklestein: It's been a few years since I played the game to play with my son.

~!~What's the best way to get into the DMC series?

mogster7777: i’d say just jump in. Its not as hard as some people say it is, the difficulty is low and the bosses are really... I remember reading online that DMC1 was difficult but DMC2 was actually easy? That’s what i wanted to know. So what’s the best way to get into the series? I remember playing DMC1 on PS1 and thinking “this is bullshit”, then playing DMC2 on PS2 and finding it way more difficult than the original. I remember being a little bit pissed off because i thought it was “this is how i should play' but it’s just a little bit harder. I also heard that some fans say that they like DMC3 because it’s more “challenge” and thats which is why i havent tried the ps1 version. So now i just wanna play the games and not have to wait for updates.
I remember reading that DMC1 was a bit difficult back then but i got it at that time and it was a bit of a struggle. Some say that it was easier back then but not now and it’s not that hard, you just gotta learn how to play the games. I was playing Bayonetta on PS1 and really liking it and when i got it I was addicted to the combat.
I remember the first time i played Bayonetta on PS1 was just after the first DLC came out and it was pretty fun but the game was very hard to play since you basically needed the meds to beat it. I tried out the extra missions a few times but stopped after the first boss. I was so into this game that i actually played the DLC for it and enjoyed it. I played the first few levels and liked it but then fell off. Not wanting to be missing out on any more DLC i just quit.
So now i am looking for games like this and honestly i don’t even know what the best way to play them is. I’m gonna go with Devil May Cry 1.
I remember playing this demo on PS1 and being blown away by the graphics and gameplay and now this? I remember thinking it looks beautiful. I’m playing on action so there must be no shortage of action games.

~!~I miss the old days of Neo Geo Tabletop Games

Wamb0wneD: I'm not a huge fan of tabletop games. I don't have a ton of time to game, and even when I do, I tend to be terrible at it (I usually get bored). It's been over 2 years since the last Neo Geo entry in the series. I'm really hoping we get a new entry in the series, because I really want to see what Neite Engine 4 can do with a modern engine.
Any good suggestions? I don't have a ton of money, so I don't really have time.
-----
Eolz: I guess you can only have one sprite, and you can have a bunch of them, right?
Also, for those interested, the first Neite engine game released was this NES game called Neo Geo Tabletop Racer.
-----
chronic_archaic: The best (and current most popular) versions are pretty much all over the place now. The Neo Geo has a few but not enough. I'd suggest Kirby's Tilt (which can be played on your PC with a key, and is also pretty good) if you can find a good key gimmick that makes it play just like a point and click. If you can find a good key gimmick to play like a point and click, really anything.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I prefer to play less table top games, and more sprite based, since I don't use my PC for gaming anymore.
I play 1887 on PC, and it is definitely a great game. I went back to it at least once a decade or so when I sold the old cart business to Eidos.
-----
Charamiwa: I play a LOT. I was a Nintendo VN guy when we got my PS3 and 90's love was out. I find myself still playing my handhelds and PS2 discs. 
I am so drawn to the sprites and colours of the board games that I play like nothing before.

~!~The Furi is the best soundtrack in a fighting game and one of my favorite genre characters

SolVanderlyn: For those who don't know, the Furi is a chk. It's a trogress, but the melodic style still draws me in, and the songs are excellent. In fact, I'm the kind of person who grew up hearing them play in Zelda and Fire Emblem. The catchy music fits the vibe, and it really sells on the first page of this site, since most people don't even know about it.
I haven't played a FighterZ game in a while, so I'm not really sure if the music is really the best in the series. I think it doesn't get mentioned enough.
Let's talk about the music in the Furi.
First, listen to the first 15-20 seconds of the first boss fight. The music is fantastic, and the music in the fight is so energetic. The theme is very nostalgic, and it draws me in instantly, and everything is still in game. The fact that the boss fight theme is still in game and played in-game is a banger.
Let's talk about the music in the second stage of the fight.
The music in the second stage is great. It's the first time that I hear the music in a fighting game, and it's still a masterpiece. The fight itself takes about 5-10 minutes, but it's so exciting that I'm already dancing to it every time.
This is probably the most impressive thing I've heard in fighting games, as the music is just phenomenal. The boss battle theme is still in my head to this day, and I can't wait to get to it.
One of my faves.
The boss fight is so exciting. It has some great music, and I'm absolutely loving it.
I haven't heard the "gonna be this fight your first time" music in a fighting game before.

~!~In the Name of Lord/Lady, Am I the Only One to Have the Power to Change the Official Chances Based on Race and Class?

Phantom Thief: I'm not the biggest fan of this kind of data collection, but I've always been fascinated with tidbits of lore and character development.
For instance, in Morrowind, the Pontifex of Novigrad had a completely different take on race and a totally different take on race and a totally different take on race.
In Oblivion, the Hogans are elves of Novigrad, and the Imperials are primals of Lothric.
In both of these games, there are times when races are defined based on their race (in both cases as a matter of parity within the world) and time, but when the race is based only on one of these two, they can't change the existing times based on class (which is just an example of how important race class is in the world of Bethesda games).
In each of these cases, however, they cannot change the times where they can correctly predict the races based on class.
In the case of Oblivion, the Imperial race have a higher testicle size, which allows them to correctly rule them out of the race. In the case of Skyrim, the Imperial Race are shorter (5”) while the Imperial Race are 5”.
In a similar vein, if you are going to use race and time to rule the Oblivion world, you need to use both to rule in it off-set. If you are going to use time and place to make the world believable, what are you gonna be doing with the time and place?
-----
Spooky_Lantern: I am not the only one.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, that's what I’m looking for, hence the poll. Just give us a reason to exist and a reason to not be ruled out.
-----
Much: Thanks. Will do.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’ll see what I can do.
-----
entremet: I've always liked the idea of a race thing. Not only to rule out the other person, but to give the other race a reason to exist.
It can be done in any of the following ways:
1) By making them raceable.
2) By testing the system to see if it can be used correctly

Kinsei: Personally I'm looking forward to this game. It's the first time since Brawl that Smash Bros. had a direct. I think at least one of the major Nintendo franchises had done a direct. I also understand that Smash Directs are usually more divisive since they often fail to live up to the hype. However, I don't think that it would be a bad idea to have some fan service trailers/demos popping up.
What do you think, ERA? Is this just another Smash Direct? Do you think the new Smash Bros. game will be announced at this yet unknown Direct?

WonderLuigi: I don't think there's any way it's official yet.
-----
Kinsei: I don't get why the new Smash Bros game is just being announced for the very first time. It's like they think we'll get another Smash direct next month.
-----
Zalman: I don't think you can make a direct out of a Brawl Smash.
-----
Dark Cloud: I’m sure it’ll be at E3.
-----
BDS: I'm going to assume it's just for the Smash direct.
-----
Cerium: It's a response to a question regarding Smash Bros. Directs.

~!~What happened to the hotseat game?

Shatty McKracken: I remember hearing about the popular hotseat game on Twitch back in the day and messing around with it and messing around with it a bit. It seemed neat but I remember hearing it was a bit buggy and it was a bit buggy compared to the original Hotseat. 
That being said, I got back into it a bit recently and it's still pretty buggy. The hotseat missions are really fun and I love it. 
I hear the free v-bucks are great as well. 
Anybody have any ideas?
-----
Maxey: That's a really neat idea.
-----
Maxey: Thanks for the suggestion.

~!~Star Citizen Fans: "I want to see another Star Citizen, day one purchase."

Richter1887: I thought this was interesting.
People seem to hate this franchise forever aside from it being one of the most watched games on Youtube.
But I think from here on people will want Star Citizen again.
-----
Omar310: I think this is the first time I'm hearing about a buy from someone.
-----
Maneil99: I would love to buy it but I dont think I would.
-----
Richter1887: I think all the sites that are popular will gravitate towards it.
-----
RagdollRhino: Yes please. It has the best open world game of the generation and I think it will be my GOTY.
-----
texhnolyze: It's already here, right?
Just reading the comments makes me think it's very close to that.
-----
Dancrane212: Is this game worth a mid tier purchase for the PS4 or is this a game that will fly off the shelves?
-----
Maneil99: I would buy it but I’m not sure I would, especially with the vast ocean of options you can save money with the sea of ships.
-----
Richter1887: That is a good point as other times that have made it a top 10 game have polluted my gaming life.
-----
RagdollRhino: It's a great game but if I had to choose it's very hard.

====================
~!~Obscure PS4 games?

jrush64: I've been looking for a decent PS4 game that isn't super janky or unappealing to the casual gamer like Spider-Man. I really like the stealth elements in the stealth in the last few games and I feel like the Spider-Man games are the best ones. I'm looking for something a little bit more polished. Something like the Call of Duty games or Assassin's Creed. I typically don't like Sony games and this game seems to fit that bill. Has anyone played any of their own titles?
-----
DecoReturns: I've always enjoyed the Uncharted games. 
Spider-Man is a little bit janky in the stealth part but overall I really like the stealth. I don't think it's as janky as some other games. 
I haven't played the other Uncharted games though.
-----
Zushin: The Last of Us, Bloodborne, and Uncharted 4 are all great games, but Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is one of the best games I've ever played. The combat is fantastic. The gunplay is great. The story is brilliant.
-----
TheBaldwin: GoW, GT Sport, Botw, GT6, Horizon, Horizon 2 and 3, and Bloodborne are all the best. I would recommend every one, but Uncharted 4 is a god tier game. 
Also you mentioned Uncharted 4. I think you should play it, it's a fantastic game.
-----
Cess007: Mario Odyssey
Nier and Persona 5
-----
WesleyShark: Uncharted.
-----
Cess007: The Last of Us
-----
NKnight7: I remember being pretty interested in Bloodborne but it has aged a bit and I don't think I like it. 
I'd say every game that you can play in 4K.
-----
BrickArts295: Definitely Uncharted 4. Felt the game had a lot of jank and it's pretty cheap.

~!~Does this happen with all Nintendo games?

ElectricBlanketFire: I'm wondering since I have a Switch and I wanted to play Smash, should I just play a single player game or invest time in a multiplayer game?
-----
Jaded Alyx: I mean Smash bros.
-----
BDS: What's the point of this thread?
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I'll be playing Smash bros.
-----
Nuclear Muffin: Smash bros.
You’re not going to like it, you’re going to be disappointed.
-----
Yerba_Sutra: Smash bros. Even if it's a single player game.
-----
Yopis: Also, if you get a friend to play with, Smash bros and local multiplayer would be fun with them. But ever since I started gaming I have found Smash to be a tad easy to fool if I want to with friends playing and I still find it hard to get into the game.
-----
Dark Cloud: Smash bros.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Seriously. I'm playing Smash.
-----
Aters: Smash bros. You'll fall in love with it.

~!~Is the DMC5 demo the best version of DMC2?

King of Dreamland: (From other members here)
Now, despite DMC2's failure many people consider it the best version of this game. I've played it since launch, and it's not even the best version since, and there are many bad glitches, but I've enjoyed it since I started playing.
I've heard the demo uses a lot of outdated and homophobic shit, so I've been wondering: is this the best version of the game?
I've heard the demo has some frame rate issues, but I believe that's not the case at all.
The demo uses a bunch of shit, but again, I believe it's not the best version of the game (probably because I've only played the demo twice), but I would recommend giving it a play if you can.
-----
The Last One: DMC2 is the best version, even better than the original.
-----
Ferrs: Its the original but with more animations, better graphics and the better atmosphere.
-----
Sargerus: The original one looks worse in the PC version than the original.
-----
King of Dreamland: Thanks, I'll ask this in the thread.
-----
Strings: The demo is actually pretty terrible, don't get me wrong - it's the best version of the game IMO.
-----
entremet: I don't know if this is relevant to this thread, but the demo is so awful that the PC version is almost a certainty with the same 30fps as the PC version.
-----
Ferrs: PC version has quite a bit of frame rate drops on PC, especially on things like multi impact dodge offset (got me and a friend who played the demo) but at least it's the best version.
-----
ShiningSolaris: From the demo I heard it’s the best version of DMC2.
-----
butman: Dmc2 is the best version.

~!~The Evil Within 2: The Game that Just Made Me Stop

Skaterboy: I was so excited for this game and the first one. I was so ready to play it.
I put the first game down for awhile. I just got over the first level. Then, I got the OK for the second level. Put it down for a long time. Then, I got the OK for the third level. Then, I got the OK for the fourth level.
I started to fall. I fell so hard it hurt my right hand sometimes, and I had to stop playing. I had no desire to play this on PC. Then, I had to go and get a new PC. Then, I got a new monitor. I left my Steam save file on there, but I’d still be able to return it and finish it with the Steam release.
It was a tough time. I put about 20 hours into the first game but loved it. I felt like this was a game I should give a chance to explore more. I enjoyed the game and the first one. I liked the characters and the story. I liked the gameplay. I liked the atmosphere and the story. I liked that the second game had more depth and I liked that the game had a few different endings. 
The first game was a highlight for me. One of the most satisfying horror titles I’ve ever played. I loved every moment. The atmosphere, the characters, the story. The atmosphere was tense and it felt epic. I had to get the PS4 to play it, because I couldn’t get the PS4 version since my launch version of the game. 
The gameplay was fun, and it felt good. I loved the atmosphere and the story. 
The game was also rather scary. The last time I ran out of ammo after running into a room full of Scarecrow things or running in front of a tank. 
The game was an epic finale. I went in expecting a few things, but the story, going through hell walls, I was not expecting it to be. 
The atmosphere was great. The music was good. The atmosphere was real. I got a bit nervous at the end. I loved it and I loved the music. That’s why I put it down.
I’m gonna be so pissed when it doesn’t release in the summer.

~!~I'm still confused about Tetris 99

Vire: I'm still confused about Tetris 99. There is no tutorial and you can never get the item you need in order to win. Everything unlocked in the game is unlocked in game.
Why is this even a thing? Are you even supposed to use all the items? The endgame introduces you to all the game's amazing mechanics. What exactly does this game even mean? It's just a game with a winning AI.
I'm not even sure what to think about it.
-----
hydrophilic attack: i was confused since i was a very young kid
but i remember thinking it was a pretty good game
-----
Dyle: It's a pretty good game. It has a substantial endgame and its a more interesting and complex game than the traditional one
-----
jakoo: And yet it never had a tutorial?
-----
Lichtsang: It's a pretty good game. I don't think it has a good endgame. The endgame is huge and has a lot of emergent mechanics that you can't get anywhere else. Tetris 99 is kind of an excellent example of this.
-----
kitsuneyo: I'd be more interested in playing a game that you as a player are already familiar with.
If you want a game to not exist, I'd recommend a game that you've played before.
-----
skeezx: i don't see how that's a comparable game to Tetris. it's a pretty good game but i think it's a little short and not as fulfilling as tetris
-----
Lindsay: I like the game it's meant to be played with. The endgame is pretty unique (gives you a bunch of easy styles and great games to play).
-----
Vire: Yeah I'm also looking forward to it.

LiK: I tried to like this game as a kid but the last few events I tried were on the world map. I remember liking that.

~!~Red Dead Redemption 2: The Game Has To Reach The Universal Digital-Era Speed

Phantom Thief: Reading this now, but I'm already fairly certain RDR2 is taking near the universal digital-to-an-universal-speed in reaching its 2.5D reach. I've been playing the game for two hour stretches, and it feels like the game is never getting close to the universal speed of its predecessor. I feel like this is the game that's best positioned to accrue the digital-digital-to-an-universal-speed, so it should be able to do that in its own way. 
The base game for Redemption 2 is $36.99 on PSN right now, and it's already $40 on PC this week before a sale, so I don't see why it's going to cost 60 bucks. The base game will cost $29.99, which means the digital-only game will cost you about 25 bucks. 
I also don't think I've ever seen this being used in a game where the base game is $60, and that's on PSN here. I also don't think this is a thing where the game itself is the base game, so I don't know if this is a common issue here. 
Furthermore, I think that this is going to be the first time this happens with a Rockstar game, where they have to drop off the digital-digital-an-wide-speed of access. 
I'm pretty sure this is the reason why RDR2 is a bit, uh, downgraded. 
So, with that said, I think it's important to not just discuss this, but discuss how we could possibly go about transitioning towards a Rockstar future, one based on open world realism, one based on Rockstar franchises in general, and one that has a very steep uphill battle to climb in today's climate. 
What do you think? Do you think it'll work? Or do you think it'll cost too much to make?
-----
Shaquille Hunter: It will. 
I think we'll be moving towards a future where every game needs to be at least half on par with GTA. This is a tough place to be in to be a business. 
As long as the online component is robust and works well, I think we're all for it.

~!~Year of Luigi 2018 - Celebrating 35 Years of the King of 2D Platformers

Dancrane212: New to the new year, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate the birthday of one of the greatest 2D platformers of all-time. The King of All-Terrain games is approaching 35 years old this time and with it comes the Year of Luigi.
The first installment in the series, it was released exclusively in Dreamcast for the Dreamcast and PS (the first game in the series was originally a Sega game in the first series). Luigi was a man of no sense, he was always tasked with protecting Peach from Radical 3 and all the villains in his way. Luigi's sense of justice was earned, he was a noble hero of the dead and had a hand-picked legacy, Luigi's fearless journey to the darkest dungeons was rewarding, Luigi could have gone through 5 games in the franchise in the 3rd series and none of them had a chance of ever happening.
The game takes place in the Sand Kingdom, a lush kingdom at the top of the Cap Kingdom that is at the top of the seas, churning with the occasional storm. The Cap Kingdom itself is a small kingdom with a population of around 400 that have all the sense of wonder, adventure, hope and Adventure that comes with being a kingdom of adventure and exploration. The Sand Kingdom is home to many of Luigi's greatest abilities, like Glide & Jump, as well as Glide dash which is a wickedashing move that makes you slide and fly freely far faster than the slower slide of other skills. Luigi can perform this move alone in the Cap Kingdom, you'll be pirating every move Luigi touches throughout the game.
The Sand Kingdom itself also houses many of the hardest levels in the entire series. There are bosses like Bowser Jr. and the Painted Tower House that require you to perfect their patterns or watch their weak spots. There are also secret areas like the Flying Balloon or the Waterfall Pot that reward your hard work.
The second game in the series takes place in the post-Galaxy Kingdom, a kingdom far away, far away future. The Sand Kingdom itself is far, far away, and has a much darker and darker history than the Sand Kingdom. There's a sense of mystery that permeates every level that permeates the entire kingdom, the story, the meaning behind every conversation, the meaning behind what keeps you going, the meaning behind

~!~Have you played any of the "Only Gims" games?

Deeke777: I saw this super weird and good compilation of the Sims stuff at a store today and thought it was neat.
-----
Powdered Egg: I did.
-----
mrjohill: I have, but I really don’t give a shit about the series.
-----
Zacmortar: I wish I had, but I can't. I love the Sims but I'm not into the whole catalog being a collection all the time.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I did.
I'm playing it through subbed.
-----
Lonely1: Aha, did not see this thread.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I played the first one. Never got that far, but I guess I don't mind it if it's for a compilation.

====================
~!~What is everyone's stance on the genre?

TheBaldwin: It seems like we are stuck in this weird time where we play a lot of games ranging from simulation to heavy metal and then there are somthing else on sale like the new Bullfrog game. 
We see a lot of games like that get a Dark Souls or Gears of War reception, or a Destiny, a lot of games that get recommended to us that just make it a genre that we can just jump in with, and a lot of games like that. 
So is everyone stance on that genre? 
What do you think is everyone's stance on that genre?
-----
TheBaldwin: I dunno, I feel like it's really the only gaming genre I can get into. Especially mobile games, I play tons of mobile but one of my biggest pet peeves with the genre is the genre itself. 
I love when genres like survival horror and looter-based titles come out and stuff like that, but it's so weird to see so few developers try to tackle those kinds of genres. 
I feel like it's all about the genre and the dev time, I feel like it's really weird to see so few games tackle those genres.
-----
Kokonoe: I feel like it would be super weird to see a AAA game do all the crafting, The Division, Destiny, etc. in a shooter.
-----
TheBaldwin: I mean, when you see it in action it kind of bums me out, but I agree it seems like it would be really niche to where the majority of developers don’t even try to tackle that genre.
-----
Flux: I agree. I think the AAA needs to be more like what people consider AAA.
-----
HououinKyouma00: I don’t think AAA developers should touch other games. I’m okay with a few more AAA titles.
-----
Dervius: It's weird to see games like Fortnite and FFXIV come even remotely close to the types of games AAA publishers do.
-----
TheBaldwin: I mean, I do see the point, but I feel like they will just stick to the same fun activities and core gameplay and not have that core gameplay change over time, it happens all the time. 
Like I think the game play that comes

~!~Theory: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Remake Remake Dimensions, Closes Platform Game?

OwOtacon: What do you think this could mean? Will it just be a remaster of sorts like Breath of the Wild? If not, what about the remake?
Personally, I think it could be a Breath of the Wild entry. I remember people being concerned about the power connection the cart needed to go from the Master Sword to Link's Awakening. However, I think it could work within the rules of the original series. It could be a much much more streamlined game.
Some of the information we have:
Thoughts?
-----
Platy: It means more than "a remake of a game that was never good"
Like, wtf
-----
LavaBadger: I think the exact same thing would be said of Splatoon 2 at this point.
-----
OwOtacon: Yeah, that's part of what I was talking about.
-----
o k: i’m not sure if it would even work considering how they previously used the Master Sword to connect the Master Sword to Link’s Awakening.
-----
OwOtacon: I think they might still use the same engine for the 2D assets, but I can't see them changing that.
-----
WonderLuigi: it would require them to make an entirely new game, so no. but that would be the most surprising news imo
-----
Hero of Legend: Will they go with the engine they used for Breath of the Wild? They've been doing their own thing with their engine since Ocarina of Time.
-----
OwOtacon: It'd be cool to see the engine used in the NieR Automata remake as well. Though the engine in Ocarina of Time was quite efficient, so that could be a pleasant surprise.
-----
ScreamingMadden: I think they’d get away with using the engine they used for the original game. I think they’d be fine with it.
-----

====================
~!~I don’t want to hear about the console war

Phantom Thief: Okay, let’s start off by acknowledging the war has been ongoing for ten years now. The war is, at its core, a global war. Wars are everywhere, from Taiwan to the one that broke out in the immediate wake of the Nintendo Switch's launch, and the consequence was that the very only units that are remotely able to win wars are basically the ones that were bombed on.
The reason this isn’t different than any other time is because war games are fundamentally about forces not normally in control. Things are going to break up when there are no guarantees of independence. There is a war, and the only thing that can guarantee that war will break out will be if there are enough soldiers on the field that can rush into action and stabilize the world at a reasonable pace, or something like that. This is not something that happens to any other country, and even if it did, there’d still a better chance of a victory for the United States than you might have if you didn’t have a weapon of war.
So if you think about it, if an enemy is not currently in control of the situation, chances are it’ll be better to be out of control. That’s why we have to be wary of virtual war games, honestly. They can be blowing up, but we’re setting forests up for terrorists to shoot at one of our allies. If they’re hiding from your army, they can be blowing up their army, and if they’re behind our back, I’m just going to step on you.
This isn’t to say games are being designed to replicate real-world situation, or that war games are less effective at this than other games; this is more likeists using strategies to manipulate reality.
Imagine if a real-world situation arose in the middle of a game and the enemy tanks your position, launches missiles at your and your guys, then retreats afterwards, then attack you real-ly. In the real world, this wouldn’t be a problem, because everything is already lined up in the real world. Imagine that happens. They attack you. In the fiction, it would be the same. In the reality, they are different. They are preparing their ambush, their attack, their attack, their move, and their action
====================
~!~F2P MMOs: What do you think will happen next?

Kraken3dfx: With the upcoming launch of F2P games like Warframe, We Happy Few and Hellblade getting the AAA treatment and the clear legalization of GaaS, things are looking/hoping that the MMO market will take over and cater to both the new and old.
Personally, if the above was the case and it was already confirmed to happen, what would you want changed?
Personally I'd like them to stay F2P and make their games 1 by 1 multiplayer competitive like Path of Exile.
I'd like them to remain a GaaS juggernaut and make games that are fun, engaging, and worthwhile. So many of my favorite things to do in MMOs are done by the MMO community and if they could only make one, it would be them.
I would just love for a F2P MMO to make a spiritual successor to Diablo, with the closest thing to being proper PvP in a MMO yet and no loot-PVP.
I'd also love for them to explore other MMOs like Path of Exile and other new games like Diablo.
Though I do acknowledge that there's a market for F2P MMOs, and that there's a lot of potential for massive success and there's no perfect solution to be had.
What do you think Era? Would you want F2P MMOs to remain a GaaS juggernaut and make games that are fun, engaging, and worthwhile?
-----
Sindee: No.
-----
sibarraz: Is there a free form fighting game that can be played with my phone?
But yeah, I love the F2P model so yes
-----
ILikeFeet: F2P MMOs are more likely to develop and finish. MMOs don't need to take their time to make
-----
sibarraz: Yes, we should be able to make free-form F2P games that work in a competitive sense and not like mobile games where you can just queue into any server and play with anyone
-----
Kaz Mk II: I'd be cool with them making F2P MMOs on top of cosmetic microtransactions. You can pay to keep playing and you get advantages like being able to make money from buying cosmetic items or having an army of robots and have them try to pick you up and drop

-----
D4rth Man7iz: Doom 2016 easily. My god, the tension.

~!~Just bought a Xbox One X for the first time and own the best GTA ever.

chronic_archaic: I've been a PS fan for a very long time, but I just got a Xbox One for Black Friday and I'm getting back into GTA. I've been playing it with all the DLC and mods I've installed since GTAV. I love the open world and the open world GTA, but it's a bit rough. I'm kind of liking the change to day and night cycle better. The missions are all pretty boring but the open world is still pretty fun. I like the increased stealth difficulty. I'm going to be really biased towards the PC version.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Just bought it for it and it's worth it.
If you're a fan of GTA or open world games it's all you need.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Yeah, I feel this is one of those games where I think it's the best game I've played in the last five years. It's just a much better game than Vice City, which had better open world mechanics, and also had a much better atmosphere in some parts. The best GTA ever, in my opinion.
-----
Duffking: I really like it, but I have to agree. The game is a legitimately great ride. I didn't mind the difficulty spikes but the controls and map design were archaic and the sheer novelty of the game put me off.
-----
HeisenbergWW62: I love the game and I have yet to beat it but i will be getting it on the X
-----
TheThreadsThatBindUs: I think it's a great game.
I think it's a bit rough in that it basically feels like GTA but with a bit more polish, too.
I've been a PS person for a very long time, but I have a lot of gripes with the controls and map design, and some of the missions are really dull. But it's a damn fine GTA.
-----
BocoDragon: I was really surprised to hear that it was coming to the X, so now I have to wait for the X to show off the X. I didn’t think it would be obvious from the information I heard, especially with the announcement of the previous GTA, Red Faction, and Red Faction Battle Royale games.

~!~Can you play a game in late evenings and early morning?

daripad: Itching some nostalgia. I'm looking for something to play during my work week. I'm not typically into latenight and late evenings gaming, but I have been craving a good time lately.
I'm not opposed to playing late hours or even early morning either, and I'm really not looking for a game to play on those hours. I have the following smorgasbords:
Mario Odyssey
Ori
Fortnite
Monster Hunter World
Overcooked 2
Fortnite: Special Edition
Bayonetta 1 & 2
Monster Hunter World 2
Battlefield 1
Hellblade
Dark Souls Remastered
I am also on my phone and don't really have a lot of time to play these things. I have some spare time tonight and a few more things to take advantage of. I'm looking for a game that has a good story and is relaxing and doesn't require too much gaming. It can also be single and multiplayer
-----
VonGreckler: Yes
-----
NoKisum: Yo why are you always late? Why play late?
-----
oneils: I think it depends what kind of game you want to play, but this is more of a RPG preference for me. Usually only play late at night so sleep is important. I love being late, but I dread getting up and playing late.
-----
stumblebee: I play late to play games. I like playing late to bad. I don't usually play with a heavy feeling of dread.
-----
kennyamr: Are you looking for a game that doesn't require too much gaming time?
-----
TheRulingRing: I have a few of them.
I like to play late, I like to play early, but sometimes I play late as much as late otherwise.
I'm also a fan of the "soft" late nights that have no sound, and can be played during the day on PC.
-----
Robinson: Persona 5
-----
Cordy: I play late to play games. Then when I get home I play late.

~!~LTTP: The Witcher Blood & Wine

Vipu: In this past week, I have had myself a new tv and a ps4 pro and after playing the new Tomb Raider and Resident Evil 2 reminded me of the Witcher 3, I decided to go and experience these two games properly.
First of all I wanted to say a big Thank you to CD project RED and their passion for open world, fantasy and sci-fi movies so hard that they gave me the opportunity to give these games 4 stars.
So without further ado here is the adventure I had playing this game.
From beginning to end this game is breathtaking. The exploration, the quests, the quests, is masterclass. In fact, one of the reasons I love the game so much is because of the amazing storytelling and questing choices made by the characters. But the game never fails to be a disappointment at the best moments.
This is just my opinion but I feel it is a good ass game that I deserve to replay.
I really love the seamless world between world and city. The way the main routes merge into one place, the quiet side of the city is great and I feel it takes inspiration from some of other city simulators like Liberty City but with a more open and less tedious design.
I think the main flaw I have with this game is that it doesn't really reward you with skillfull builds like in 3. You can say whatever you want but there isnt much to deglder than gathering a few skillpoints and then upgrading your weapons to max out your strength, that is all you really need to enjoy the game.
Also the way you start quests is so completely random. You have no idea how much wood to wood on the enviroment until you see it to the point that you have to start with. That is a huge problem in open world games because theres often an ancillary resource to start with and then get more resources and go your slow and methodical path.
But even then there are a lot of random tasks you have to do that will min

I'm just going to say thank you for reminding me of my favorite game, The Witcher 3, and I can't wait to play it when I have more time.

~!~New to PC Games

TheBeardedOne: Is there any way to play games like Civilization or Lego games on PC? I have a GTX 1080 and it's probably the best CPU available. I'm running the recommended drivers for most games that are using GSync.
Any tips or tricks I should know?
Thanks.
-----
Dusktildawn48: You have to enable the AMD support in the GPU drivers, which is important for PC gaming.
-----
TheBeardedOne: I'm getting an Intel Core i7-7700HQ.
I'm using the highest settings.

~!~Halo MCC Insider Program Announced

Dancrane212: Just announced on the Halo MCC Insider stream. Will be available to download for free next week.
-----
Theorry: Downloading now.
-----
Regiruler: Finally.
-----
Railgun: Awesome! Downloading now
-----
Gestault: The MCC Insider program is great, but it's a bit sad that they're not being asked to hold a public demo on Test Realm.
-----
NSA: Just in time for the MCC Insider program.
-----
Dancrane212: They're also doing a public demo so there's that.
-----
Railgun: I got the impression that they want to gauge interest in the MCC before committing to a demo. But the likely scenario is that there's some maintenance to be done and testing is not finished for a while.
-----
Railgun: I mean I downloaded the preview code, but I was about to just do the foundational stuff but begrudgingly, looks like it will be a really good demo.
-----
Saint-14: What about the Preview stuff?

~!~What is the best way to legally share Xbox 360/DualShock controllers across the entire family?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I'm a huge DualShock fan. I used to play my Xbox 360 controller religiously with friends at the Xbox party at PAX East. I'd always bring it with me for the games I was playing or just the endless chill. I've *always* thought it should be possible to just keep the old ones with the extra shoulder buttons and stuff, but the original Xbox 360 controller is so goddamn gloppy. Not even the shoulder buttons or the triggers or whatever. I'm playing Doom right now and there's a rumble thing in the shoulder, and it's kind of annoying, so I'm trying to put together a legal workaround for that. 
I've been wanting to do a similar thing with my 360 for a while. I've wanted to look at a CRT situation for a while. I already have a 360 controller, but I'm pretty happy with it. I just wonder if my Xbox 360 is starting to glitch. I've been contemplating a second 360 controller, but now I've got that little itch for a remake :D
-----
Theswweet: I have a small but really-good set of 360 controllers. If you can use a third party one that's probably a good option, I think a 360 Wireless Controller or 360 S Controller works great for the best.
-----
hibikase: I have the original Xbox One controller.
-----
RivalGT: Xbox One controller is working just as well.

hibikase: I’m not sure why you’re asking me again but I want to contact the Xbox Support Hotline.
I’m working on getting a third 360 controller, I’m hoping someone here can help.

~!~Honorable Mentions That Could Possibly Go Wrong: Let It Die and Robotte

jett: I mean, just look at these tweets without the bad ones: "I don't have time for that."
I agree with you, the sequels are a very good way to extend the game.
-----
Mediking: Get that baby...

Jayson's Rage: "Let it die" is a better way to put it.
-----
Aniki: Let it die, robotte.
-----
kurahador: Let it die if it exists.

Fat4all: I agree, but I don’t agree that Robotte is the best.

sir_crocodile: The 'Two sequels' problem is always a bad thing
The bad sequels are a good thing for the industry, i think they are a good idea
-----
DGenerator: I don't think the first two sequels are particularly good.
-----
Sylvalum: I don't agree. It's a good game that was kind of forgotten about by the end.

davepoobond: The "let it die" is a good suggestion

~!~We've seen the green/bad news ending of all of Resident Evil's stories.

fireflame: In the Resident Evil franchise, the main protag is the hero of the first two games, with Ada Wong leading the charge for the horror ending. There is no other explanation for this, but the RE2 remake makes it seem like Ada could have easily been killed by a sniper.
What are your thoughts on this? Should the franchise end with a bang?
-----

Strings: Was a big fan of the first two games, but seeing the RE2 remake ending with that dumb helicopter scene really made me go "I WANT THAT ROOM LESS EVERY MORNING" -_-.
-----
Toth: I knew it wouldn't do anything but I thought it was a good move, considering it's just after RE1. I always think they'd wanna do a Code Veronica remake later.
-----
StuBurns: Ada was killed in that school shooting.
-----
LuciusAxelrod: Fuck Jill. She was killed in a plane crash because of how the head transplant was treated. 
Also the Toth from the Resident Evil series.
-----
Dreamboum: The fact that the original RE1 is a remake of the PS1 game is a tragedy.
-----
Cess007: I always loved the idea of Leon coming back and being charged with something.
I really hope RE2 makes a comeback at some point, capcom.
-----
1upsuper: I'm not sure if I need to explain exactly what I'm talking about because it's just one of them.
"You betrayed us. We forgive you." 
I mean, I still think it's an obvious hint to the next game. I'm not sure REmake 3 is even happening and we've heard nothing about it.
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: REmake 3 should probably be a thing, for sure.
If not, I just want Capcom to stop fucking with it and give people the chance they deserve to finish the third game.

~!~How are they supporting Switch at the moment?

mazi: how are they supporting the switch? do they have any games announced?
how is the support? i've heard some games coming in the future but they arent sure about them yet? i've noticed some weird delays, but i'm not sure if this is just me or not.
i'm sure there will be some late ports, but i'm more worried about the long term. i don't trust the eShop and i'm not sure if it's going to be a big improvement over the previous system.
i hear it's a great device with good tech, but i'm not sure if i'll get it, either.
-----
Cartridge Games: Have issues?
Seems a bit rough to compare it to but ports are nice.
-----
KZXcellent: Switch is pretty good when it comes to tech. Some games are still missing. I'd say the Switch is much more stable than previous systems.
-----
Jayson's Rage: There are issues
-----
Juke Joint Jezebel: The Switch is known for its shaky software rep, so I think the majority of those issues aren't really that big of issues.
-----
Cartridge Games: There's a few games people have mentioned that they are unsure of.
Not sure I get the comparison. I do need to play BotW, Splatoon 2 and Smash.
-----
Ababol: I'm not sure Switch is bad, not by a long shot. It's a very capable device that has seen some wild tech abuses and it's still a very good device, and it's not going to ever get replaced.
-----
TheMoon: They're not worried about the hardware side of things. They're concerned about the software.
-----
jariw: They're fairly beefed up. The Switch practically means they have all the same features as the previous model, and it's a damn shame that the launch Joycons haven't changed much even with the new model. 
I'd definitely pick the Switch up if I was in your shoes and had the hardware to play it, but there's no denying that the launch Joycons feel vastly improved and functional.
-----
Forkball: I have an odd relationship with my Switch. I would play it a lot more if I had something similar to play on the system. Zelda OOT is a favourite

~!~VICE: With the rise of microtransactions, how do you feel about the future of RTS games?

Cort: As the title states, I just wanted to take the opportunity to drop some perspective and thought I'd let you guys know how we feel about the future of RTS games.
Here are some hot takes from my own mind back at the table:
The most obvious take is RTS games are dying as a service. Setting aside the recent dominance of microtransactions and MTX, single player, along with online gaas, the traditional, single player model has been so successful that Valve have had no intentions of re-releasing their games for years. There's been talk of The Culling 2 coming soon, but no one knows what The Culling 2 is. Same goes for For Honor and RTS Company 'siege'.
I would have to imagine The Culling 2 is launching late this year, but I have to assume there's still a bit more hope in the air. What do you guys think?
-----
ILikeFeet: Valve will just be another publisher that prints money out of your game. So you either buy Siege packs in the hope of that or Siege 2-2 Premium.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I'm not sure I agree with the majority of your points tbh but I'd love to see The Culling 2 be released earlier.
-----
Pocky4Th3Win: For Honor and Siege 2 Premium would be my preferred release.
-----
60fps: I agree. I’d even say that Valve are just playing games to get more money or some other means to spend it.
-----
skeezx: i mean it's not like they'll get away with it dropping into pre-order chaos
-----
Frostman: I don’t see anything they can do that they weren’t supposed to do. I have no issue with it though.
-----
Nooblet: Siege 2-season pass is a terrible idea imo.
-----
VonGreckler: I agree with you 100%. I don’t know if they can ever really support a new RTS game ever again.
-----
Hektor: You're crazy.
The "Premium" (mechanically) is for purchasing a game itself. The "Order of Ecclesia" (play

~!~Era, what are some good "niche" RPGs?

Kain-Nosgoth: So i'm trying to decide what type of RPG i want to play next, and the only thing i'm gonna do is NOT play 'em ALL! After all these years, i clearly know my Rpgs, and they're always good and unique, so i just went all in on auto combat and character builds!
Usually, i just play the ones i like, and ignore the ones that don't. So, in this case, i have decided to play Chrono Cross, for example.
Of course, there are some games i like, like Trails of the Zodiac or Granblue Fantasy. But these arent worth playing if you are not into RPG's, for example
- FF7 Remake
- Trails of

Kyoufu: This will not do for long.
-----
Omar310: You say you're looking for the best game of the generation. Is there a game you're looking for that you're not interested in or you're too new to the genre?
-----
zsynqx: Chrono Cross is a good one, and I also played the SNES version, so that's not a negative. Also if you can pick up the GBA version, that's great too.
-----
somerandomweirdguy: The original Red Earth is one of my all-time favorite JRPGs. I picked up the PSOne version years ago and just picked it up on Steam recently and had a blast with it. I love the DS version too.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: I just started replaying this game again, I'm quite surprised it's so difficult, i just finished it in one sitting, this time with all the expansions and all the characters, it's so much fun, and i'm a huge fan of the SNES era JRPGs
-----
Ravelle: I'd play something like this:

~!~Resident Evil 7 is not perfect

JK-Money: I have to say that I’m actually really enjoying this game and it’s not even close to perfect.
First off I love the way the environments are designed and it looks stunningly good. 
Also the controls are good. In terms of gameplay there are only 2 in the entire series which is pretty harsh. 
But I think if they keep the same basic puzzles and enemies over the sequels it will be a very different experience.
It really makes me miss the days of the retrogaming era.
-----
Duxxy3: The best RE is 7.
-----
vestan: Don't really have an issue with the game so far. It's still one of my top 5 RE games but this new one has a lot of new shit in the works. I think the lack of new stuff in the new game is partially to do with it being a pre-2019 game.
-----
JK-Money: Kinda tired of the forced fixed camera angle shit and forced tank controls.
-----
SofNascimento: I think the sense of horror in this game is a lot less satisfying than the first two titles. I could see myself playing RE7 more if the quality of life improvements are still there.
-----
SSJDio: I played a bit of this demo last night, but I think the game was a bit too easy for me at times. I can see why, but I can't see myself replaying.
-----
Zacmortar: I agree with you, imo, and I love RE7. It's not perfect, but it is the most terrifying game I've ever seen.
-----
SofNascimento: I saw this footage a few minutes ago, and I agree that the tank controls are a little wonky. But I think they are actually quite helpful for survival horror. I think the game was still tense after all the scares had passed me by.
-----
UnluckyKate: I loved the tank controls in the original RE7. It was such a big difference to me that I didn't even own the original RE2 for years. 
But this remake, I'm really happy about, and it looks amazing, even better than the first.
RE2 remake is going to be even better than the original RE7.

~!~Just bought an Xbox and a PS4, what should I play first?

Thewonandonly: So I’ve been getting back into the hobby of playing video games with a group of friends and I was wondering what the general consensus is on these games. I’m mainly talking about PS4 games but I know there’s other ones too. What’s the general consensus? I haven’t played any games on either system since the 360 or PS3.
-----
Cisce: Destiny is better than it was at launch, but still very Destiny-y.
In terms of story, the games just aren't for me. I've played "content"’s but I feel they should be played in order. I don’t find the game itself highly enjoyable, but the "story" is a lot more involved than the relatively short ones. It’s the fact that the game is structured like it’s supposed to be and that makes it harder for me to enjoy playing through it.
-----
Doukou: Destiny is awful. You can’t fight the enemies. They can’t. The game is hard. You have to use guns. You have to use special abilities. You have to use the guns. You have to use magic. There’s no place to play the game. 
Not to mention the story is awful.
-----
Thewonandonly: So in Destiny you can kill npc and loot your stuff? I know that’s not that bad but man the story just isn’t for me. I heard a lot of it on reddit but I’m not sure. How do I play? Is there a way to turn off team attacks and focus on killing op?
-----
Kolx: Destiny isn't as good as the older Destiny games. The new ones are a lot better in most aspects.
-----
Aokiji: Destiny is awful. The new one is better but the old one is great.
-----

====================
~!~Anyone ever had this problem with their ps4 clicking into XBL?

nib95: It never had any issue with it clicking into a different controller. I've had mine since launch and it's been fine ever since.
Is there a trick I'm unaware of to fix this? I have seen solutions like this but I'm always hesitant to use them.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Does it work as well as it does?
-----
nib95: I don't think it works that well, but I'm not sure how far you are in that regard. At least not in the sense of it always clicking into controllers.
-----
Oreoleo: Yes, it will work. It works on Xbox and works for me.

Kyoufu: oh god.

~!~Are you missing the graphical leap in graphical fidelity seen in the current generation?

Vaelic: nvidia and amd are in a battle of the worth and power.
where does it RIKU starting with the jump to 3D?
-----
Mizzourah: Yes, I agree. The jump is massive.
-----
KillerMan91: The leap to 3D is nothing but a monumental achievement.
-----
AxeVince: The point in switching the image quality to match the industry standard is "additional graphical capabilities" - which is why not just having a checkerboard filter with multiple comparisons between various samples (as in, native 4K with checkerboard rendering) is the "graphics" leap.
The output of checkerboard rendering in a console is ~14 frames, up from ~2.7 - 4.2 frames.
To be fair, the image quality difference is much smaller than that for checkerboard rendering, to some extent.
-----

D65: I'm not sure why you think the resolution of the current consoles could be higher than what we'd be seeing in this thread.
Maybe the sky is flat.
-----
LordKano: The only thing that makes it more impressive is the fact that it's not going to be quite the same we'd been getting for years now.
-----
Mondy: The leap to 3D is nothing more than a monumental achievement.
-----
Rineol: It’s probably nothing more than open up your mind to possible benefits to be seen in a new generation, but I honestly have no clue. Any additional benefit I’m seeing is just about making me think twice about not buying a new PC this year.

~!~RTTP: The Witcher 3 (long and drawn out spoilers)

The perfect Dark: OPEN SPOILERS
I’m going through this game first
I love the game. I’m finished with it. I have really high expectations for the DLC. I’m excited for what the final DLC brings to the table.
I have no idea if I can complete all the shrines and most of the main quests in the DLC. I really hope it’s not too much of a grind.
Most of my main issues with the game are its combat. It’s just a really bad combat system.
I do not understand how anyone can enjoy this game.
-----
Ahasverus: Well yeah, Witcher 3 is one of the best games of all time.
It's one of the best RPGs ever made.
I'd probably even give it another go.

~!~They are selling the Sega Saturn in China, Korea, Japan, or Substanania.

Jawmuncher: This is interesting to me because I was just looking at the prices of the Sega Saturn in different Asian regions. And the top 3 titles on the Saturn in different regions are all of them Saturns.
I guess it's not too much to ask to sell the legacy console to the highest bidder. Especially since Sega can't make anything cheaper. But the interesting bit is the correlation of the Sega Saturn and the Sega Saturn in different Asian countries. Since Sega doesn't have a single version of the console made by Sega in different regions.
Now onto the correlation.

-----
nachum00: That's a lot of numbers for Sega. Ah well, I’m in.

kubev: The Sega Saturn doesn't make a box, it's a variant of the Saturn TV, which was the original model. The imported Saturn box look absolutely awful, and I can't believe they'd give a zero to produce a console that doesn't feature a Saturn tv.

The Dude: I have a wii U and it's such a joy to play. I'm just not very impressed with the layout and some of the buttons. I can't even imagine what the rumble is like. I had a good laugh guessing that it was just Wiimote. 
I've heard that the fan on the original is really hot and hot in handheld mode, it's the same for the handheld and the pro itself. Is that true?
-----
TubaZef: The fan on the original is hot, but the fan on the pro is hot.
The fan on the original is hot, but the control sticks are hot.
It's the same for the joy of a joy con or game.
-----
The Dude: You're joking right?
-----
TheMadTitan: This is how I feel. The Wii U Pro Controller is hot.
I mean, I love the idea of a controller in a backpack or like, but this is a huge reason why Nintendo doesn't have a Pro Controller like they did with the Wii U. Why they haven't tried to do the same for the Wii U Pro Controller is beyond me.
-----
TheMadTitan: Well, I mean, it's not like they can do anything with it... but, it's understandable that they didn't take the time to add support for it.

~!~What are your favorite local multiplayer maps?

Dre Gring: I really love playing local multiplayer games in my favorite communities. I love playing with the community members and all the little idiosyncrasies they add to the game. But my favorite is easily the HotS and HotS2. I love the 1v1 mode in these games the way the different maps are designed to fit together and to work towards. I'm currently in a completely open area using a variety of fire/beach/acid gear and an arsenal of fire champions. It's a crazy feeling to see how well party composition and supported by the server work together.
I've been itching to play the new HotS game and I'm really excited to play some of the newer ones. I do dig the smaller planes though.
What are your faves?
-----

TreIII: The HotS. It's been my jam for ages, and I love it.
-----
MasterOfPastures: HotS2
-----
Dusktildawn48: The HotS.
-----

ShinUltron: I like HCS, so it's always been a part of my team. 
I'm also on my team of the three that made that Unreal Tournament run. Those guys are phenomenal.
-----
IceyD: HCS Every.
-----
Evolution of Metal: I never liked the previous HotS maps. I prefer the simplicity of the original maps to the open maps.
-----
CannonFodder52: I really like HotS2

~!~Halo MCC Insider Flight Listed For Pre-Order and Release Next Week

space_nut: Holy crap, I cannot wait for this. Also, to reiterate what has been said, this is coming from a flight.
-----
Strakt: Thats what they said in the comments in the other thread.
-----
space_nut: Damn, I wasn’t expecting that lol
-----
Aokiji: Hope they can get the landing sequence right.

~!~How's the new Doom coming out?

Vipu: I mean, i know many people are waiting for the Doom Eternal release and i prefered to wait. 
But they are not surprising. 
The most surprising thing was that we don't know if the new game is still coming in 2019 or if it's just to hit early 2020. 
Also, i didnt even realize that the new Doom was already confirmed for the Switch in August 2018. 
It looks like a great time for Switch owners in 2019 and could be the best game ever if it was Switch only.
-----
Lopez: It’s coming out in early 2019
-----
OrbitalBeard: It's an excellent game.
-----
ASilentProtagonist: It's the best Doom yet and far more than it started to be.
-----
MegaBeefBowl: I was expecting it to be revealed for Q1 2019.
Really happy about that, the port is great and it's awesome that they're adding to the Switch.
-----
KoolAid: I mean, the new Doom was announced for the year before the game officially came out.
-----
bananafactory: The new Doom is already is 1.5 millions so it's the best selling game damnedit
-----
dred: I think it's a great time to jump in. I have to admit that I didn't expect that.
-----
Aprikurt: I really had no idea Doom was a thing. I’m in day one for sure. I’m a big fan of Doom and love the series.
-----
Vic: It's a shame we haven't got a true Doom 2. I think the Switch is really strong in third person and they've shown nothing to actually introduce new Doom-like gameplay and the Switch is really suffering from the severe lack of third person action games. 
I'm in for a Doom 1 with Wolfenstein, Doom, Wolf 2 and Doom 3.

~!~RTTP: The Witcher 3 (PC)

JaeCryo: After being completely burned out on the PC after beating the last two major expansions, I decided to finally pick up The Witcher 3 for the time being in its Steam sale.
I've never played the main Witcher games before, so I wasn't completely sold on the whole "just get the expansions, they're not as essential as much of the other stuff"
And for reasons unknown to me, I didn't grab the DLC expansions.
So I've been playing for about an hour now and am having a blast.
My main issues were
1. I'm massively underwhelmed by all of the systems and quests. I've been playing on hard and with a controller mouse for 60 hours now, which is pretty annoying. Even with all of the above, I feel like I'm missing something that I wanted and can't get.
2. All of the NPCs react to what you're doing. It's just so jarring when you're playing on a PC or other high end PC, but it's still enjoyable, especially when you're cycling through the story quests.
3. The way they talk. I've been loving it's dialogues. It's very dynamic and interesting.
4. The way they're limited. I'm just navigating the town and trying to find and equipping more supplies to craft better armor.
5. I'm just used to it. The combat for these quests is just so dull and bland. I'm having fun with PoE, but I'm still having trouble with the swinging and hawking and trying to break stuff in the marketplace.
6. The graphics are okay. I've never seen anything that made me think there was an issue with the PC hardware to begin with.
7. The music is great. The music in particular for the first hour of this game is a joy. I'm not sure if it's placebo, but it's certainly a great track.
Overall, it's an incredibly memorable and memorable experience. I'm looking forward to the next expansion.
-----
Khanimus: I'm slowly warming up to this game. I've been waiting for this to hit the PC marketplace, and I'm not disappointed.
-----
TemplaerDude: I love this game. I love the atmosphere and the story. I love the characters, the world, and the music. 
I have
====================
~!~Lttp: Hollow Knight

lupianwolf: Just finished this game a few weeks ago and it was a blast.
The combat and design is simple yet effective. The puzzles are simple yet fun. The music is fantastic. The story is yet another notch above the rest of the game. I look forward to playing it again when it gets a modern fix.
Also, the best way to experience the game. It’s not a port of Bloodborne, but a new port of everything else.
-----
Robinson: Hollow Knight is one of the best games I've ever played. I still have about 10h after I beat it, but I'm on a roll of old school games.
Enjoy!
-----
Alberto Robert: I agree with this, I think it is one of the best games of this generation imo.
-----
Soul of Miyazaki: It's a great game.
-----
Kyoufu: I love this game so much. I've been meaning to get to it but I've had a few hiccups.
-----
Lichtsang: It's one of my favorite games of 2018, and I have to say that although it has a rough start, the world building and art design is just incredible.
-----
lame gag: It's a great game. It feels like you are playing a Metroid.
-----
Kazer: One of my fav games of the year.
-----
Vivi: Yes, i love it even more now, i got it on ps4, its the way it is because of the lack of the end-game stuff...
-----
Svart: I really like you, OP.

~!~[IGN] Battlefield 5's 30-hour play session: one hour of Fortnite, PUBG, and Gears 5 online play...

dex3108: link
-----
Falchion: I'll take 30 hours.
-----
SinkFla: Nice.
-----
JoDa: I doubt it will be that much of a time sink. I mean I'm not expecting it to be that much of a time, but still I'm looking forward to playing a bunch of online as I've been enjoying Battlefield this year.
-----
SJRB: Epic will be the ones to pay for local co-op.
-----
JoDa: I assume they have fortnite in the works as well?
-----
SinkFla: Yeah. The way I saw it, they are funding the whole rollout and they want to make it as easy as possible to play online. 
I guess if you have game pass you can get them for free?
-----
SinkFla: I did notice that I'm not the only one who thinks they're going to be launching Fortnite's Battle Pass.
-----
EvilChameleon: I'm not sure how they'll handle the servers for this game, but I'll probably end up paying for it if they pay for it.

~!~Best multiplayer game of 2018?

Dartastic: We've all been there. We've all gone back to arcades. We've gone to the toilet. We've gone to the livingroom. We've gone to the school. We've gone to the bowling alley. We've gone to the haunted building. We have been on an epic journey. And I think that's it. The experience has left a mark.
Here are my results. I'll try to list each of the games listed in the thread's specifics, but the formatting and colour scheme will not allow for the accuracy of the compiling.
Note: I have consolidated my results in excel (see below the images).
-----
NarohDethan: I played nine matches, so nine different times, so nine different people, so ten different people, and it was awesome.
-----
Dartastic: I haven't played it yet, but my brother and I are currently doing it with CoD. We played together at a friend's house and he has been playing the last several hours.
-----
Puggsly: It's been great. We played a bit of Halo 5 multiplayer with my brother and we beat it in one hour.
-----
Dartastic: Thank you, I'll give that a look.

~!~Anyone playing RE4: Mercenaries?

theofficefan99: I'm in the mood for a good modern horror game. Mercenaries seems like the sort of thing I can get into. I was thinking of picking it up on the PS Store just to try and not stick to the series for so long.
-----
Drain You: I have played RE4 and RE4: Mercenaries recently and it's a pretty good horror game, just not as scary as 4.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Played it a few years ago on my Vita.
-----
Theswweet: I played that game a lot back in the day.
-----
Theswweet: I've heard that. I absolutely loved it, and thought it was an underrated Vita-like game.
-----
MaverickHunterX: I have it on Vita.
-----
theofficefan99: Ah that's wonderful!
-----
MaverickHunterX: Nice, hopefully it’ll run well on the PS4.
-----
Drain You: It's a great game.
Hopefully we get a Remake soon.
-----
MaverickHunterX: Thank you! I really enjoyed it back in the day, even bought it on PS4 for my kid.

ZeoVGM: So uh, just started this game in 3 month. I'm really liking what I'm seeing so far. It's a really fun puzzle game.
They're giving away a brand new quest system in the new area, which is awesome.
If you're a Patreon, you get free games with the subscription.
They're giving away a brand new free game with the new area, which is awesome.

Gowans: Yep got my referral code and redeemed it, great!
I get a lot of free games with the sub but I’m mainly interested in the new quest system so the 6 month is a bit better
-----
ZeoVGM: Yeah. It is a bit flawed, but it is still the best in the series, it's excellent.
-----
ZeoVGM: They said if you sign up for a newsletter you get a free game with the subscription.
-----
Gowans: I got it for me and signed up earlier for a free game with the subscription, happy to see it working for me.
-----
ZeoVGM: Yep.
-----
Danzflor: I got my humble commission copy, it's a great little puzzler that has a little look to it. It's a 15$ add-on I think, but I got it for £5 with my discount tier.
Someone please find that one from me, I'd love to get it.

~!~NieR: Automata is a babe barebone game

Eylos: Im playing Nier Automata and man i dont get it. Its a game with many problems and its just like the other nier games in the genre. Problem is, you play it for the story and gameplay. Its a good game and i played it 7 times (yes 7 times actually. 7 times with the same group. 7 times without one single one. Bad opinions, bad opinions with a single one) and the ending is just so boring. You play the game only for the story and for the gameplay.
It's like the old days of the old Cozy Ridge Racer.
I don't understand the story at all, I was a little girl playing the game for the first time with my sister, and we played together for five to ten hours.
I want to finish the game, why do you say this? I say it because the other Nier games are the same thing and somehow I was a bit better off because of it.
Also, i played the game so much, and the combat was so good.
-----
Sesha: Because there's nothing like Automata in my opinion, but it's not that bad.
-----
Eylos: I mean your not a fan of rouges games and i was never a fan of rouges games, but man i love this game so much, it's so much fun.
-----
Vivi: The gameplay is great.
-----
BossAttack: It is, it's pretty much the same thing so it's just a little better.
-----
Silky: It's one of the few games I played with only like 5 characters, and I kinda lost interest after about an hour, but I love it so much.
The story is awful, it's bad, it's bad.
-----
Eylos: thanks, i will give it a try
-----
Miaus: I love it so much, I played it several times and each time I went I couldn't go back to it.
-----
Dannerz: I've been playing it for the story. It's a fun game but I only exhausted the first part of the game.
-----
Bjones: I thought it was a pretty good game. I don’t agree with you OP.

~!~I want to play the original BlazBlue, what are good original games?

mogster7777: I’m about to start BlazBlue on my PS4 Pro. I already played the original which is a bit old now. I remember it being really great with competitive back and forth gameplay but I don’t remember the original having anything that really beat it to the punch. I remember the level design being a bit jank but I remember the music being a bit of a step or down.
I have a ps4 pro and a 4k tv so I know it’s a different game but I’m wondering if I should really bother because the enhanced port is neat.
Is it just me or does it look like crap on ps4 pro?
I’m trying to remember the original before I started the remake and I got a bit lost.
-----
Astral: The original is a very good game. Definitely worth playing.
-----
TAH3145: I think you’ll have missed the part where they talk about the PS4 version being like the original.
When they remastered that game in a few years, it was so bad it made Sega cry.
-----
angelgrievous: I think you should play the original. It's a very good game.
Also the remaster is super cheap, you can play it for cheap as hell on psn with the cracked version
-----
Gunny T Highway: The original is a masterpiece. Play that if you haven't already.
-----
Kaz Mk II: The original is a masterpiece.
-----
mogster7777: I know it’s a different game but is it too far for it to not be worth your time?
-----
Dest: I remember being very interested when it was first announced. I didn’t think it looked good. I honestly thought it looked like shit.
But now I’m finally going to play it and I’m pretty hyped.
-----
Zukkoyaki: The original is a very good game, but the remake is a lot of stuff going on.
I don't think it's the best original game ever, but I do think it's worth playing.

mogster7777: I’m going to have to start the remake right now. Can’

~!~The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Switch is $79.99 on Target

Hero of Legend: As you can see, the SK is now up for pre-order for $79.99 USD.
I think Skyward Sword would've been better on this deal since it's priced at like $39.99. $79.99 USD or as we can get Skyward Sword for less than that (about $23.49 GBP).
It'd make a great Skypack deal at that price, given that it's basically a Skyline Deluxe.
-----
Seedy87: $19.79 is the Skyward Sword Skyline Gold standard edition, which is a great deal.
-----
Tribal_Cult: $19.79 is a bit too steep for me. I've already had my backlog lined up with the Wii and other 3DS titles so this is a nice bonus.
-----
Eolz: Skyward Sword doesn't even come with a digital download.
-----
Hero of Legend: I think it's still a bit to many for a Skyward Sword Deluxe Edition. Like we already knew the price was also Skyward Sword's, but still.
-----
Jahranimo: I mean why does Google play a Skyward Sword game for $60 when they don't even have a PC for that?
-----
Etrian Darkness: You're thinking of the Skyward Sword version for $19.99.
Also Skyward Sword is also on Game Pass month so this is a nice bonus.
-----
KarmaCow: $19.79...
I have to be honest. This is the kinda game I'm most interested in, but at this price, I don't even play it.
-----
Hero of Legend: I'm kind of hoping this is just a price drop for the Skyward Sword PC version. I would have grabbed it but at that price I might as well not even touch it.
-----
ShinUltramanJ: Skyward Sword is the best game of the bunch and I’ve yet to actually pay any attention to it.

~!~Sanzaru Games’ Director of Fighting Fantasy Leap says he’s a big fan of the genre

Dreamboum: So, I know fighting games are a genre that hasn’t been explored very much and it seems like a genre that hasn’t really been mentioned in a way that’s widely considered interesting, like Metal Gear Solid 2 or Dead Rising. I know SFIV was a huge success and then they’ve made a sequel to that, but then again SFV was huge as well.
So, I ask you, is there a chance that he might be right?
He’s enthusiastic about the genre, and he said that even in today’s competitive landscape, you can’t really compete with people level playing a fighting game.
What do you guys think?
-----
Error 52: I think he's right. Fighting games aren’t very interesting. But I mean, if you want to compete and are serious about your work, you can’t do that. You’re not going to be making your games as good as Smash.
-----
Lant_War: He's right. Fighting games are not interesting at all.
-----
Eolz: He's right, but I guess you can't compete if you don't put big money on the line.
-----
SageShinigami: He's right, they're not. They're deep and demanding.
-----
Seven Force: He's right, but it's a lot more complicated than just throwing money at a game and expecting it to be as good as it was at being a "pro" version.
-----
Dullahan: I know what he's speaking of, but you'd think with SF5 still being one of the best rated fighters out there, maybe it would.
-----
Vicious17: I honestly mean. Fighting game development is quite dull at this point. I feel a lot of the time, the main focus of work is actually content, and not much beyond that. I've already done a few changes and tweaks over the past year or so, and the majority of the time, I feel like I'm just doing the tutorial stuff, which can lead to a lot of frustration, because I didn't really know what I was getting into.

fiendcode: He's right, and the best way to

~!~Fire Emblem Heroes: Facing Gale in the Heartless Battle is No Missable Spoilers

Hieroph: I have a few questions I want to ask.
- How likely is the chances of Gale potentially being able to melee Link? I know that is somewhat hard to predict, but I would be fascinated to test this.
- When do you think the battle will be? Also, the color swapped Mythrites. For example, Mythrites have red, green, and yellow. The colors of the starters are the same as the colors of the starters, except Link is wearing green Mythrites. So I would expect like 3 weeks to 6 weeks.
- How many items will Link drop? I imagine one is required to melee, but I assume there are only a minimum of rare items. I don't know if a rare item can only replace one item, but I would assume that
Spoiler
- Will we see the final dungeon's final boss? It seems like the final boss is hard. I assume we will get a surprise boss? I don't think so, but I am not sure.
- But what about Triforce Bridesmaid, Warriors Princess, and Sword Knight Gael, all from Fire Emblem Heroes? There seems to be
Spoiler
- Will we see the final dungeon's final boss final boss? It seems like that, but I would assume it will be a boss hard to reach before the end of the game.
- I don't really know if a boss like that will appear in the final battle. I think we will find out in the final dungeon's final boss battle. I am not sure if that happened yet.
-----
ILikeFeet: it's hard to imagine a boss like that full of shit
-----
Grexeno: "It's hard to see"
"Let's go back to the present!"
"It's impossible to see!"
"It's impossible to even see!"
-----
IzzyRX: "It's impossible to even see."
"The Fire Emblems I've found are impossible to find."
-----
SpottieO: "It's impossible to be!!"
-----
Hieroph: I think you should use the 3D backgrounds if you want to get the most out of the game.
-----
BocoDragon: "It's impossible to even see".
Hilarious?

~!~LTTP - True Crimes: Summer Solstice

Tizoc: To keep it short, I'm going by True Crimes (rip) and Life is Strange: Before the Storm.
I've just finished Life is Strange (PSM), and I'm liking it a lot, at least so far.
It's short but pretty fun. It has some great character development and humor.
I'm also interested in how the story unfolds down the road, and how things will be with the other characters.
I'll say that the game is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fun and responsive, and I'm enjoying the banter a lot more than I have in years.
If you're more into adventure games, you should watch the movie The Ballad of Gay Tony. It's pretty good too.
I'm also interested in the locales though I'm not entirely sure how many there are.
Anyways, I'll be opening up my copy of Life is Strange: Before the Storm soon.
-----
MaitreWakou: I can't wait for you to play it, I love it so much.
-----
Tizoc: Haha yeah, that's a great point ^_^
I'm also interested in the story as is, I don't think I'll be buying anything after this.
-----
FluxWaveZ: It's a very weird case, being that it's the only adventure game that really matters. I'm a sucker for narrative adventure games, and LCTF has a pretty strong sense of adventure and mystery.
-----
CloseTalker: Glad you enjoyed it. Loved the movie, will check it out once I'm off work.
-----
MaitreWakou: Ahaha yeah, I forgot about that. Thanks!
-----
MrSaturn99: God, I loved Life is Strange, but I think I gotta wait to see how the story unfolds next time.
I was planning on playing it straight after BTS, but I'm just getting bored of it, and the story is just... off.
I don't know if I need to play it again, but I know I'll be picking it up at some point, and I like the charm and sense of adventure the movie left me with.
-----
MaitreWakou: I'll be waiting for reviews too, I'll buy anything for like 10 bucks

~!~Just started Warframe on the Switch! What's the experience like?

Theswweet: Hey all, I'm a major Warframe player, and just started on Warframe on the Switch. I'm loving the game- I know, but it just so happens that it's been on my wishlist for a long time.
I've been trying to capture as many Warframe Warzone events as I can, and at first I was a bit unh-chancing, but I just now got my first Warframe event.
I'm not a Warframe player by any means - I'm a PvE guy, prefer I play in PvP - but this is one of the most consistently great and fun modes. And the community aspect of the game seems amazing.
I've been playing Warframe for a few years, and I've been really impressed. The fact that there's a PvE mode is a bonus, though - that's not really something to whine about. The fact that the game's community is so active is just so awesome.
Just wanted to get Warframe Era's appreciating the fact that Warframe is still a big deal for me, and I wanted to ask what players think about the game.
-----
Mitsurugi: I feel you. I played it when it first came out and have put thousands of hours into it, but after some initial positive feedback it just doesn’t keep me coming back. 
I play it because the game is too grindy and too grindy in design. I hate games that incentivize grinding. I feel rewarded for finishing a challenge. I have a limit.
-----
Masterspeed: I think Warframe is the only game in the genre that I can really play a lot without getting a grindfest. It feels good to play, it's fun as hell and it's free.

~!~What is your favorite song in the soundtracks of video games?

SolVanderlyn: I love the music in the games in my games. I'm not a huge fan of the soundtracks of video games, but I really love the soundtrack of The Legend of Zelda.
I have a couple of songs in my game that I find really great:
Darkspines is a great soundtrack for Xenogears.
I really love the sound effects in Mafia 3.
-----

Funyarinpa: The only one that comes to mind is the music in Ocarina of Time.
-----
Eolz: I don't think it's even a thing in the game itself, but in the music in OOT and the post-game, there's a lot of really fun uses of the music.
-----

Twenty5Thousand: By far.
-----

TheBaldwin: Not about music, but about gameplay. 
The music in FF7 is just way, way more fun
-----
Svart: I love the tracks in Forza Horizon.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: I wish the music in the Kingdom Hearts games could be heard on the Junes music box the way they do in FMV.

Cranster: Well there is one more game announced for MS Store.

They're just gonna sell me some canned multiplayer shooters.

ASleepingMonkey: I’m not sure it’s a lock. I think it’s likely to be a Halo only game.

Gravity Insanity: I'd rather they just release them on PC. I'd rather buy them on the Switch.

~!~How could I, as an adult, afford a new ps4 without a memory card?

Socrates: My co-worker’s sons has a ps4 so we can’t go running in our house without having played God of War (sorry, we’re having a lot of fun with it. It’s a great game and it’s hard not to get him a game.
It’s a really expensive piece of hardware, so he wants a new PS4, but we can at least afford to do that. Is this something we can’t do?
Any ideas?
-----
Mazzle: Memory cards are expensive af.
-----
MtG: You can't afford $500 memory cards, right?
-----
Soulflarz: I'd say go for it but it's not easy.
All first party games are on sale for $60-80.
-----
Hippopuncher12: How can you afford a new thing and still not play the damn game? I'd say just sell that old ass console when you can just afford it for a few more months and then move on. And I don't think memory cards are worth much in the same way.
-----
ImperatorPat: Are you thinking of a pspro right? Or a xbone X?
-----
Soulflarz: oooohhhh no worries, I was just wondering what my best bet was with memory cards.
-----
JaeCryo: I'm wondering if I should wait for a PS5 to get a new memory card that will actually run at least 30fps. I don't really have a 4k TV or monitors, so that'd be an easy upgrade.

~!~PSA: You can save your games offline on any device, not just the Vita

Jawmuncher: I've made this thread for the better part of a year now. I've posted about it in multiple places, and now that it's gotten the attention of the Vita subreddit it's become the "old" place for folks to share and discuss their PSP games, but I've decided to make this thread specifically to point out that you can backup your PSN/XBL game saves to your PC for your convenient device.
I'll start with the obvious trade-offs, and say that. The PSN store does offer this. For anyone of even curiosity to try it for themselves, the Vita store gives you the option to backup the save to the cloud on your PC. You can choose to backup your saves to a USB drive, or to backup the saves to the cloud. But if you prefer to backup all your digital purchases, you can use the PSP store to backup your save files to the HDD. And if you want to back up your save locally, you can do it via the PSTV.
If you're interested in trying this out, I recommend starting a group that you create for this. If you have an Xbox One, the group you start with can save with the PSN store. You'll be able to access all your digital PS4 games, as well as all PS3 and Vita games. If you don't have an Xbox One, you can save your backups via the PS4 store. Your saves are visible on a Microsoft Store.
Now let's take a look at the differences between the two. In the store, you'll see that you can scan for game data (if it exists) and then backup that save to the cloud. In the store, the save files only contain the game data. In the store, you can see what store configurations the save file is in. In the store, you can see which stores the save file is in (assuming you already have a platinum Trophy or a Gold Trophy). In the store, you can see which game is the final piece of the Final Arcade Zone. And even if you don't have a PS4, you can see which PSP and Vita games are included in the final Arcade that will be available to you (if you already own the game).

~!~What do you think of Stadia's UI now that it's done?

harz-marz: I love Stadia and I hope they continue to add more games to the service. What I really want to know is when and how they updated their games library. 
I remember when Stadia launched a few years ago, they were touting all their upcoming games and when some announced a service to launch. I was really surprised to see them hyping up their services for the service and when we got to their FY3 results, they were incredibly positive about their services and games. 
They hyped it up for this year to be a 'Year of Stadia' and while I understand their frustration with games, I cannot shake the feeling that they are waiting for the right time to introduce a new service to break their console habits. 
Then they showed the results here, and it was already dead. They are currently hyping it up to 18 million and are announcing their new services for the year. 
Hopefully we see a service announcement soon. Here are some examples:
Xbox Game Pass - $99.99
PS Now - $9.99
Ps5 and Pc Ultimate Edition - $19.99
Switch - $14.99

ShinUltramanJ: I think it’s dead. They’ve been making so much progress with them that I can’t imagine they’ll ever stop.

Theorry: I meant in the E3 they showed it for 5 minutes. 
It was at the end of the show.

~!~Post Your Old Portals On PC

JaeCryo: I've been wanting to get a good picture of my old ports and ports from when I was a kid on PC. When the new year came in 2010 I finally decided to put my old ports in.
I set up my PC and the mouse for my controller.
I wanted to be sure I could be the best at everything I was so I set my MSI graphics card and I started playing badly at times. I was Super professional at times, but I was a Super slow guy.
I noticed I could play Doom on the PC, but I had never actually played it before. I was playing it on my old mouse hooked up to the PC and mouse for voices only.
My only experience was with the first time I used mouse was a game I was playing on Amiga. I was born in the 8th Century but never really played anything with a mouse at the time so I always had to use a mouse. After that I went to university and played a quite a bit of game using a mouse.
I was pretty excited when I was able to learn how to play Doom and was able to for sure beat the game on mouse and keyboard for the first time and it was very fun.
I added Doom to steam to make it easier to download the latest version of it. I also wanted the game to run better and I bought Doom eventually.
I also bought a PC at the same time I was growing up and it wasn't until I got a arcade Machine that I could play the game and I could beat it on mouse for the first time.
I started playing it on my PC and it was a blast and it got better when I got better and better at it.
I want to post my old ports and ports that were used to me on PC and showed what I could do on PC. P

TheDanger: Been replaying The Wonderful 101 from time to time on the Wii and it has aged like fine wine, really a great little handheld.
The game was a blast and very creative, very charming and very fast paced, the characters were charming, the boss fights were very entertaining, it was just absolute fun. 
I had a blast with it and the graphical style made up for it more than any other game in the series, the Wii version was so good, I played it again a few months ago and just now started it too.
What a great console and game.

They're still uploading the new screenshots now, for those that have emulated, just wanted to make sure.

~!~Who is most excited about for Fallout 76?

ToddBonzalez: I feel like no matter what, the next game will be something pretty special. Whether it's a sequel to 3, or an expansion to New Vegas, or even a brand new game that takes more cues from the first two, who knows. I'm really excited about 76 because I love Fallout, and I'm really excited about 76 because I want this franchise to continue existing in the interim.
But there's one game that is pretty much entirely dependent on a deal, an existing franchise.
A Fallout spinoff.
Think on it.
Expect more than an expansion to New Vegas.
Ideally it should be a standalone title, just like fallout 4/new Vegas was.

Certinfy: I’d rather have a completely new RPG from Bethesda rather than a remaster of 3.

~!~What do you want from Kingdom Hearts 3?

theofficefan99: I think it's pretty much all I want.
I don't want them to completely cancel it out, or to start over. I just want them to continue writing the series.
I've been playing a lot of Kingdom Hearts III since January. I recently started, and I love it. It's an extremely good ride.
I just wanna see the story with the character interactions before Kingdom Hearts 4.
And I don't wanna have to watch a movie again.
As for the question itself, I feel like it's kinda dumb that the series is dead. It was nice in 2015, but this year it's really poor. I feel like they should've continued the story of the first three, and made a spinoff.
What do you want from Kingdom Hearts 3?
-----
KZXcellent: Split the game into two pieces with a few new spin-offs.
Keep the main games in different places like the spinoff DDD, the Final Fantasy games.
Keep the smaller worlds like Tri Force, Unlabored, Coliseum, Coliseum 2, and Coliseum 3.
-----
WrenchNinja: A bigger focus on the smaller worlds. I think the Final Fantasy games are the best in the series for the lack of dungeons or side quests. They're the same thing Kingdom Hearts is, but with less focus on the big, ambitious story.
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: A bigger focus on the smaller worlds. I think the Final Fantasy games are the best in the series, but I'm not sure why they're the better games. FF is a series I love, but I haven't really invested in the series since Re:Coded.

Spoke to Phil this afternoon and it seems to be the same as it did before. I'm a 20/20 pay barrier now so I can't expect a steep change. 
Can you offer some insight as to why this is happening? Is it because of the new revenue model offered by the service?

~!~Plot-driven video games (like open world survival games, action games, etc)

Funyarinpa: This is my topic for the past few days. I love video games and I wanna hear about them.
I'm talking about plot driven video games.
I'm not talking about visual novels or other games with a linear story. I'm talking about games with a main character(s) who are basically main characters in a video game universe and have their own story.
I'm talking about games that take place within a world that is told from a plot point of some sort.
Let's start with open world survival games, then the likes of Nier Automata, Metal Gear Rising, Dying Light, FFXII, etc.
These games have a main character(s) and a main hub area that you can go to within the world. For example, in Nier Automata you travel in this big, huge futuristic arena, which has a bunch of secret shortcuts that you can use. It looks absolutely incredible and absolutely gorgeous.
However, when you play it, you're presented in a world consisting of several giant open worlds, with many different type of interactable objects and objects within them. The only thing that Nier Automata has that is completely different from most of these games is the fact that the hub areas are actually levels.
However, I'm talking about game systems and their interactivity.
Let's take for example The Last of Us.
All of the levels have this huge invincible walking sandworm which can kill all of Ellie. Ellie is very vulnerable to the Spartan, but the Spartan only has a limited amount of health left. The ability to heal is basically the only thing that matters in this game. One of the things they focus on is the interactivity of environment. The only reason why Ellie is not facing this way is because the controls for the game are set. The ledge you take the w

Recently I got Dragon Quest XI. It's pretty damn great. I can't explain why yet, but it made me sad. I have so much hype and hope for the future.
Now, the good news is that it is a true sequel of 3 and 5. So, I'm happy, and I know that it will be a wild ride.
I've just finished the first dungeon. I'm liking the idea of a detective one, and I want to go back and try to beat everything with the axe, but I'm not sure if I want that.
The game is really great.

~!~Lttp: Resident Evil Revelations

ManCityX: Hello everyone!
I’ve been playing Revelations for about 3 weeks now after a long hiatus. I think it’s my favorite game in the series (yes, I’m American).
It’s got some great atmosphere, a good pace, a nice art style and a really faithful adaptation of the original script.
The sense of horror and the way you work reflects on your ability to plan your way back to the same house. The way you have to time your flashlight, the quiet nature, the terror in taking the locket out of every body that may be its owner.
The way the different guns have corresponding magic to alter the outcome of a chapter. The way there are marked up sights that let you see where ammo is being used and also what the skill used to pull off tricks.
The way the fog rises and falls. The way you have a gun to plan your way back to a police station from above. The satisfaction of finding each body and getting the item you needed. The satisfaction of finally having some gun magic ablaze after years of dread.
And then the good stuff...
Spoiler
It’s got a pretty unique atmosphere, pretty unique enemies, good music, and a surprisingly good story.
I haven’t beaten it yet, but I’ll post my review soon.

Neptonic: Glad you enjoyed it op

ManCityX: The game is definitely worth it

Petruccis Biceps: I just started playing on ps4. Should I even bother with the campaign? I played RE 4 a few years ago on the 360. It was a fun ride.
-----
AdaWong: I was really excited for this game during the PS4 launch. But with the recent news about Resident Evil 2, I can’t help but feel disappointed about it. 
I’m playing on PS4 Pro and I’m having a hard time holding all the camera points off enemies in the game. It’s a shame, the game looks amazing.

~!~Recommendations for Strategy & Simulation games on PC

Norwegian_Imposter: I would play RTS games on PC
-----
Durante: I'd suggest Divinity: Original Sin.
You can play it on a Windows 10 setup with the minimum amount of mods installed.
-----
Coxy: Might be worth a shot, but I have it on PS4 & Xbox One, and am currently using one of the DLC mods to make it run better.
-----
Crayon: If you're more into graphics, RTS games are generally not for you. But if you really want a good story, story, etc. Action games are for open world/realtime goodness.
-----
Norwegian_Imposter: I have an extra mod to make the game run better then steam imo
-----
Crayon: I agree. I can't imagine it being a good game.
You can easily mod it to make it play your liking.
-----
Camel: I remember playing Into the Breach almost every year for the first time and I was amazed that it did well on PC.
-----
Norwegian_Imposter: Ah yeah I forgot about that. Would you recommend it?
-----
Camel: I've been eyeing mods for games on my console right now. I'd recommend playing on Windows 10 if you can disable mods in Windows 10 settings. While I don't recommend Windows 10 mods, they should work fine if you have an experience running games on low-power Windows PCs.

~!~The best side scrolling shooter on the planet

Demolition_Human: So I just watched this video and it got me thinking about this game and how really great it could be. I believe it was one of the first video games that made me hyped for a AAA game. It just got me thinking how all of a sudden the big games nowadays are pushing it and it might be the best shooter on the planet!
The combat is just so so so good and satisfying. The way you can charge and parry and the animations are perfect. The way you can charge and par, block, dodge and retreat and so forth and so forth and also offers a great variety of ways to play and combat scenarios. I believe the best game of this style of game is Bound. The game just made me think about how much I value good action games. I actually think Bound is one of the most underrated ones and I feel like the combat and level design makes it really underrated.
So I'm just curious what everyone else thinks about this game. What are your faves and so on. Anyway, here are some of my faves:
-----
Puffy: I remember the swimming sections being really cool.
-----
I Wanna Be The Guy: The gameplay and levels were the best on the PS1. I played this on the 360 and loved it. I remember the first time exploring a giant rock cave and just standing there watching the physics and environmental interactions. The game was so satisfying.
-----
-shadow-: I remember being so hyped for Bound when I first heard about it being a bit on the short end for me. Then I tried it out and fell in love with it, played it again when I got a chance, and got the Platinum.
-----
Aprikurt: I remember being completely underwhelmed with it. I remember the first areas being a lot more tense and the later areas not just felt less interesting but had a really frustrating lack of enemy variety. I wish I had the option to just ignore the enemies and just explore the levels. I love survival horror, so it's only fitting that I replay this type of game at some point.
-----
RagingAvatar: I loved it so much. I had always wanted to try it but I never got the chance. I don't even know what it is nowadays. I remember reading that it was a PS2 game, but I don't remember

~!~The best and worst uses of Splatoon's Starter Pokemon

ScOULaris: Splatoon 2 launched Oct. 18 and in less than a month we finally have a starter Pokemon. Eevee. It's one of the most powerful and effective Pokemon of its generation, but it's also a bit of an extreme example because the game's primary method of raising Pokemon is to attack with moves that only work with Eevee. And in order to get moves, you need a buddy that you can use to catch strong and rare Pokemon.
So let's take a look at the starter Pokemon of Splatoon 2's first outing. We've got Pikachu, Eevee, Ninetails, Lickititung, Ninetails, Staryu, andMagikarp, all of whom are basically knock offs. The Eevee is the main, unique Pokemon of the game, and the Ninetails are secondary. Ephra was the first, third, and recent Pokemon to be produced exclusively by Entei, which means that they are the ones who were the first to have a well-known reputation for legendary Pokemon in the first place.
So in this blog post, I want to celebrate the unique characteristics and unique uses of the starter Pokemon of Splatoon's first foray into the online realm. If you have any questions or comments on these posts, I'd love to hear them.
-----
Why would you do that?: Personally, I hate the fact that I have no idea what is the staple Pokemon of the game. I can't think of anything that stands out the way I want. I think starter Pokémon are just cool and all, but I don't know if I want anything to be more important than that.
-----
ScOULaris: Lol yeah, I feel the exact same way.
I usually go by the starter Pokemon.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I like the ones that come down to speed.
Starmoads. No idea why they're the way they are.
Magikarp. Plz.
-----
ScOULaris: Right. I just want to hear Yveltal's name.
-----
Why would you do that?: I don't know. I think it's because the first few hours of this game have been compressed in my mind. It's such a wide world we're stuck in.
-----
ScOULaris: Right. I've

~!~Are there any other games like Cosmic Star Heroine that can be played in handheld mode?

delete12345: I am talking about games that can be played in handheld mode.
Examples:
Octopath Traveler, which is also playable in table top mode.
Persona 5, which is also playable in table top mode and has some touchscreen options.
The Legend of Heroes: Advance series.
In my opinion, there is no other games that can be played in handheld mode.
Examples:
Kirby: if you count Super Mario RPG, Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy X, and Super Mario Odyssey, then you are talking about games that can be played in handheld mode.
-----
Bernard Coleslaw: Adding some kind of Funky mode is all I need.
-----
Joltik: The PC/Console ports of Final Fantasy XI and XIII are the only ones that can be played in handheld. Final Fantasy XV can be played in table top mode too.
-----
Revolsin: Megaman Battle Network 4
-----
Syril: I have to say the first party games of the gams that come to mind are Fire Emblem Heroes, Fire Emblem Heroes 2, and Fire Emblem Heroes 3.
-----
KtotheRoc: The only other handheld games I can recall that work are Animal Crossing, Super Mario World, and Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
-----

Yes, that's a handheld.

KtotheRoc: Yeah, the other ones are the ones I've played on a TV.

~!~Why are Sony patches still being applied to 360 games?

Araujo: From what i've read, Sony doesn't care about discs in 360 anymore, they just add a download code, the same as if they applied a free code to a physical copy of a game.
I'm not sure if they have a problem in general, but they don't apply patches to games anymore. When they launch a game it will be preloaded, it will be available to download just like any other game. 
The issue is, they are not paying for the program. At all. They're not paying for patches, they are making a pre-order bonus of some kind.
-----
icespide: because they're trying to be mature and mature.
-----
d9b: They don't care about discs, they just added a download code and they can't use it. So they're pay to use them.
-----
johndoe8865: They just added a download code. 
And they're testing it and backing up their saves as new.
-----
TKru_Vu: Because they don't care about discs.
-----
ClayModel: They don't care about discs.
-----
DirtyLarry: They have been doing this for a long time, and it makes a lot of sense for their future. They are paying to add backwards compatibility to their games on PS4. They are testing it and backing up their saves as new.
-----
JayBee: They are trying to be mature and not behind the curve by implementing patches and microtransactions into the game. 
I guess they're just using that time to improve the game, they would rather not have to wait years to get it right then back to patch it than worrying about patches if a game is wonky.
-----
RivalGT: They really don't care about discs. They just created a program that allows you to download PS4 games.
-----
ghostcrew: I don’t think they’ve ever used patches to test a patch system for backwards compatibility. It’s always something they need to improve and they don’t give a shit.

Nirolak: Yes, my understanding is that it's only been in development for a number of years, and they’re focused on Star Wars games now.
I’m wondering if this is something that they’d want to buy back into development or something they’d buy back in a heartbeat.
-----
vestan: I mean, I'm excited for them going back in.
-----
Fiel: SWTOR wasnt even made by SW team.
From day 1, every SWTOR thread they put after the announcement was about SW team.
For example, "The SkyEra consensus is here" 
No one wants it.
It's just a "we make the best games we can" type deal.

SgtAdamCDN: I don't think it will happen.

~!~Xbox One X owners, what would you want to see in the next XBox X?

Hawk269: I have been playing some more the new XBox games on PC since I got my Scorpio Edition. So far I am enjoying God of War, Forza Horizon 4 and Firewatch.
I am curious what Microsoft aims their next-gen hardware towards. I am a little bit concerned with the hardware grunt to build a proper mid-gen Xbox X console but I am wondering if it is something worth getting for.
I am also wondering if it is just a matter of time before they are building a proper Xbox hardware line. MS has been pretty quiet this gen with no announcements, and I heard that they have a different mindset with the last gen consoles.
I am also curious if game pass and XBO BC work well together and whatnot. I feel like there is a possibility that both Microsoft and Nintendo will be able to have a good line-up once again because of Xcloud, and that is the only way I am confident that we can have a good line-up for the next generation.
What Xbox hardware would you like to see for the first half of the generation?
-----
Flandy: Forza horizon 4 still coming out on XBL in 2020 if that is the case
-----
Hawk269: I can see Forza Motorsport 6 being released on Game Pass in late 2020. I am not sure about that other than racing games.
-----
Phantom Thief: One X sounds like a good one.

-----
ThisIsBlitz21: I want the FH3. 
It should have a full game and all the expansions.

This is a list of the best fighting games available on the Nintendo Switch, as of August 2018. The following are not my held to be the best PS4 or Xbox games. Star Fox: Assault
Fire Emblem: Three Houses
Fire Emblem Warriors
Hollow Knight
But sorry if this has to be a rant or quantic dream.

~!~Valve's Artifact Card Game is still in the works.

GenericBadGuy: So Artifact Card Game is still in the planning stages and we still have a few months left in until the Card Game Awards 2018-2019.
So, Valve's Card Game is still in the planning stages and they'll be ready to launch their own card game next year.
While it's not their best title yet, it's the first step in the evolution of a genre. Cards were once mostly a work of art created by game developers, but today it's making a crucial difference in card games.
In the past, there was only one kind of card: A card made of solid gold. Cards were expensive, usually required a lot of grinding, and required players to trade in and sell for gold.
However, with Valve’s newest card game, Artifact, everything has changed. Cards are now made of gold, and they require players to score certain stars to unlock a card. This keeps players engaged in the game and allows them to get gold faster than ever.
Players can now only field one of their own cards at a time. They’ll wait a few more attempts before starting a new run, which brings them back to a faster pace. Players can now only take one card at a time at a time.
This means cards now require either a lot of luck, or a lot of luck, to craft them. While they give you a fair amount of practice in your fights, they also give you a lot of practice in your dungeons, which means you have a lot more time to think, to grind, to experiment, to find better spells and weapons, and to find a good recipe for potions.
While they are the fastest-paced and most efficient card game out there these days, they still offer a lot of things in common, and none of them are as exciting as the things you have just now. They are still made by the same developers, and they still offer the same lot in terms of mechanics.
As a gamer, it's quite depressing how much the genre just keeps growing. There is still a small development team for a lot of things and a whole lot of investment that goes into a game design and balancing cycle. I hope that it can grow even larger, and Valve can learn some lessons from the genre. It's quite a shame about the state of the game now, because it's a genre that I think is
====================
~!~Agony: How do you deal with Copyright Infringement

Mikey Jr.: I'm thinking about how in the new God of War I made a specific area a specific section of the game. I wanna start a creative kind of thread to get people thinking about how this game is going to be something that will piss people off. I know it's not a traditional action adventure game, but I really think people are going to be upset that this game is going to be used as their game of the year 2019. I mean, it's not like it has much to do with the philosophy of the series. There's lots of magic to exorcism, spells to cast, clever puzzles to solve to insane degree, etc., It's just sort of a mishmash of all of those.
I guess I can apply this thread to game design.
I mean, I know there's plenty of design-critical games on the market, and I know they have a lot of problems, but I really want to understand if it's a major-budget game in the vein of Soulsborne or Final Fantasy. Because the first half of those games have some of the most boring, dull, and repetitive levels in any game.
It's not that I don't think the game's got neat level design. It's that I think this is kind of lame and out of place level design.
It's kind of like this on every platform.
-----
xxracerxx: I try to make sense of the game.
-----
Mikey Jr.: Just... ignore it.

Deleted member 8777: I try to understand it and if I have to use a stylus to convey the idea of scale or impact I'm losing everything.

~!~I'm thinking of playing UT2004 on the X1X, but I'm not sure how.

Dylan: Title says it all.
I've never played UT2004 on a console. I read that it was an average, but fun, and that there were sexual situations in the game, and that there were a lot of female characters. I also remember there being a lot of butt rock and sex and nudity. But I don't remember anything about that. What I remember is that I played it, and it was really really fun. What is the best way to go about playing this game? I am not sure what I'm expecting.
I am curious how other people have played the game, and if it's worth playing. A brief summary:
- Is the game good?
- Is the story good?
- Does the game end?
- Is the story good?
- Is the gameplay good?
-----
Puck Beaverton: I adore it. The characters and story are great.
-----
justiceiro: Yes
-----
Dylan: I've heard that the story is not very good, but if you enjoy the characters and story, it's definitely worth playing.
-----
Dylan: I don't know. It looks terrible, but I've heard that it's a good game and if you enjoy it, it's good.
I've heard the story is not very good, but if you enjoy it, it's good.
It sounds like there's a lot of pay off when it comes to the characters and story.
-----
justiceiro: I've heard that it's not much, but it's not bad, but it's not really good either. The characters are bad, but you can experience the rage and depression by playing this game.
-----
Dylan: I was referring to the fact that I have heard this game is rated 18+ on Metacritic. The character growth is bad. The game has a lot of payback. In addition to the list I'm also referring to the list of the sexual/bimidating characters.
As for the characters, if you play the game yourself, you should be able to avoid most of the sexualization first hand. The characters are fine, and the story is good. I've played with a friend who's into games. He told me that there's some "bad" characters in the game.

neon/drifter: I am in the process of cataloguing all the games I've bought via the Wii U Virtual Console and Mario Kart Wii U Online. I've found that a lot of my older 3DS library is hidden in the "New" section of the Nintendo Switch OS. I have a few titles that I just can't get past my heads (Bayonetta, Viewtiful Joe, Aikibo, Animal Crossing, etc).
The issue is that it's scary for me to browse the whole system when I'm in airplane or during shift. I can't browse my library without getting my Switch in contact with the phone system. Anybody else having this issue?
-----
Mediking: Try putting your main account on vacation.
-----
TubaZef: I have a lot of old games I want on my phone. I usually only use my Wii U and Switch Online to play those titles.
-----
neon: Thanks for the replies, I'll definitely check them out!
-----
Mediking: Congrats! I actually ordered a "Nintendo Switch OS" last year just to use my old phone. It was really cute and cute I feel like a wonky AI. I feel like I wasted the plastic around the eyes.
-----
KratosEnergyDrink: I personally don't have any of those games, but I'm not sure what your library is on the Switch OS.
The only one I can think of is Final Fantasy Brave Exvius. I don't think it's available on the system.
-----
Katsubento: I have a lot of older titles that I want to play for a new Nintendo Account.
-----
Kazooie5659: Back when the system launched, I used my two Nunchucks and I filled out the form about every single job I had, from my resume to my job Titles to the things that were in my backlog. I got all the things I could, and I played through the games I wanted to play. It was a lot of fun!
-----
Herb Alpert: I had a lot of games and I used the system alot.
-----
ReyVGM: I'm 99% certain I never bought those versions of those games.
-----

====================
~!~What is the best and newest walking simulator out right now?

SolVanderlyn: I've been playing the new ones, but I'm not sure what's the best and newest? 
I'm currently playing The Dishwasher simulator. It's really fun, and I've been very curious about what's out there for the genre. 
I love that the game world and terminals are still valid across platforms. 
I've read some good reviews, so I was wondering what the current and current independent/Triple-A/Alt-Gear/whatever on itch.io is.
-----

Solid: The new Metro 2033 and The Firefall open world sims are still free, despite being on Steam and Uplay
-----
LonestarZues: I've been playing Firefall on both PS4 and Vita. It has some of the most interesting and unique quests in the genre.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I'm in the same boat, but I don't know if it's worth it over the other two. Not sure what you would call it as a sim, but I think it's excellent and enjoyable.
-----
Svart: The newest Game of Thrones is the best thing ever made.
Tons of improvements in gameplay, and the best thing about them is they make PvP hell unlike anything else in the genre.
-----
Tohsaka: The latest Fallout shelter is still free and the newest Firefall looks pretty good too.
-----
Tohsaka: The newest The Field of View is still free. The latest Farpoint is still free, but the newest Firefall is just as good. I think Farpoint might end up being the best one too.
-----
Solid: I've heard the name Unravel, but that's a new game, and it's a free game, so I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for.
-----
Svart: Oh, right, this is what I was thinking.
-----

====================
~!~First time playing through World of Final Fantasy, and I'm not the only one. What do you think?

Jintor: I love this game. I've been a huge fan with it since it was announced. The art is good, the world is good, the music is good, the character design is good, the story is good, and so on and so forth. The art still gets me everytime that I go into the menu to start a level.
Aside from that, I love a lot of other 3rd party games. The closest I've been able to get to that is a port of FFIX with Radiant Historia and the DLC on Steam.
-----
WildWolfman: They updated the music throughout the game? I thought it was just some music that was in the game for the first few hours.
As mentioned above, also added in the ability to use internet via controller (I think). I always forget how to use that thing lol.
-----
Notaskwid: I definitely recommend trying out the free demo of FFX-2 for just a few hours.
-----
Noppie: I think the music was really good on the first few levels.
-----
Nooblet: I enjoyed it for about 7-8 hours. 
The music was kinda boring for the majority of it. The last boss had a pretty good battle but the last boss is the worst thing to happen to a game in general in terms of atmosphere and design.
I don't remember how long it was, but from what I've seen from the FFX-2 demo, it was probably 20 hours.
-----
Un B Recomendations: I thought it was really good. I'd probably give it a 8/10.
I really liked the music.
-----
purseowner: It was a really fun game.
-----
Chainshada: I agree, I had so much fun with it.
-----
Sailent: Been playing it for the last week or so and I think I agree with you. 
I don't remember if it was the UI and the music, but when I did a quick look at the level design I liked how they grouped enemies together and really added some layers of characterization and mystery to that world.
-----
Kolx: It's fun, but not as good as the classic game. I didn't like the plot
====================
~!~Paper Mario World: Superpaper Mario

chaobreaker: I know many fans of the original Paper Mario didn't like it but this is a really cool take on the series.
-----
Toxi: I like the idea of a Mario inspired by the classic Aladdin game. Writing it up with the characters looks like a stylization of Sierra's cartoons.
-----
Tizoc: I'm interested to see if they've trimmed back on the difficulty stuff.
-----
Platy: I really wish they would remove the challenge from scarlet to every player to make it a more level, more meaningful challenge.
Like for example, you can solve a challenge of 10 challenge points. The game will only give you 10 challenge weapons. You can't beat that. The game doesn't tell you the challenge of the game, it tells me what it all means.
-----
Dreamboum: I thought the game was absolutely fine at the start without it. It wasn't just a challenge but an experience.
-----
Kalor: I'm glad they changed the difficulty to a shame. It was a cool idea but I didn't like the way they decided to set up the game.
-----
The Spoony Hou: That's a great idea.
-----
chaobreaker: I think I prefer Paper Mario over the original. I feel like there were too many 'challenges' that were just there to make the game more difficult. I actually prefer to play through the first one more because I like the feel of the game, and the way the first game has a 'advantage' over the original is more clever.
-----
Platy: I think that it is just a challenge, and not a good or memorable if you consider that in Paper Mario everyone is there to be killed, you have to find the solution if you want to progress
-----

====================
~!~What's your favorite Fighting game punt?

Syril: The Playstation 2 and Nintendo 64 trilogy of games are often called the greatest of all-time—it has been said to offer the best of arcade basketball and baseball games with the best of block-style games.
But what about the PSone?
All I know is that the PSone is a pun on puns in a sports game, so that makes it even more unbeaten.
-----
Richter1887: I remember my first time playing a Pocky in 64. I was so happy.
-----

Aokiji: I’d like to know too!
-----

LukarWuff: Had the same question. Not sure if that’s what you’re asking, or if I’ll even know what you’ll say lol.
-----
Syril: I specifically said puns in fighting games, not games with a big focus on the gameplay.
-----

Aokiji: You mean a pun?
-----
lodger: Yes yes no puns
-----

====================
~!~I haven't played any game since the NES that I miss.

ULTROS!: So I've got the obvious answer: probably Pokémon Yellow. I don't think I've played a game for more than about an hour (I'm talking everything from Smash, to Pokemon Red/Blue to Smash Ultra), I've only really played it once or twice and that's it.
So what games have you played that you still remember enjoying?
-----
KDR_11k: Pokemon Red on Gameboy Advance and NES. Loved that game, but I didn't really get to play it until much later on.
-----
Phantom Thief: I played the Mega Man games a lot.
-----
Vesper: I played The Last Story the first time around, and then got distracted with Life Force from the beginning. 
I've never played a game like that, and I'm okay with that.
-----
jacks81x: I've played a lot of Mario and the like. I haven't played a game that I loved...
-----
Phil32: I've played a lot of Pokemon Games since...well, the NES. It was my first Pokemon game and I really liked it, and I still have my original DS copy of the game. 
Pokémon Red Red Version: I remember my brother playing the game and getting extremely depressed and angry at the fact that I'd randomly win a handful of the Pokémon Red Spirits and had to go and get Ultra Balls from the shops to evolve them (they were expensive!). I was upset because I wasn't doing too much and felt really stupid, but he played me slowly and complained about how bad the game was. Once he thought about it, he started playing it again and liked it but didn't get really interested.
-----
GKSilK: I've played Wario Land games a lot, played a couple of GB games, and played a few GB games since then.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I played the Mega Man games a couple of years ago. I liked them and the story, and the games are still pretty good. I don't think I've played a game with such strong story or worldbuilding.
-----
Pascal: I played a ton of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles when it came out. I liked the story, but I found it to be rather generic and bland. I'd like to give it another try if I
====================
~!~Do you think Nintendo will bother with a Switch pre-e3?

Meelow: I don't think it will come out in the first year, but they will definitely come out in 2019.
I might wait an extra month for the Switch or after the holidays.
-----

Cartridge Games: I doubt it’s a thing.
If it’s not too late to release it I might see why late.
Having a third party involved in something like this is better for the industry.
eShop sales are likely lower, but I’m not sure Nintendo is interested in wanting to make it risk taking.
-----
Cartridge Games: I don’t think so. I feel like it’s a bigger risk for Nintendo due to the smaller size of a storefront
-----
Scrawnton: I think Nintendo will release it this year. It feels like the holiday selling of the system is relatively slow, and if they release it early maybe a few months after launch. It wouldn’t surprise me if they’re planning to release it this year. 
I think Nintendo is more interested in getting to the consumer in on their games, not just Nintendo Online.
-----
critcharc: I'd wait for a price drop and if they do release 1,2,ear 1.2 GB for some reason I'm sure they'll drop it to $40, I'm sure it'll come back down to the $60 level.
-----
MattAces: I don't think Nintendo will bother with a portable console.
-----
Renna Hazel: If they have the free time they have releasing games I'd rather have a dedicated handheld console.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I doubt Nintendo will bother. I think they'll come out very late next year.
-----
OrbitalBeard: The first half of 2019 is really going to be a rough year for them. They've already shown off the Switch at E3 and have extensive gameplay footage for Super Mario Odyssey, but they're already showing their face as third parties are handling their major releases.
-----

====================
~!~What do you think of the Switch porting process when it comes to how much of a pain it is to play third party games on it?

delete12345: I was playing Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition today, and it reminded me that I had to download the game on two PS4s. And I thought about how much joy I actually had to download the game to play it on, and how much of a pain it would be to play it on.
Then I realized that when I used the JoyCon to play a game, the game didn't pause it for the second analog stick. So when I played a third party game, I had to use the Analog Stick to pause the game.
I was wondering what other people have had experience with this? Especially third party.
-----
Bomblord: I'm usually not the biggest fan of delt out pain. I mean I have learned to stop trying to port games to Switch and just double up my releases to double up my time spent on the platform.
-----
Fanny: I've been playing it on the Switch since release and have found it to be a fairly painless and comfortable solution. Sometimes the issues just fuck me up until the end of the release date, or I just have to accept that I won't be playing it until late into the game.
-----
BizzyBum: I don't use it to pause games, but something that I do, it just breaks my leg 99% of the time.
-----
chrisypoo: I don't know, I'm not a fan of this process. I've tried using it twice and it still hasn't fixed it. I don't have to worry about any possible game that could come out, I don't have to worry about some minor game I will never play. I've tried using Steam and the Switch Classic just feels like cheating and euji, which is why I didn't bother with the Switch version.
-----
Jaded Alyx: This is a thing that happens to me all the time. No idea why but I've been having trouble for some time now.
Also, if you're not going to touch the second analog stick, you can just use a hammer and you're good.
-----
Lichtsang: I think it's common for the second analog stick to break after the first. I'm sure if you have a large stick then maybe you've
====================
~!~Will we see a more diverse cast of superhero game characters?

Deleted member 11093: I'm more or less happy with Horizon. I love superhero movies, but I feel like there's a lot of potential there for more diverse superhero playable characters.
Will we finally see the Avengers Games? I imagine it'll be next spring.
-----
Cartridge Games: I thought it was super weird with Thor and the other characters being only skins.
Hope it’s not cancelled. Seems like it’s been done before
-----
SageShinigami: Oh god it was. That was my thought. I love the MCU and it makes this kind of ambiguity super lame, but it's a superhero movie. Give me that character, give me that comic book adaptation, give me that movie, give me that movie, and give me the games, baby!
-----
The perfect Dark: No, it's not.
-----
TheStebe: I read the OP and i dont know if it is true since the first time i read it OP and saw the house of revens being set in the city in the game.
But it also sounds like it will be set in Chicago.
-----
Lunar15: I don't know if this is a good start. It could also be a terrible idea. We already know Spider-Man will have a larger scale than other characters in the MCU, and we know they're working on the game specifically for the game.
-----
KrigareN-: Unlike the first game, I still feel like we won't get a diverse cast of superheroes. It seems extremely unlikely to do so with the MCU license being thrown to the wayside.
-----
Aramon: I read the OP and i am still very much happy with the game and I hope the game doesn't bomb.
-----

SantosStrife: My order shipped today, looking for something to play at the store.
Any suggestions?

-----
LuckyLinus: If you have a Wii U, you can play it with the Joy-Cons
-----
TheMadTitan: I don't think the games you order are specifically compatible with each other.
-----
LuckyLinus: I assume if you have a Wii U, you can also use them together for 3DS and Switch?

~!~Any tips for a new player on the PS4?

Vivi: I played some games for a while now and I have a PS4. I have a friends that came over from school and we played 3rd person. He was also a brawler. I had a lot of fun. He asked me how to win the round and I told him how to play.
He was really into the generalities. He was a sombra, but I also had a friend who did a challenge and he was like....
If I try to play a brawler, I have to take a controller and hold the flame button. I had a great time doing this and when I got the chance to play he was really friendly. I’m not sure if that’s a tip for new players or people with a controller. I’d like to know if it’s possible to play a brawler than to have a brawler.
-----
Mediking: Hitplay and character.
-----
Vivi: I don't know, I kind of kind of am in the minority but I tried this and it wasn't the brawler for me was it.
-----
Riversands: I was just thinking that maybe people are too familiar with a controller? I am just trying to find any tips
-----
Mediking: Yeah, I kinda do feel the same OP.
I mean, I have a friend that tried this. He told me he loved fighting and he was also really passionate about it and was looking to get better and I'm like
Spoiler
He said he'd like to practice more and I said I'd love to play a brawler. 
But I mean, I'm not a tbh. I'm not going to put points in the nail of my muth

====================
~!~Are people actually excited for Days Gone?

torre_avenue: I'm well aware of the cinematic and story elements of Days Gone, and I think the overall consensus is that it has a great chance to be a great game. I love the way the protagonists talk, the way they move, and of course the camera angles. The Paris setting and neon tone of the game fit with a love for neon everywhere feeling I can't get enough of.
I know people mostly seem to be excited about the gameplay, but I don't think that's the case at all. The previews haven't changed my opinion at all.
I'm not saying everyone needs get excited, but it's much more than that. I think people are just excited for a story with a cool open world, a world that can be as big as TLOU and more than just that. It also doesn't have to be as open as Days Gone, and the writing and acting is better.
Both games are clearly about people trying their best to figure out how to progress past their most frustrating experience.
How to properly play
I know this will be a bit of a no-brainer. You're not the protagonist of Days Gone, but you're also not going to get a lot of flack. I think the general consensus is that the game is going to be just as good as the previous games, and I feel like that's what people will still want to see if they buy the game.
This is something I've noticed too, and that's the reason why I think the playerbase is more excited about the game. I'm personally more excited about the story and world, but I can't help but be taken aback. Do they think it's going to be good? Bad? Aversion? A mixture of both?
-----
DeeDubs: Good.
-----
Sloane Ranger: I am too preoccupied with the MC to really soak up the open world ambiance, so I'm not super hyped, but I'm certainly engaged.
-----
Nirolak: I think people are more or less excited, especially if it's a narrative game with strong female leads.
I think people are more interested in the characters that are there and the world in general.
-----
Toumari: I'm fairly excited for the story, world and characters as well.
-----
Toriko: I am 100% excited

~!~Trying to buy a new soundbar.

MrH: I was interested in trying out the Sony XBLA headphone, but after listening to a few headphones that’s only $20 I’m just getting the soundbar I wanted.
I know that it’s awkward to buy a new soundbar, but I’m not sure if I should bother, especially for PC use as I can only have one system connected to the LAN.
So far I’ve found no reputable models online, all things. I’ve also tried out two wired ones. Both seemed dead on me.
Any recommendations?
-----

====================
~!~Will we see any NetEases again?

CormoranStrike: I'm not talking about the rushed releases like Infinity War, ME2 and ME3, but the ones that were pretty far out on release day. I've been thinking about how much I miss the days of launch day hype and now that's changed. It doesn't feel as fresh anymore to see a game with a massive focus on online play, and it doesn't feel as nostalgic or fresh anymore to see a big single player experience with big open worlds. 
I know some people argue for a VR FPS from Epic Games, but I think we can expect VR games to be more mainstream. I feel like the games we know and love on their storefronts are getting smaller by the day. There's still a ton of great single player games out there, and I feel like it's a shame that we're seeing so little of them. 
Should we be excited for new single player IPs, or will the trend of 'Halo/Spidey' IPs continue to dominate?
-----
Aokiji: I think you’d find it more obvious if you’re not, I can’t imagine why it’s taking them this long
-----
Skade: We still have games like Forza Horizon 4, Halo Wars 2, and Gears 5 that are way too multiplayer focused.
-----
Lampa: I would imagine it will take a few years before there's a big single player AAA game like Halo or Gears that just has legs. Obviously you could argue that it's not a big single player AAA game, but it's still something that should be considered big, if a developer can think of it, that's about it.
-----
CormoranStrike: How many people would play Halo Wars 2?
-----
GrizzNKev: I'm sure that there are some multiplayer games that have big multiplayer elements, but I can't think of anything that's designed to be as crazy or populated as Halo Wars 2. I think the answer is probably games in the vein of Viewtiful Joe and Super Monkey Ball, but with a focus on online play and not just singleplayer.
-----
Jaded Alyx: No.
-----
Buff Beefbroth: No.
-----
GrizzNKev: I don't know. I think that, if anything, this trend of seeing smaller

Deleted member 42221: Splatoon
The first Splatoon. It's the only one I've ever played. I have a Nintendo Switch and the first Switch I really have.
The first online shooter I ever had. I played at my friends house in all seriousness and relaxed, but I wanted to be competitive so I had a Wii, and the game was just fun. I even bought some DLC characters (Waluigi, Star Fox).
There was something about Splatoon that had always exciteated me with its childhood and it did.
-----
Waddle Dee: I love my brother, but he's pretty much never talked about anything competitive, and as a result I've never really seen it talked about much. I think the closest I got is in Borderlands 2 where he called me a n***** and asked me if I wanted to play some Smash. I think Smash is just okay if you're not playing with the others.
-----
Renna Hazel: My wife would always bring me some Street fighter and my younger brother would always ask if I wanted to play something with him. I'm usually all over that, but I just don't know if my younger brother would ever talk shit about me because I'm not like that.

====================
~!~I have a very long gaming jam

Peltz: I've been gaming since I was 9 years old, and have an insane amount of free time in the mornings, resulting in the short bursts I spend on games. I've been gaming basically since I got a PC, and it's really helped in terms of life satisfaction.
I've been playing video games all my life, and it's helped in the long run, but I find myself coming up with something new and original.
In recent years, I've been playing a lot of shooters, adventure games, and strategy titles. I've been thinking about making a full time job, but I'm also a gamer and have limited free time, so my free time is limited. I have a few free days a week, and I mostly play multiplayer games.
But there is something about sitting down and playing games that really grabs me. I think about sitting down and playing games for a while, and I'm missing out on doing that often. I believe I can count on one hand how many times I've watched a full-time gamer finish a game. I'm sad.
I'm not going to lie, I'm a little salty that I'm not enjoying that game as much as I thought I would. I don't know if that's been the case for me. Because of this, I just started Octopath Traveler. I'm enjoying it, but also have a few issues:
- The world of the game is focused around a particular region. You travel between different towns. There are different towns (myastip Wood Town, Silvertone, Grimmburg, and so many more) and characters who will help you, but the game is also focused on a very specific kind of adventure: the journey. You travel from one town to another, from one character to another, each town following you and making you its own town and village. It's quite addicting.
- The game has not yet added an easy mode. You can play the challenges and find loot between missions. They are not yet final, but they will be added next week. They are not perfect yet, but they will be better soon enough.
- The game is not yet set up to be in a state where it can be easy to jump into some career modes and find new ones. The game is not yet set up to be this kind of easily identified game.

~!~Final Fantasy VI - What Fans Need to Know

Phantom Thief: Just saw this by the way
Spoiler
Okay so yeah, as a long time Final Fantasy fan, I know what to expect. I’m not going to claim to know everything about the franchise. But I’m hoping to understand what fans are expecting and what to expect some of the things fans have questions about. I think a lot of the information I’m going to ask here will be answers to fans of the game, not hopes or hopes about the final game.
For fans of Final Fantasy VI, what are the main features? What is the story? What are the characters? What are the story structure? What else should Square do?

Release an Announcement
Post a tease for the Project Expansion
Post gifs of the announcement trailer (gifs are much better and are much more important to me)
What are the main features?
Well, as I said in the main intro video, the story.
The story of Final Fantasy VI is that the world is descending in a storm, as the name of the apocalypse implies. The protagonist, Ignis, is forced to unite with his friends Crono and Adol in order to find a purpose for the journey. The plot is basic and not very deep. He starts by going on a journey of many, many tens and gruas in order to find his own purpose. Unfortunately, the main character Adol sees this and starts to hate Squall and Kain, takes his leave, and ultimately dies. Squall and Kain are happy to see him back on the path and the rest of the party is presented with a new character, Ignis.
Adol is not great, but he is charming and despite his flaws, he is still a fun character. I think Squall and Kain will be the most spoiled characters I have encountered in a Final Fantasy game.

Phantom Thief: I’m guessing that’s what it sounds like, right?
-----
Byakura: Project expansion.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't think FF6 should have a Project Expansion.
I think they should just focus on a complete remake of the first game, and then move on to VII.

~!~What is 2019 looking like for a game dev?

Tahnit: I was just thinking about what a game dev group of like 2-3 people could realistically do. I dont know if it is 2019, but the question especially is for those indie devs that are not located in the US. 
I have been looking for more affordable AAA games to invest into my life.
I am in the market for a family looking to make their own business. 
I also have a very small group who needs 2-3 people to make their living.
I guess I just wanna say how fun it is to live in a world where there is more options for creating games.
-----
Slick Butter: Indie games tend to be a lot of expensive entertainment, they'll probably be just fine and look a lot more professional if done right.
I agree that the "AAA" ones are more for the less advanced tech-demanding crowd, but I think they're also highly imbalanced and don't really mesh with a large variety of settings or genres.
-----
TheMoon: The AAA market is not for those kinds of games - there is far more stuff that you wanna make.
-----
Tahnit: I was just thinking about this too, I was looking at my library and I was thinking how many of them were already made by small studios?

~!~What's Your Favourite Video Game Favourite Girl Character?

Kwigo: Hi all!
I'm playing Mario Tennis and, while the game is fun, I want to know what's your favourite Favourite video game character?
I'm referring to Mario and I'm looking for a female character that has that characterisation in the game.
I'd like to know what you all feel is better.
-----
Owlowiscious: she's a fawn in my face
-----
labpleb: Yes!
-----
Edible: She looks like she's a little brown in the demo. It's just the sprite and hair colour palette that makes it.
-----
Gevurztraminer: Her design is iconic and classy but the game is not for everyone so... no.
-----
Samaritan: Favourite: Luigi
Incredible classic, even more so since it's a Mario Tennis game. The actual design is quite distinctive though.
-----
Krejlooc: I second this
-----
NKnight7: She looks like she has a tuxedo.
-----
Gnorman: I prefer the Luigi one.
-----
Krejloocious: I don't know if it's better or worse than the Luigi one.

~!~Forza 7 Is Leaving Some Hardcore Chronologically?

Zhukov: I don't know if if this is news in a big way, but it's pretty clear. The Forza Motorsport 7 demo has markeded the first time the game has been strictly strictly physically playable, meaning that you can drive around in the world track as long as you don't run out of stuff to unlock.
I've been playing the game from a modified rig that simulates how long you can drive at, so it's pretty clear to me that this is going to be a literal factor in the next installment, with mandatory regulations for wear and performance reasons for the Forza Motorsport 7 demo to be strictly to room.
I haven't seen a whole lot about the game so far (there is a demo this week, of course, but don't get breaking news before E3 so please don't tweet me about things I know about until a month before E3), but the fact that it's leaving some hardcore gamers pretty big is absolutely fucking crazy.

~!~When a game got a horrible price

Muffin: A recent trend.
I think a lot of people are tired of and are willing to overlook a game getting a really decent price.
When you got a game that is at least $60 or less.
I think that's a trend that is really going to help drive the console sales early on.
I am not talking about the price of a game that is more than $60 or less.
I am talking about the price that a game is getting a lot on a sale.
Usually.
But this time, $40 or so (or so) is a great deal if I wanted to play a console or handheld RPG.
Just to say I agree with you.
Now the question is when the price drop started.
For example, a game that is $40 or less or a game that you would consider getting if you just wanted to play a bit of side quest or something.
I am talking about when a game was $60 or less.
$40 is a great price for a game that you would consider getting later if you just want to play a bit of side quest or something.
So what are some of your examples Era?
-----
Omar310: You're welcome
-----
Aokiji: I don’t know how but RDR2 is $80 when the PSN price is right next to that. 
For 20 I would buy.
-----
Pascal: I got Hollow Knight for $45 last week on the X. I would not even get another copy if I thought that the existence made me more likely to buy it.
-----
Jawmuncher: We have an OT for the thread.
-----
Muffin: Yep, we have a thread already.
-----
Frostman: I would buy it for 60 instead of $60. 
I don’t think it needs a price drop at all, mainly because it’s a 60 dollar game and I think it sells for 70-80 dollars.
-----
Silfer: I should buy Horizon Zero Dawn.
It’s one of the best games I’ve ever played and I think it’s only $20.

~!~Will it ever happen?

chronic_archaic: For the longest time, the Resident Evil franchise was treated as if it never happened. The series has always been a mystery to me, and makes it more irritating.
The series has always been more popular and I've always assumed it never will. The latest in particular, is the remake of 3. It's the series that's been remade.
But the announcement that Capcom would be remaking Resident Evil 5 made me think: maybe it's not happening? I just want to play RE6, and I really want to.
-----
Spring-Loaded: Yes, they will.
-----
Deleted member 51266: RE6 was announced in 2007.
It's not happening.
-----
Joshg27: Capcom hasn't made a new RE game since...1999?
-----
Flux: Resident Evil Remake will never happen. (And it's likely going to be another RE game)
-----
Deleted member 51266: It’s not happening.
-----
Bhonar: I'd rather they not do that right now. Just remake RE6
-----
Wraith: I hope not.
-----
Herb Alpert: Won't happen either. If they were not remaking RE6, they wouldn't be making RE7.
-----
CannonFodder52: They won't.

dimasok: I find myself agreeing with most of the poll options. I only disliked the last 2 entries (4 and 7, I think they did not live up to their potential and they are easy games to avoid) and I still feel strongly in to them, as I have done for decades in this forum. So what do you prefer?
-----
Chivalry: I like those guy games.
-----
Bman94: I always prefer the first one. The twist and turns are great.
-----
Jawmuncher: I like the first one a lot. I like the characters and theme of the first one.
-----
Bumhead: I like the one that was made. 
But I haven't played the second.
-----
Village: I liked the first game and thought it was much more fun, but not sure if I should go back to it
I really enjoyed the time I spent with it. It was like a really good pc game
-----
TheBaldwin: I liked the first one, but with the twist at the end.
And with how the cast of assassins began to use mindgames and artificial constraints to take out all the good guys, it all just fell apart
-----
DesmaX: I enjoyed the first one, but hated the setup.
The ending was a bit rushed, but I loved that twist

The Spoony Hou: That's a great name. I'll give it a shot.
-----
Mediking: I can't remember the last time I played one lol. But it was wayyyyy more fun than the first?
-----
Cartridge Games: I remember being pretty interested in this.
It’s on steam, crossplay, and most likely a bit pricey.
It’s sort of like SNES meets Zelda.
-----
TwinBahamut: It's been on Steam, Steam Dream, GoG, I think GoG is the best indie title of the bunch.
-----
Oreiller: I remember this from back in the day. It was the first game I remember getting on PS4.
-----
Aters: Is there a direct link to the game? I thought this was on PSN?
-----
TwinBahamut: The game is on Steam, PSN, Xbox Live Gold. If you can get it there, you can download the .exe and create a profile for it. It's not on Steam at the moment.

~!~What PS4 exclusives should I buy?

TheBaldwin: How many systems does Sony have going? 
What are some worthwhile 3rd party exclusive PS4 exclusives I should get day 1? 
What is the cut off for not getting a PS5? 
Will getting a PS5 help with backlog or help me get through 1st party games?
-----
Kolx: Nothing. Just buy the Pro.
-----
Kolx: I'd suggest you go with the X.
-----
TheBaldwin: I assume you already have the base systems up and is the best in the best way? 
I'm a bit worried that soon you'll be getting the Pro and X.
-----
Aters: You are missing out.
-----
Kolx: Yeah, buy the PS4.
-----
ChatonPai: The X is the best system when it comes to third party exclusives.
PS4 is a bit dated but it's still pretty good.
X comes with exclusives that can be played and enhanced with a single PS4.
It's a bit of a conundrum for me because I think I'd be better played with the X.
-----
Cess007: If you have no interest in Sony exclusives, the Pro is the best option, if you want something else to play then the PS5 is the best choice.
-----
TheBaldwin: Thats true. The pro is just a better version of the ps5. 
I also dont like the Slim. It's a very noticeable and ugly improvement if you really dig in to it and the game design.

~!~Resident Evil 2: Remake is not a remake

AVtechNICK: Well, I thought this was interesting:
Well, it's not a remake, it's a "remake".
The main reason I say this is because both Remake and Remake are closely tied to one another, so the remake is trying to show a new direction for the game and it's not actually a "new game" in the same sense.
I was thinking about this the other day, and it's a real shame, because it's one of my favorite Resident Evil games, and one of the best ones, period.
Remake is not a remake of the original game.
Remake is a reimagining of the original Resident Evil, for those that have played the original and liked it, a new game that takes place in the original timeline where Leon is haunted by Sherry and Chris is not you, but a new game that takes place in timeline RE2 Claire.
The reason it took so long to remake the original is because the remake was done by a team from the same team that made Resident Evil 1, 2 and 3.
Remake happens when the developer and studio that created the game are split up between two different places: Japan and North America.
The reason why the original Resi 2 didn't have a remake was because they wanted to show a new story and not a remake.
Resident Evil 2 is the first game in a long time to be remade by a Japanese studio (though the remake is still in development), and it'stheir first time in this format.
People here have played the original and haven't yet seen the game go to the Remake remake yet, because of the story and cutscenes being the same in the remake.
The reason why the original RE2 didn't have a remaster is because the original team from the original team that made the game split up to remake the game.
The reason why the Remake didn't get a Remake is because the original RE2 didn't have a great artstyle.
The reason why the Remake didn't get a Remake is because the Remake team didn't like the look of the game, because the game's very different from the Remake, but the same thing happened with the Remake RE2.
The reason why Remake didn't get a Remake is, it's a remake of the game that

Krejlooc: I was even more curious about this game than I was.

Krejlooc: I was just thinking about this game when I thought about how much Sega Ages Sonic Mania was missing in Japan. The game is in fact out in the US, but Sega Ages Alex Kidd in Miracle World was always planned as an import version of Sonic Mania released in 2012.
I've now decided that Sega Ages Alex Kidd in Miracle World will be the first game in the series to be released in the US (or the world) on March 26th, 2019.

Crazy Izanagi: So I’m trying to get through the story of Valkyria Chronicles 4.
So far I’m liking the gameplay but I’m just getting overwhelmed by the fast respawn rate.
I don’t understand the “you die every battle” mechanic.
Any advice?
-----
Omar310: There's only really one mechanic I can think of.
You can get thrown into a battle, get thrown to the next battle, and then die. I had this happen with the first time. I was just happy to have survived.
-----
CielTynave: Wait, the respawn mechanic is only available at the beginning of battles? 
I think it’s a turn-based game and it’s what I played on the 360. If you’re playing on PC, turn the system off entirely, and turn off all the other things.
-----
Omar310: Oh yeah, I totally forgot about that. I should have just thrown it at the hand of Miyazaki.
-----
CielTynave: Well, duh. I mean that as a death/continuation problem. Unless the game is great in that it just endures in the end.
-----
CielTynave: Oh, man. I forgot about that too. I just played it last Friday and it was easy to just get thrown into a battle and die. I had to respawn (I was in the middle of the screen and died) because I was so close to death, but I was too scared of dying.
-----
CielTynave: Yeah, it actually runs counter to the game flow. That was a pretty common issue with a lot of JRPGs at the time.
-----
Marlowe: Perfectly validating this post.
-----
CielTynave: I know I should have just assumed it was a turn-based game.
-----
Omar310: No, it’s not. You can actually beat the game after getting thrown.

VanCityGamer: This is a really fun question and is a great topic for the Pokemon fandom.
Personally I'm partial to Gen 3 but I'm also fond of Yellow, Alpha Sapphire, and Delta.
What do you all think is the favourite generation?
-----
Jahranimo: Black and White.
-----
PSqueak: Black and White are my favourite Pokemon games, but Alpha Sapphire and Delta are my least favourites.
-----
Gleethor: Black and White are my least favourite games, but Black and White is my least favourite.

pokéfan: I guess I'm not really the Pokemon people
-----
Lusamine: Alpha Sapphire.
-----
BoTalksGames: It’s a very hard choice between Alpha and Delta, but I like Black and White. I also like the idea of a Pokémon game.
I like the idea of keeping your starter in your team that way, but I was worried they would homogenizing it.
I like how you have a starter that can learn every Pokémon in the game and can just transfer them to the end of the game. And since you have a good amount of Pokemon, there was a good amount of time where you could transfer them back to your starter.
-----
Luigi87: I think gen 2 is the most popular, but I'm biased towards Black and White.
-----
Grapezard: I think the only generation I'm least fond of is the first gen of Pokemon. Pokemon evolved over time...but they're a relic from an era that passed many times. 1.5 years ago...and we're already used to Version 1 and 2.

Also, is it just the latest ramble and ramshy anime stuff? If it's different from the rest of the series, what do you think it should look like?
-----
WillySJ3: It's very old.

dietpepsi: It's a good series. Get Yakuza 3,4,5,6.

Ogawa-san: For sure. I've been meaning to play it, but don't know if I'll pull the trigger.

Every aspect of the game is built around the premise of the game - it's a colossal maze filled with secrets.
The combat is nothing short of tedious, requiring you to use the shitty and slow jittery super system, which is admittedly great for a JRPG, but still...
FFVII is the closest to Final Fantasy, but it requires a very deep understanding of the mechanics and the way the game works so FFVII is almost on the lowest of highs.
It's hard to choose between the two, imo, but FFVII is by far the best in the series by far.
-----
MegaSackman: FFVII is the most interesting one, only because the existence of four amazing sequels in the series made it such a big deal.
-----
HiroTSK5: FFVII is the worst one, imo.
-----
sir_crocodile: FFVII imo. I didn't get it because I didn't have the time to sink into the other three games but I did have the budget to play through VII first.
-----
Opa-Opa: FFVII.
-----
Etrian Darkness: FFVII.
That was my opinion.
-----
Cisce: I hate both games.
-----
Kromeo: They're both awful aswell
-----
Dreamboum: To me they're two different approaches, the first being a similar style of game to the other.
-----
werezompire: FFVII is the best. The second one is a far more epic journey spanning several decades of hardship and revolution.

~!~Favorite Switch game-

ZiggyPalffyLA: I’ve been getting back into games recently and I figured I’d be more interested in one I still have up.
So I’ve been playing a lot of Enter the Gungeon on Switch (I’m a backer) and have been really enjoying it.
I found myself wanting to get into the Gungeon as I love the genre, but I have a lot of other games in the genre that I’m just sort of instantly drawn to.
I’ve started with the original Mario & Luigi on NES, but I really love Super Mario Odyssey and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on Switch.
But then, I got to thinking about what I’d be playing in a Mario & Luigi: Bowsers Inside Adventure.
In the start of the game, as soon as you connect the dots, you get a message about a story relay mission coming your way.
This gives me a reason for wanting to play it in the first place.
So I picked up Super Mario Odyssey on Switch, and played that for a few hours.
I liked it quite a bit, and the actual story and world is really something I like.
Then I had to factor in the fact that I’ve never finished any of the other Mario & Luigi games.
So I started Super Mario Odyssey, and that game wasn’t exactly a great experience.
This is where the game shines. I’m not going to go into detail as I love the game, but I was just thrown into a world that was very bland.
I found it pretty sparse, barely filling out a world.
The characters seemed to be pretty bland.
There were a lot of really cool things going on, but I just found them to be a bore.
The main story seemed to be pretty boring.
I’m sure there are some really great and memorable characters.
The story had a lot of really awesome and fun twists and turns.
The side quests were pretty interesting.
The music was really fun.
I’m sure there were a lot of really great and creative things happening in the story.
The humor was really good.
The writing was mostly enjoyable and silly.
Overall, I think the game is really great and fun. I really like the characters and story, and the world and music was

~!~LTTP: Shadow Complex (Spoilers marked)

Svart: So, being on my radar as soon as I saw the recent Shadow Complex trailer, I thought it would be a good idea to jump in and give it a spin. Shadow Complex is a Super Meat Boy inspired game that aims to recreate the atmosphere of Super Meat Boy. Think 2D sidescroller platformers with platforming elements.
The trailer looks pretty interesting.
The Steam page has a trailer showcasing the game.

~!~Your favorite The Elder Scrolls: Stories of the Abyss?

Solar Puffin: I just beat The Elder Scrolls: Stories of the Abyss and yeah, its pretty good.
The art is pretty amazing, the world design is great, the quests are good, the villains are fun, the writing is ok.
But...the combat and magic are often so frustrating that I'm not even sure I can get into the combat system, it's just so much unwieldy.
The writing is not very good, the quests are far from simple, the villains are not really interesting in my view.
I like the combat system of Tamriel itself, it allows for experimentation and experimentation but it's still very vanilla.
I think Elder Scrolls: Stories of the Abyss is the best The Elder Scrolls IV, but if you don't care about that kind of exploration, then maybe go with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.
-----
CJCW?: I played The Witcher 3 a month or so after release and I had a great time with it.
I've never played ESIV, but I remember hearing that the DLC was pretty good. The big issue with it was the DLC's combat, but I managed to finish it in a single sitting. I wish the game had that DLC-type of content.
-----

theofficefan99: I didn't like the combat at all. I felt like I was fighting a dragon and the combat felt sluggish and unresponsive. I had no issues with it. I also had no issues with the visuals, at least on my PC.
-----
Syril: I found the game somewhat boring because it's a text adventure game.
-----
aiswyda: I was super tempted to buy the Xbox One version of Stories of the Abyss but it was on sale so I decided to wait for a sale. Didn't have too many issues with the combat or visuals, just a decent combat system.
-----
Aztechnology: I didn't like any of the Elder Scrolls games at all.
I remember looking at the first few quests and going "wait you're playing this?" and being taken out of the world at that point. The narrative just wasn't engaging and I didn't like it. I also hated the writing.
My 30-year old son is an inch more excited about playing the game than I am anymore.

~!~Smash Bros. Ultimate Controller Discussion

TheDanger: So we all know about the Smash controller, good press, etc. Are you going to be buying one, will it be compatible with Smash Bros. and will I be able to use a Pro Controller?
If not, what about this:
I know the GC controller is a thing, the SNES one is not, but what if I already have the GC one and is like, the best controller for Smash?
-----
Crayon: Yep! I just got a GC one yesterday too. 
I've been wanting to get used to a controller for fighters for some time, but I don't know if I should get one with pro or dual analog. 
Also, it's funny, cause I was asked at the other forum if I wanted any PS4 controllers. I said yes, but not sure if I ever get a good DualShock 4. It's been a while since I got one.
-----
TheDanger: well it's only been in stock for like a couple of weeks and I want to get it before it goes down, but since I don't have a 4K tv (doubt I will get one) it's almost certainly going to be limited to smash.
-----
Kuro: I bought my brother a PS4 controller last year. He loves it.
-----
TheDanger: oh yeah it's not usually a problem, but it's still annoying when you can't use the right stick for everything.
-----
Crayon: Not for Smash. I just want a good controller. I have a few.

Kuro: I know, I was in the same boat. I am.

~!~Why do people so much more entitled than I?

fracas: Edit: I'm not trying to shitpost or anything, I just want to know what the premise of this thread is so I can offer my own interpretation of the premise of the thread.
Recently I've had a little itch to play a certain Japanese game and I've tried to think of a reason why. I've tried to think of the following:
1. The appeal of a certain series (or genre)
2. The platforming and exploration demand a certain mentality. A game that is hard (Resident Evil 4) or a game that is very open (Final Fantasy) but is also very open (World of Warcraft). It's clear from experience that the devs have a lot going for them here. A game that appeals to me, but is not trying to appeal to the hardcore by making you play it a lot. A game that appeals to the casual, but is also very open-ended.
I've tried to find a few threads here and there that seem to cover this. One that seems to cover this is the ResetEra thread.
Now this thread is about games that appeal to the hardcore. So, if you want to post a game that doesn't appeal to you just do you.
The most recent example of this is Dragon Quest XI.
It's not that it is hard, it's that it's very open (World of Light). Its not open-ended at all. But it isn't hard, it isn't open-ended in terms of what you can do, but it is what you do.
The plot is very good and the way the game is structured quests. The way they are told is very long, but they are short (although not unmissable). The party setup is somewhat similar on the combat department (it's probably the most unique scenario in the entire game) but still the central theme is present and the story is really good.
I haven't played DQXI yet, but I will play it when it is out.
These games appeal to me because they appeal to the casual gamer. They appeal to me because they appeal to me.
Why do you think that?
-----
Viking Jesus: Because they appeal to me.
-----
Aigis: I believe that most of the people that are in it for the multiplayer are people that usually don’t care about

~!~What's your favorite story moment in the history of video games?

That was one of my favorites.

~!~The Verge: The Rise And Fall Of The Castlevania Wikia

Jawmuncher: Since the Castlevania Wikia was recently updated and has a thread for it, I thought i should link the most interesting news.
Valve’s Castlevania Wikia Just Had To Reminis Over Sony’s Castlevania Rankings
The Verge Article is at the end of the OP.
As previously mentioned, Konami has hit the reset button with the Castlevania Rankings. With that said, I’m not sure what to make of it. 
First off, I’d prefer to have the rankings updated regularly over time. Ranking after the reset button seems to be the logical next step. Which I’d argue is a detriment in the long run. Another good example is the ranking for the Castlevania Igavania games in Heroes of Might & Magic III was updated in 2015-2016 which ranked in 2014-2015. The ranking for Castlevania Rondo of Blood is in 2017-2018 which ranks lower than the Castlevania Rondo of NES games. 
The other thing I’d like to point out is that I’d argue that a ranking ranking based on the popularity of a game would only help the brand as a whole, rather than just highlighting a specific ranking.

~!~In the end, did you own a Switch? (as in, did you own a console before)

KingOfDyslexics: I've been in talks for the possibility of the Switch as some kind of legendary console for indies, and it was hard to decide on what platform to get it. Some had it before, some had it only later with the launch of the prodigal son. 
But I did own a PS4 before, bought a Wii before a PSN account required me to and then didnt, and now I got a Switch. 
I had a Vita since day one, but i bought it at launch, but the system has some issues atm, it's probably the best place to start ive ever been to play games.
So was it worth it to you? Did you own a Switch and had a PS4 and PC for when you got there?
-----
Kokonoe: I own a Switch and I haven't bought a game on my switch since.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Of course, I had the Vita but I've never played it myself, I'm sure I'll
-----
Jaded Alyx: The Vita. Just never really got used to it. 
But yeah, I own a Switch.
-----
KingOfDasters: No, I didn't. Hell, I used to and then didn't again.
-----
Derrick01: I had one before but it was weird to be stuck on the wall of the living room of my pull dry HD TV and not know what to do.
-----
Kapryov: I own a PS4 and a Wii U, and it's a double edged sword for me.
The Switch is my gaming machine, but I'm not sure what the heck I'm doing with the PS4.
I've been playing Hollow Knight and other indie games on Switch, so if I want to play that, I'll just use my Switch as my main console, and not touch my Switch that much. I've never touched my Switch on my birthday, but when I do play birthday stuff that day, I want to use the most I can.
It's not a great platform for indies, it's for me.

~!~The Last of Us Part II - PS4 Pro vs Xbox One X vs PS4 vs Xbox One vs Xbox

AAMARMO: So after watching a few videos I came to the conclusion that I might prefer the PS4 Pro version of the game as it has a higher res and ultrawide, but since the game is also ps4 and Xbox One X compatible I am wondering which version to buy and whether it is worth it?
Because I am also wondering since I have the same hardware with the same specs as the other users and i am interested in knowing what version is the best one to do it and what is the best one to get for the price? What I heard a lot about the PS4 Pro version of the game but I thought it was more optimized for PC and the performance boost on PS4 was noticeable. Also, since the game is also PC and Xbox One compatible and the performance is similar from the same locations to the other locations, I might as well go for the PS4 version.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It's not really a matter of which one you'll get but if you're gonna get it don't get the extra beef
-----
BigTnaples: It’s got a bit of a beefy upgrade. A 4K TV is going to be a pain to deal with but I think the Pro is just there so that’s worth it.
-----
The Last Wizard: I’d go with the Xbox One X. It’s also a much better version of the game than the pro version. I’ve only played the original but it was great.
-----
Puffy: OP, look up the game on the internet.
It's an upgrade.
-----
Jiraiya: Get that Xbox one X, there are tons of patches and it's by far the best version.
-----
Xiofire: The OG version has the most QoL improvements. But the Pro version is still the smoothest upgrade.
-----
ASarafanov: Why only one?

The Last Wizard: I’m like what you’re talking about. We’re talking PS4 and PC here.

~!~In addition to the amazing support Fortnite is getting, will Sony be fixing PS4 Pro support?

SilverX: Sony is in the thick of a gaming crisis and I think it's safe to say the PS4 Pro support is going to be a huge factor. PS4 Pro support was a huge deal for many, including me. I haven't upgraded my system in years and I feel like I'll have to return my system sooner or later. I have a launch Pro and have been pleased with it all this year, but I'm concerned that I won't have a great gaming machine for a very long time. I expect the next-gen Xbox to offer a pro upgrade as well. 
We haven't even scratched the surface on the features of the PS5. Do you think Sony is in a position to offer a pro upgrade or will they just stick with the base model and offer the Pro upgrade for free?
-----
Aokiji: I’d say it’s about time they did it. Especially with Gamers.
-----
Sleeping Lesson: I gave up on my PS4 after just one year. I'm not getting an upgraded PS4 at all in my current gen machine. I'm happy with my current PS4 and I think it's worth it.
-----
Dabanton: I can't see how they would ever fix the PS4Pro.
-----
Megatron: What if I wanted a Pro upgrade but didn't wanna pay the added costs as it is? Maybe they can do that but am I entitled to it if I already have a PS4?
-----
Cartridge Games: I don’t think it would be worth it for them to change it, but it would be worth it for Sony to fix what they’ve got going on PS4 Pro.
Sony doesn’t need to budge on PS4.
-----
Knight613: It's definitely worth it if you want to play games you'd want a 1080p screen or better framerate.
-----
Dalcop: Hmm, I kinda want to believe it, but I don't.
-----
SilverX: It's worth it, its a big part of why I prefer Sony over Microsoft. They have changed their ways pretty significantly and they will likely change (or cancel) the PS4 Pro if they go back to that path.

~!~Recommend me some good home console running games

Kazoku_: I've been playing a lot of Rocket League and Fortnite lately, so I thought I'd ask here.
I have no consoles hooked up and am only able to use one console at a time.
I have as following games:
All games
PC
PS4
XB
Switch
I have a PS4 Pro and a Switch Joycon as well.
I've only used the Switch Joycons for Rocket League and Fortnite.
What would be your recommendations on what to do in order to get the best possible experience out of the console?
Edit: Oops, thought I'd post slightly better suggestions:
- Rocket League
- Stardew Valley
- Splatoon 2
- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
- Mario Tennis Aces
- Axiom Verge
- Hollow Knight
- Splatoon 2

Ryuelli: Tetris 99
-----
Kazoku_: I've been playing on Switch, PS4 Pro, and Xbox One X. Only played a couple of games this week, but I'm leaning towards Stardew and Spelunky as my two most played games on the system. Spelunky is actually super addictive and I'm enjoying myself immensely. Anyway, I'm eager to grab a Switch soon.
-----
Puddington: I don't have a console and a console for that right now. I've heard great things about Stardew but I've never had the chance to play it properly.
I'll just go pick up RDR2 right now and play it on PC since I've never played it.
-----
maximumzero: I'm not sure what the best solution is honestly. I just have the feeling I should pick up Splatoon 2 and play at a higher level, but I don't wanna.
-----
Kazoku_: Stardew is one of my favourites. Unfortunately I have never played it and I never finished the last story mission, so I'm looking for something fast and easy to pick up and play since everything is pretty simple.
I haven't played Rocket League yet so I don't know how to do kart tricks, but I've heard it's amazing.
