~!~Where is No Man's Sky for January?

Phantom Thief: Having a thread on our monthly MUST BUILD SPOILERS for the game I feel like it should be discussed more thoroughly, especially as it is the best gaming-related thing I have ever read, and I was kind of hoping to share it with my current crop of friends and family, but after a long day on the forums, the thread received no replies whatsoever. 
So, here we are, two ridiculously good games, but nothing else quite like the first NMS, the sequel and the first real hint/beyond that we are going to get a full-on story involving space and time from space! But it's still January, where's the time? And the last time we ever heard any news about the sequel was months ago. 
So, where is this game? It's on my Steam wishlist, but I have no idea where to look for it on Steam, I'm not sure what's going on with marketing budget, dreams etc.....
Is it even possible to make a decent game out of the NMS? What can it be like?
-----
Mizeris Lutz Ether Lanai: I’d say go somewhere else. It’s a Japanese game so I don’t think it’s even really up for discussion.
-----
Phantom Thief: So, I’m assuming it’s a sequel to NMS?
-----
MazeHaze: The game is out and on Steam, there is a demo.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, I mean, if you want to wait a month for the sequel, you should.
-----
Carnby: I would buy it if you wait.
-----
Phantom Thief: I’d say yes, you’re completely screwed if you don’t support the original game and the sequel.
-----
SageShinigami: Just get through it. It's a disappointment.
-----
Phantom Thief: Well, I do remember it being announced. Please, I beg for a refund.
-----
Carnby: This is the first I have ever seen. I am not sure I wanna be the jerk that pays the bill, but I don't want to suffer not being able to play it.

~!~The most overrated thing about your country is your accent

TheSubsequentStrajack: What are people's opinions on the majority of the following things? I'm talking about the accents of our accents.
Examples:
- Honorable mentions: Just the best. Honorable mentions: Anything.
Examples:
- When I leave a game unfinished, I always go back to it's foundation and clean it up.
- When I lose.
- When I'm missing out.
- When I'm bad.
- When I'm a wreck.
- When I'm shit.
- Unspeakable things.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I’m pretty sure the majority of these things aren’t overblown.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I don't think it's overrated but I think the most overrated are the other characters
-----
Vicious17: I always just get excited for the overrated character. I do not like the voice acting, the sound mixing, the voice direction, or the acting.
-----
Peltz: I don’t like to be over rated.
-----
The Main Event: Is that an accent?
-----
Aigis: Its the european voice acting. I dont know how they would translate to an english accent but maybe it is just a bit better than French or a cajones voice.
-----
Einbroch: I think it's pretty well known that the majority of games have voice acting. I have no idea why there are so many european dubs though.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I have no idea what I'm talking about.
-----
Jawmuncher: It's pretty widespread as fuck. A lot of my friends do accents.

~!~What is your favorite mainline Final Fantasy game?

theofficefan99: I'm working my way through the 3rd and 4th generation of Final Fantasy games, so I'm in the mood for a RPG. I don't want to spend half an hour looking for Final Fantasy numbers on the page, other than this one
I like the way this game handles Organization, the ost part of the game is just telling the player to use all the party members in the right sequence, it doesn't feel like a chore or a waste, and the party composition is amazing.
I would also like to take a moment to appreciate the music here.
Spoiler
Sadly, the game doesn't have a musical score :(
I feel there has been a great deal of hype about this game, but it has been a few years since I played it so I don't know if it's been properly properly documented.
Anyways, about Final Fantasy.
Ontology is a JRPG that features a large cast of 8 to 12 people, but only 4 of them are actually the party members/protagonists. You play as a warrior who can change into a thief/mercenary/whatever, and as such are the most powerful characters in the game. Their skills are all powerful, as you can use them to protect you and send you down into the unknown, or even create a band of heroes who can save you by being the last member of your party together.
My issue with the game is that it is so incredibly linear. It's not really a game of pure story, but one of hunts, and only the most linear in terms of gameplay, with each town and city containing 4 to 8 characters (that is over a span of hundreds of hours). It's not a game where you'll be wandering between idling and fighting, picking up random mooks and getting shot by random people who can't follow you. It's a journey, and when you're done idling and walking around, your companions will appear and you'll be able to choose them and even influence them to change your path forward. The size of the party is only 2-4 characters, but every town you visit has 4-8 characters on it, and there are a lot of them, so there's no guilds or random characters. You don't really have to do much, just wander around until you find a specific place you find yourself.
I like the open world design

~!~Hype Thread of the Switch's First Month Launch

Phantom Thief: What are you thoughts on the launch of the Switch that intrigues you?
In my opinion, it’s a very good launch. Nintendo’s first in a while, and a very fun one.
First month of Nintendo Switch online is playable at 6PM, I believe, and the update will be 1AM pacific
The biggest selling point of the event is the first in which we’re treated with a trailer for a new game, the Mario Rabbids, a free pack of 5 weapons and an ability to ride stock in the wild
The biggest selling point of the event is the first stage, where we see Mario and Rabbids in the desert, gets to ride a RIDX ridden train, and there's a free ability to ride the stock in the wild
The biggest selling point of the event is the first stage, where Mario and Rabbids go on a race to win the lottery, Mario wins, then the Rabbids go on a race to lose as their pack is destroyed
And that’s it. It’s a fun, exciting, and entirely Nintendo-oriented launch.
-----
Atheerios: There was a thread already. 
I'm not sure what you mean by this.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yes, unfortunately. 
I've put a lot of time into the OT myself, but mostly because of the following points:
- The lack of a MP mode.
- The UI is very bare bones.
- The text boxes are ugly.
- The power management is bare bones.
I wouldn't mind if the port was a proper one, but it's obvious it's not.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: The community response is the first time I've ever seen disappointment from a port.
-----
Phantom Thief: I mean, no, it is not.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I want a port to the West where we’ll not need a second Switch in the desert.
-----
Phantom Thief: This is not surprising. I expect a great port.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I mean, it’s still a very hardcore Nintendo fanbase.
-----
Phantom Thief: I still think they're going to take it like the PS4 and XB
====================
~!~Are there any other examples of game mechanics being thoughtfully retooled to avoid unintentionally misinterpreting?

delete12345: Recently I remembered a thread on Steam Translations, where a user translated the Japanese version of Skyrim onto the PC language system.
As a game developer, what I realized was that the translation made quite a big impact on my experience playing that game.
I know this game had a rough start, and I had no idea how it was going, but I really liked the game.
I remember thinking to myself, "There must be something secretly translated into English because a few days ago I read about some clever twists in Dragon Quest XI."
So, I decided to look at the Steam Translations thread and saw that there were some games that were retooled to be more fully paletically speaking.
I chose TES: Skyrim as the game of that generation, and figured that it must be excellent if I just ported the translation over.
Since the Skyrim modding scene is often maligned, I decided to look at the other games in the same genre.
Dragon Quest XI was the only one I had played, and I had never thought of the game before.
That said, I was wondering if there were other games that were retooled to be closer to the original source material, such as games with questionable import values.
I'm not sure if the likelihood of this happening is predefined, but I found this interesting:
The author's name is Shigesato Ito, and he's worked in both Japanese and English.
The author's job involves translating multiple game genres, including JRPGs. He often makes bets about which game will be the best translated game for a long time before making a decision.
With the author, the primary alterations are not changes to the source material. Rather, they are changes to the source materials used for the translation.
For example, the author changes the "X" color to "Y".
The author changes the color to "X", which can be "y" and "y", which can color. Changing that to "X", which is... Gray.
The author changes the color to "X", which can be that color. Changing that to "X", which is... Gray.
So, if I'm going to red out a color, then I can red out the color to make it fit better in the cartridge. If

~!~Bloodborne Cut Content; Bloodborne: The Game

dex3108: Ok ive heard this title was very good and i want to get into it and it's great to see a new dev picking it up. I mean we know the game is going to have a lot of issues. We have seen the big cut content of old games and a lot of them in the last year or so.
So here we are. A couple weeks or weeks from now we are going to see more and more what Remake had with Bloodborne. We know it contains the dlc campaigns and we know it includes the new bosses and unique weapons. Now we are not talking about the remastered versions from here, here are the new bosses we are talking about after the game.
1) Leech Hunt
I am not a big fan of this type of gameplay. I am not going to lie, I was shocked when I saw that the Bat Pack requires you to hunt a Leech in order to progress in the game. Now I understand not every leech in the world is a leech and some are smarter hunters of the world. I understand there are others like Clem who hunt some of the more powerful bosses in the game, but most of them are also doers of food. I understand they made the Hunters a little bit more careful with food, but it is not a bad thing. I also understand that it is not a game for everyone since the Devs are not that great but they still do what they love/love and it is understandable to them.
2) Licker
As the name of the game indicates, it is a new Boss that can be a different Boss. The new Hunters being Bosses that added more to the game. There are new weapons and abilities to your Hunter. The new Hunters have more to do you can do. I like having a new Hunter.
3) Deacons
I understand that a big Piece of shit happens at some point between the gods and your insec

Dio: this thread will probably lead to some terrible shit

~!~Will we see more PSA games on the PS5?

Araujo: I am almost at the end of P5. I think what we have seen is that PS5 will have at least one of the big 4 games, with the rest being PS2 games (which will most likely be cross-gen).
There has been a lot of speculation that Sony will not have a cross-gen game on the PS5. With that being said, I think it's fair to say that Sony will simply use whatever technology they have at their disposal at the same time as Microsoft or Nintendo use their respective next gen consoles.
Now, I am not going to say that Sony will never have their own streaming service or anything, but I think it's highly likely that we will see more PS5 games on the PS5.
Sony will probably still use their current technology to get the most from their next gen consoles, they announced that they were keeping the PS4 tech behind the streaming service and we all assumed that PS5 would be using that tech to deliver some form of services that we never got.
But here is my prediction: we will see more PS5 games on the PS5.
Sony will likely use whatever technology they have at their disposal at the same time as Microsoft or Nintendo.
PS5 games will be exclusive to the PS5, but they will be multiplats as they use PS4 technology.
I think it is highly possible that Sony will use whatever the most powerful console in the market currently has, but for the first time in my prediction, we will use the PS5 hardware to deliver some form of cross-generation content that is exclusive to the PS4.
If Sony had the biggest bandwidth available to them, they would be able to deliver a content that is exclusive to the PS5.
I really think it will be possible for the next Xbox to be similar to the PS4 but with much higher quality content.
PS5 games will be exclusive to the PS5, but they will be able to be played across all consoles, they will be exclusive to the PS5 hardware and will be published by Sony.
This would make Sony the only major third party publisher to get cross-generation titles on the next Xbox.
In my opinion, it would be a huge software and services success story scenario.
The reason why it is highly unlikely that PS5 games will be exclusive to the PS4 hardware is simple

~!~Ace Combat 7 is the best Ace Combat since AC3.

Asbsand: Ace Combat Era has been talking about Forza 7 for a while but this whole time I've been wondering if this could be a top-tier game. For some reason, I mostly just think about how this looks and how cool it will look but I just feel like a lot of menial shit when it comes to the game. I know the game is not that hard but I still find it quite boring and the graphical style and all that have kind of tainted the game for me.
I think the whole thing is that the game is just about air combat and fucking jumps and the game is so much fun that I'm always amazed by what it can accomplish.
It's my first time hearing about this game and I'm very excited to play it.
Anyone else here feel like this?
-----
TheJackdog: i think it has it's hooks in you. the fact that the game is just about air combat and fucking jumps is really a hook for me.
-----
console lover: I thought it was really cool imo and it did a lot of cool things that AC3 didn't, not sure if it's my own shortcomings but I loved the "flight tree" and how there's always some sort of javelin between sounds before you can take an enemy down. I think it's a really cool mechanic and it's cool that the game is getting new interesting ways to do things like this but the execution is just not very good.
-----
Bond: I’m always excited for a game that more than likely does not have a PvP component
-----
Foffy: I was pretty excited for this game, but man, the execution was just horrid. I played a bunch of matches and couldn't even hit 50% and felt hampered by the weight of everything I was trying to hit.

GlamFM: I think its a solid game now.
I have it on PC but whenever I have the urge to go back to it is when I play online.

~!~Why isn’t it on the Switch eShop?

NarohDethan: Seeing this thread made me think about Switch eShop, even though I don’t like it.
Why isn’t this on the Switch eShop?
It’s on the Nintendo Switch Online service, like PSNow and other services.
The main reason is that they think users wouldn’t care or even want it, because they don’t have all the features or subscriptions.
If Nintendo wants to promote their online service, why aren’t they promoting it on Switch?
I’m not saying that Nintendo should drop the promotion, but I’m coming to the conclusion that Nintendo doesn’t care to push up the price.
Nintendo doesn’t want to promote the service on there.
-----
XSX: They don't want to.
-----
Jaded Alyx: They wouldn't want to.
-----
Phantom Thief: Because it's not on there, and it's not optimized for it.
-----
Phantom Thief: They don’t care to. They’re the ones who decide if it’s on or not, and they will do it if they feel like it.
-----
WonderLuigi: one of the reasons it's not on there is because Nintendo wants it. They will push it if they feel like it. They don't care to.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don’t think they’re going to push it on there.
-----
Camjo-Z: they're not going to. They even said that they will, if they feel like it. It's not on the Switch yet, and they don't care.
-----
Cartridge Games: Because they think all you need is a system that has online, good games, and a family plan.
As someone that had a good PC over the last 2-3 years, this is not a big difference.
-----
KtSlime: They could push it on the eshop, but they wouldn't want to do it on there either.

~!~For those who bought the PS4 Pro , will you take advantage of the enhanced graphics?

Neoxon: As seen on this video from last year, the PS4 Pro Enhanced graphicalAA mode increases sharpness and brightness of the game, giving it a nice graphical boost.
As you can see in the video above, the game is dropping to an 11/10 for this reason (incidentally, it's dropping to 23/20 on this video from last year, as well).
I'm pretty sure that in the end, the machine is going to be cheaper than what went above the $400 mark, but for those who bought the Pro, it's always nice to know that this improvement is noticeably (IMO) noticeable in action.
What about you? Did you notice this graphical enhancement?

hussien-11: I still think that it is pretty impressive that the resolution of one of the flagship consoles is so high.

Ahasverus: I don't know why but when I was playing God of War it was the first time I ever saw a 4K movie in theaters back to back.

i'm wondering if there are any games or platforms with good/better options for switch? games like mario odyssey, Mario kart, zelda, Donkey Konga, zelda deluxe, etc.
i know theres a ton of options for these games, but i don't know if any of these have good options right now.
so what are the best games on switch?
if any have good options, and i know i'm missing some, is there a game i should really play?

Nothing Loud: In terms of horror games, Resident Evil 7 is basically perfect.

otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

~!~Fortnite, the free-to-play mobile game, is now the #1 most played game in China


sibarraz: Fortnite is already the biggest game in school classrooms 
And I can already tell that people from schools are sleeping in with Fortnite today

docyoe: So what is the point of PUBG?
-----
Theorry: Game is free to play.
-----
enkaisu: lol Epic must be trying something now lmao
-----
Kenzodielocke: That's the point.
-----
chandoog: But PUBG is free to play?
-----
Theorry: Its free to play. Epic should have no problem releasing the game on the Epic launcher.
-----
docyoe: What I don't get though is why PUBG is not on Steam? Isn't the Fortnite launcher on PC and for mobile?

Richiek: Epic owes me a BR game.
Not Fortnite...

-----
Lant_War: I don't think it's possible to REALLY get good games on this game. I've played games like Yokai Watch and Paper Mario and as far as I've seen, those RPGs are super archaic in comparison so it's hard to get the most out of that series.
-----
Cess007: I got that fucking game for $10. Its worth it... I would have given any other $.
-----
Syril: I think all of them are excellent, but the ones I've played are just so, so, bland.
-----
ReyVGM: Red Dead Redemption 2.
-----
theofficefan99: I got that game for $10. Its not bad but I'm not a big fan of the whole open world stuff.
-----
The Almighty Tria: I don't think it's good, even if I like it. But I think it's fine.
-----
PogChamp: It's the only one. I don't even like it.

Eylos: i think the game is excellent, its very "artsy"

theofficefan99: Yeah, I don't like open world design at all. I'm not even sure I like "open world"...

~!~What do you think of The Witcher 3's first major update?

Couscous: The second season of The Witcher 3 is out and we have yet to see a huge gameplay update. With that in mind, what do you think of the game's first major update and what should it bring to the table besides possibly a new main quest line?
The Witcher 3: The Complete Witcher Story is coming out in 2019. The DLC is coming in 2020. The game has a lot of new content to add and I feel like we have another amazing expansion in the works.
What do you think?
-----
BRSxIgnition: I don't really enjoy the game, but if it wasn't for the DLC, I would be all over this.
-----
Kuro: They can make more DLC.
-----
Transistor: I'm all for additional content, but DLC is the only way I'm waiting for a sequel
-----
Couscous: Not necessarily. I still really liked the first Witcher and thought The Witcher 4 was a lot more of a polished game than the first two.
-----
Tonky: I don’t think it was a game changer. It was a significant update for the game and it was very noticeable on the first few months.
-----
Svart: I don't have any idea how it could have been so.
-----
GUSH: It was a nice surprise, but also a big disappointment. I was so excited for the game a few years ago, but never got around to playing it. I know it's very different now.
-----
BubbleButt64: It's probably my least favorite game of the year so far. I never got around to playing it but I watched a Let's Play last year and was honestly blown away.

~!~New Sony CEO: “[N]utured feedback is the best thing about PlayStation in the best way”

v_iHuGi: This is the first time WWS (the console manufacturer of video), has been discussing the idea of revising the policies of the recently acquired company.
-
Sony's business plan was to evolve and from day 1 be a leader in the gaming market for a long time.
-
Sony tried to evolve, VR didn't work for every game developer.
-
Nintendo had to also develop a new strategy going forward.
-
It sounds like Sony is not backing off of its position in the market for video game development and making strides in the VR space.
-
Making games has become a huge industry with the emergence of the VR. Sony wants to position it as it is the market leader, but it seems that they have to really solve the problems that they were discussing in the beginning.
-
I think that if Sony were to fully revamp the review embargo policy, the issue that would be presented would be raised: should reviewers hold off on giving their review scores?
-
"“I want to be able to review a game for several hours before I decide whether to review it for technical reasons or if I will review it for piracy."
-
"If you have a number of games that you need reviews for, I think there’s a real danger that you’ll give it to someone who has no idea how to review a game. It’s a real serious risk.
-
"The number of times I have seen someone give a game a review on the basis of piracy, based only on the fact that it hasn’t been made internally, is very high."
-
"The number of times I have seen a game that seemed to be in a rush of rushing to get out and then the review embargo lifted, was very worrying."
-
"The number of times I have seen a game with a major release day announcement being embargoed at the last minute by Sony for technical reasons, like that infamous glitch in the second half of the year that they had to pull back to the release day announcement queue because they had to pull back to the announcement queue just to talk about how amazing the game was at launch."
-
"The number of times my cousin asks me if it's coming out in October,

~!~Darksiders III: Original Sin Remastered announced for Switch

Silky: I mean it's a remaster of a game that got a HD port last year. But they didn't really do it this time. 
The game is finally coming out January 17th.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: Darksiders III is one of the best games in the '80s, continue supporting it and your support makes a big difference.
-----
lordlad: Ahh nice they finally announced it. It's a great game.
-----
BassForever: Great news and nice way to support the game!
-----
ASarafanov: Woah, this is exciting! I had forgotten about this. I remember playing the first on PC and enjoyed it quite a bit.
-----
ScreamingMadden: Nice! I’d love to finally double dip for this, I’m loving the support they’ve shown!
-----
Kurtike: They need to have this game has a budget of $60. 
I'm guessing this will have bug fixes and post-launch content. 
I'd buy this if it had post-launch content at that point in the game.
-----
ASarafanov: darksiders 3 is one of my all time favorite games, I'm glad someone is supporting it now.
-----
Shadow: I’ve wanted this forever. Played it on PC, and loved it on my launch PS3. 
I’m glad it’s getting the port treatment.

~!~I can't play multiplayer games with my kids

Tekku: I just turned on my 6-year-old's television in our shared room and he started watching me play Fortnite on TV. I was like, this is even worse than Minecraft. He's like 8, and he can't even pause or anything. I turned it off, but he continued to watch me play, and he continued to tell me about the game, so I turned that on.
It really hit me; I didn't want to be watching someone's kid playing a game on a TV. It really hit me harder. I was upset but I felt like I had better things to do with it than playing a game with a kid. It's really sad that I can't play multiplayer game with my kid because I can't play with my wife because she has this issue.
She's also pretty smart, but I feel like I should let the kid do whatever he wants and maybe dress him up in a certain way. She's much more creative than me and can do anything I want (I'm not that interested in dressing and dance).
I'm really sorry for your experience TKS, I hope you understand that I am not and has been a good parent.
-----
Jayson's Rage: I'm sorry but you sure that Fortnite with all those kids can be a good game for your kid?
It's actually better than Minecraft in every way.
-----
Xiaomi: It's a really bad multiplayer experience for your kid. I don't think it's bad enough to be fun, but if you can't play with your wife, it's not worth it. I think there's a lot of games like that out there that aren't designed to be played with kids. They don't need a parent to play with their kid.
-----
Cybersai: I agree, you should just turn off and turn it back on when the kids are asleep.
-----
Tekku: Yeah, that's exactly what I did and my kids (10-14) watched me and each other when I was doing the same thing. My wife and I had a similar experience so it's not like I wasn't thinking about it. We had a game called "weird" that played multiplayer with a sleeping kid and it was pretty fun, we thought it just wasn't for us.

~!~I've finally been through Hellblade. Should I try it on PS4?

chronic_archaic: So I've been trying a bit of Hellblade lately, what a time that was. I love the game and I've just picked up a [basically] new] console in March.
I have a 4k 65" PS4 Pro and a 1080p G-Sync monitor.
I've tried it on PS4 and a few other games on PC.
I was afraid of the game, but now I don't mind. I just want to play with the PS4 version, and man, the art style is really striking.
I've also heard the combat is really engaging and different.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Well the combat isn't really at that's a secret, just look up some gifs on youtube and you'll get it
-----
Carnby: If you want to play it, get it on the PS4 Pro. It's not a demanding game that you're going to get by beating it, it's a good experience.
-----
TheRaidenPT: The combat is certainly different from your other games. It's not a demanding game. 
That said, I would recommend just playing it and you will have great fun with it.
-----
RashBandicoot: I've completed it on PC and it’s a blast. It’s not just the combat. It takes it to a nice place.
-----
PopsMaellard: Yup. It’s worth it.
-----
Eikemo: Yeah the combat is more so different than you think. However as a game it's very well made, plays well and looks good. If you want to play it, and you like the art style and so on, the Ps4 version is a pretty good choice.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I like it for the gameplay but it's not that remarkable especially the combat.
-----
grang: The combat is great! I'd highly recommend it.
-----
delete12345: I can't tell if I'm playing it on PC, or my PS4.

~!~I'm having a blast with Kingdom Hearts 3 (LTTP)

The Last One: I've been playing KH3 a lot recently but it's been a lot of time since I played through it. I've finished DDD,Re:Chain of Memories and just now at the end of KH2. I'm actually really enjoying myself. I love Final Fantasy, I love the world of KH, I even like the music. But I'm really wanting to start playing Kingdom Hearts again. I really want to play 1.5, BBS,DDD,Re:Chain of Memories and the rest for the KH3.
However, I've recently been having a bad night...
1. I noticed that Kingdom Hearts 3 is 30% off on PSN at $39.99, which is pretty ridiculous considering its a preorder title.
2. I notice a small black screen when randomly opening files and I open them again. I get a notification about the item I'm looking at instead of the title says "Buy 1X" and now it's gone.
3. When I look at my game library it's like I'm in a game of life. I don't see a button for XBOX and I don't see a button for XBOX LIVE.
4. When I go to checkout it says I don't own this right.
5. When I try to use the same name I get a mail with a full resolution of what I wanted to buy.
6. When I try to use the name I get a "thank you" email.
7. When I try to buy something I get a "sorry" or an anorak
-----
KZXcellent: I'd say just go for it. I have a lot of games I would like to play and you can just drop in from across the world with 1-4.
-----
The Last One: Thanks for the tip!
I highly recommend you to do the Y = buy test here.
-----
Aters: When you buy something, you can just go buy it from a store.
-----
The Last One: It's not a refund, it's a buy test.

Chaserjoey: I have to say that I'm really enjoying the game, I just wish the game was better and less drab and brown and having a full resolution instead of a blurry mess.

Some (great) gifs

It’s obviously a review to support the development of BotW, but it’s not an actual review.
I think it’s opencritic? I don’t think it’s one that’s opencritic at hand
-----
Kainé: Opencritic?

Hamster Plugin: This is a confirmation that EA are going to make some changes to the Verification system and it will be interesting to see what you guys say. The next step up their transaction processing is to remove any transparency requirements for transparency. They did this with Assassin's Creed II Remastered as well, so it is possible that one could be neutral if they remove the other.
-----
Mikey Jr.: I don't think I'll like it.
The other two are good changes, yeah, but it's still a step in the right direction. Maybe one day they'll come up with a better system than this.
-----
Starlatine: They haven't said anything about the change in the OP. I am sure they will.
I really hope they at least remove the transparency requirement and say "we will work with you guys when it comes to fixing this"

dex3108: For me this looks like a test for the Crew 2 but they are working on it.
-----
Lant_War: Hmm, I can't imagine this will be a big deal for the game. Maybe it'll be big enough to be a huge success?
-----
Fury451: The Crew 2 is a big deal for me, so I'm really excited about this. I think it's perfect for me personally.

~!~At what point does hardware fail?

whiskas_fanatic: Thread title.
Despite the fact that I have some interest in new experiences, I am cautious about the level of time I have to spend dev restarting my PC.
Now, I am on the verge of closing the factory, because after some minutes I will not allow my CPU to run the games.
So, I have to do some testing before I can trust it, so I just want to know:
Is the problem with my mid-gen GPU?
Is it worth investing in an AMD GPU to play Doom and Wolfenstein (assuming I manage to get them to run well)?
Does the hardware fail me?
This is a very important question, I guess.
-----
AcidCat: I've been torn between the RTX 2080 and the 2080ti. I've played Wolfenstein 2 and while it's the better graphics card, it's not worth it in the short term.

~!~Spyro Reignited Trilogy discussion (Spoiler warning)

Jawmuncher: Since posting this thread seems to be moving it swiftly threads and in an editor I figured I should bring it to myself.
So, there are still a lot of things we do not want to see discussed with spoilers in this thread.
Again, we all want to discuss the possibility of Activision, or another publisher, including the one we have just posted.
So, let's get this out of the way:
And the discussion on Spyro has been fantastic fun. I've been enjoying it at times, and on the whole, it's a decent remake.
So, without further ado, let's get the bare minimum:
Would you like to see this discussion brought back to it's proper due, perhaps, a discussion about the viability of remakes? (Especially Crash and Spyro, with CTR and CTR's new up-its-own-shelf-game needing to be a proper remake or sequel for Activision.)
Would you rather see the remake brought back in this hypothetical middle ground?
Would you rather see a remake brought back in a more recent era?
Would you rather see CTR & Diddy Kong's tale unveiled at the very end of the game?
I'm not talking about the game itself being shifted into a remake or sequel like the previous one, but rather what the current situation presents.
Does this scenario warrant a hard reboot / remake?
Yes: This scenario is highly doubtful.
But if Activision does remaster the original trilogy, do you think they'd be willing to do another N64 Classic or remaster?
Would you rather see the original Trilogy remade, or straight up a CTR remake?
Anyone agrees?
-----
efyu_lemonardo: I don't think so.
-----

Denman: CTR was remade, so I hope it's both.
-----
DrakenAstro: I would love a remake, but I'm not sure if I would want it at all
-----
TheMoon: We already have this thread?
-----
King of Dreamland: Better be prepared for the inevitable reactions.

Raptor: I don't think there is a need for another remake.

Raptor: But what if the remakes happen in the form of Tricky:Reignited?

Derrick01: I'm guessing all the choices in the poll above are available to you.
-----
TheBaldwin: Cant go wrong with the bayonetta games, the list is small enough that i can safely say that most people who play them have played octopath.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: Probably no choices but the rest are fantastic. 
Octopath is the best and most charming game in the franchise and i love it.

RochHoch: Octopath is absolutely brilliant.
The rest of the choices, like the ones in the OP, are quite good.

~!~Best ways to express disappointment

LifeLine: Suplex is one of my favorite games. I still have a bunch of my SNES games and when it came out on the N64, it had a special version. I was trying to sell my SNES and wanted to buy the special version of the N64 (I also purchased the HD remaster) but I just can’t.
It’s not just what you love about it (the game has this particular take on language) but what you just love about it in general. For example, it’s the way it looks visually. It’s a game that uses the SNES’s colors to its advantage. It’s a game that uses its backgrounds to the best of my ability.
What do you guys think?
-----
Neiteio: I think it's the fact that you can flip between the game's original cries versus the broken versions, and that the screen is often a bit more obscured than the one on the original.
-----
PhazonBlonde: It is the fact that the sound effects from that demo are superior to the movie's.
-----
sir_crocodile: the review/review thread on metacritic, for example, has more than 80 reviews, and the review on metacritic has more than 80 reviews
when you factor in all the other threads rather than just this one, there is like 50 reactions.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I can't say I like the look of the company, the game looks terrible. I have the original as a pre-PS1 console so I'm sure they just aren't for me.

Dreamboum: I didn't even know it was a thing. I was so naive.

====================
~!~Selection of Nintendo's most interesting games

Busaiku: Not sure how many games here are actually 'interesting', but I think that it's fair to call Nintendo's games the most interesting, if you include the most obscure games.
I'll start it off with the list:
Fire Emblem: Three Houses
Fire Emblem: Three Houses had a pretty successful anime adaptation (not the best one, but still good) but it didn't really go as planned. More interesting than Fire Emblem is the direction of the series, which is a mix of JRPG, action game, survival game and hack n slash.
I can't think of too many other games from Nintendo in the list (yet), so feel free to elaborate.
My top 5:
1. The Last of Us
2. The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
3. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
4. The World Ends with You
5. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening
6. The World Ends with You
7. The Wonderful 101
8. The Mario Galaxy 2: Episode Abril
9. The Wind Waker
10. Metroid Prime: Hunters' Den
Honorable Mentions:
1. The Legend of Zelda: OOT
2. The Wonderful 101
3. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
4. Super Mario Odyssey
5. Pikmin 2
6. Mario Kart 7
7. Xenogears
8. Splatoon 2
9. Fire Emblem: Awakening
10. Kirby Star Allies
-----
Cartridge Games: Probably Zelda. I think the anime works better than the games (especially the last few), but I guess an anime is pretty relevant even if it’s not the most eye candy anime
-----
LavaBadger: The Last Story and Fire Emblem seem tailor made for the franchise. I got invested in the characters in Fates, and that's like a 3D anime.
I'd add Pikmin 3 for the next one.
-----
Phantom Thief: Fire Emblem is the most interesting, but I’m not sure Pikmin 3 is a match for Fates.
-----
Buckle: I'm going to say Super Mario O so Pikmin 3 is a win.
-----
BocoDragon: I’m a big fan of the Breath of the Wild series so I will say Smash Ultimate will
====================
~!~Could a Smash Bros Ultimate Direct come at the right time?

LordByron28: With the new year fast approaching, I think it would be great to have a dedicated discussion thread to discuss and bounce ideas off of.
I think it is a great time to get to know the new Smash Bros and Nintendo are really in need of a big Smash Bros for the 2019.
My personal take is a Smash Direct is the best way to do it. I am willing to give any game a better chance as long as it does not have a barebones announcement and release date.
What do you think?

Error 52: I'm in favor of a Direct.

Mr-Joker: Yeah, Nintendo needs more time to think about their core games. They have talked about Smash for over a year now and they have already announced all of their core titles and more are on the way.

DecoReturns: Please.

FiXalaS: Smash Bros? No.

~!~How do you plan out your gaming life?

Jingo: My partner wants to buy us a house and we're renting a room. We're both mixed on the idea of it being our own place, meh.
But I just wanted to ask if it is normal to want to play together in bed, but I'm not sure.
I can only play with my wife, and I can't be having a game room if I don't have her either. 
What do you guys do?
-----
VonGreckler: My house is like that. We both play when we can. We use to do the hall and then the table or whatever. 
But we moved to the other side of the house thier is more comfortable. I mean I moved into the study and all my older stuff was in the garage so we are good.
-----
Saint-14: If we play together room together then yes. Otherwise my house is our own house.
-----
Dancrane212: Play tabletop and tabletop stands/dabs or whatever for couch multiplayer.
I'll take turns playing couch versus consoles.
-----
mindsale: Play a game or tabletop together. That’s it.
-----
Jingo: I mean I don't play anything with the kitchen sink.
-----
Plum: I also have a rule against it, but I don't have the same inclination. I make my living with a living room setup. If I want to play with friends it is usually on the Xbox couch, Switch on the TV. But if I want to play with my wife I can use the TV in the living room if she's with me... I do have a rule about not having two consoles connected to my living room setup but that's it.
-----
Dancrane212: I only have one TV at home with me, so there's no game room setup unfortunately. I have a PC in the living room with a monitor and a PC in the living room with a game pad.
-----
Dancrane212: I use a 4K TV for all my gaming stuff so in tabletop gaming there's no issue.

~!~God of War's Boxmark Environments

TransEuropaExpress: I've been playing God of War recently and, while I've been playing other games a bit, the one that jumps to mind for me is the God of War Boxmark Environments.
Nothing quite comes close to the gorgeous, well-done original look of the original God of War but, for the first time, I've come up with one that's stuck with me for the longest time.
This one specifically came from a patch in the original release of the sequel that allowed you to take all the places you took before the later editions and change them up for the sake of modding. While the original areas were already quite detailed, some of the models were just jaw-dropping looking. The texture work of the original God of War is just insane, which I can only assume is due to the fact that the pre-rendered backgrounds of the sequels were done by hand.
For those that have played the sequels, can you recommend any of the new ones that you have tried? I own them all, and they're certainly a looker.
-----
Ricky_R: I remember playing Gran Turismo 4 in the original release. Not unlike this.
I remember being so overwhelmed by all the physics and stuff.
I remember driving to the first race of the first game and being like "what the fuck?"
I think GT4 was the first game in the series to have the AI that would run away from you if you ran in front of them, so it was a very cool idea.
-----
TransEuropaExpress: The first one was indeed terrifying, the second one was indeed a complete dumbnuts nightmare.
-----
DriftingSpirit: I completely forgot about this.
It was one of the first games I ever played.
I remember driving to the first level of GT4 and being absolutely confused for a second time.
I went back to GT4 and was completely confused as to how the game was supposed to play.
I was like "this is old but awful".

Kain-Nosgoth: i remember playing GOW2 in the PS2 emulated version, its great!

~!~What are some RTS (RTS) style games?

Thewonandonly: So I’m a big RTS fan but I never got into RTS games until 2011/12th gen. I was hyped but didn’t play them. I wanted to get into RTS games and I started playing classic RTS games like Command & Conquer and Mirror's Edge. I’ve played maybe half of Mirror’s Edge 2 and I liked it but the first game was just alright and the sequel was even better. Mirror’s Edge was just okay but nothing I played yet. I heard good things about Mirror’s Edge and thought I’d give it a shot. So I watched a few streams and read some feedback on the developer’s website but I never got too far in the end. So I’m wondering what the general consensus is. 
I’m not expecting RTS games to have very complex or complex design but I wonder if there’s other popular and highly complex games out there that are much more accessible or fun with a P.T.
Does Era play RTS games or is it more about fun and having a good time?
-----
butman: I played Siege for a few hours last week and I really liked it.
-----
GUSH: Came to post this.
I've played Siege a few hours and I'm liking it.
-----
Thewonandonly: Yeah I have been watching Siege a few hours and I really liked it but I remember how bad the control scheme was and the whole aim system for movement was terrible lol and they were awful. Haven't played siege since.
-----
MrH: I feel like if you want a little bit of a challenge you can go whole hog on the RTS genre and do better than the most polished and well designed RTS out there, you can't really go wrong either.
-----
Thewonandonly: That’s what I was wondering also is I’m not a fan of the whole “movement” you can hold left and right and you just move the left and right and you have like a 10 second delay lol. You can do alot better then that. But I like a little bit of fun and I like a little bit of experience to be had. I would love to play RTS games but I can�

~!~PS4 Pro Performance Thread

JaseC: (Click for general game info.)
System requirements:
Latest drivers: (as at 02/04/2019)
Nvidia: 425.11 Hotfix

Tips and tricks:
Cap the frame rate/potentially improve frame times (1): Download RivaTuner Statistics Server, input your desired framerate limit in the "Framerate limit" box, and hit enter (the program comes bundled with MSI Afterburner and earlier versions of EVGA PrecisionX). Alternatively, those with an Nvidia GPU have the option of Nvidia Inspector, which can also be used to impose a framerate cap, either in a similar manner to RTSS or by way of forcing a different vsync interval (click the small tool icon to open the game profile section).
Note: Useful if you your system can't maintain, say, 60fps and you're sensitive to the wild fluctuations, or you're experiencing uneven frametimes. The greater window the engine has to render a given frame, if you're imposing a lower framerate than the game can otherwise provide, may also help in alleviating stuttering related to data streaming.
Potentially improve frame times (2): Use exclusive fullscreen rather than borderless fullscreen. (Credit to Knurek.)
Stop the game from crashing after 15 minutes on touch-capable systems running Windows 10: Open the task manager, switch to the Services tab and disable TabletInputService.
Put some context behind those graphics settings values: Sift through the Scalability Reference section of the Unreal Engine 4 documentation. (Credit to Durante.)
Change the language: Right-click the game in your Steam Library.
Increase the frame rate cap: Open C:\Users\[username]\Documents\my games\Borderlands 2\The Pre Sequel\ Presequel\ GotG.EXE (this will change some things such as the draw distances and other details.) C:\Users\[username]\Documents\my games\Borderlands 2\The Pre Sequel\Prequel

~!~Giles & Mastema: The Prophet (arcade game)

Dusk Golem: I made a little bit of progress on a very old school arcade game that was a port of a Ruby Drop on PC port.
It started off very well, but the initial barrier of entry was a lot lower than I expected. The game has a limited inventory for the inventory, so you have to either run away from the enemies to get through it, or wait for the exit to be so you can move towards the exit.
After getting the hang of it, you can decide to run away from the enemy and wait for it to blow up. It's a very long ride and you can easily get lost a lot, but the main thing is the Prophet, and her team consists of a lot of faceless men. They all have kill streaks, and there are countless instances of both sides in the first encounter.
The Prophet has very quick reflexes, while Mastema has a longer one, but the Prophet's team consists of a lot of faceless, mercs. They all have skill bars on auto attack and they do a lot of damage, but in the end it's up to you whether you actually back at them or not. There is a skill shown on auto attack that stands on your cooldown and for a short time, then you wait a bit and use it until the next full turn.
The Prophet has a cool skill, but it's mostly just talking to the other team. Mastema has a much more interesting skill set, that also comes with the game. All skill bars are active and you can see them on cooldown, but in general they are not really featured enough, because the game is very linear and there are no need for a lot of branching or branching in the game.
So I'll keep this more in-depth, for when questions come up in the comments.

====================
~!~Does anyone get super hyped for a new Hitman game?

Maneil99: I feel like this type of game can be really effective on people if done right. It gives them a fresh faced something to play and makes them want to tackle some challenging encounters.
For example, on The Division I was playing for an hour and was still excited. 
Now I'm just playing the Patient Zero mission and just picked up a radio beacon for the first time in a mission.
Like am I being super excited for something like Patient Zero?
I remember playing the Witcher 3 and being excited for Nilin, but the game is so little more than that.
-----
nynt9: I don't get hyped for my games. I think Hitman 2 is an excellent example of this. It's more of a means to a player than an endgame.
-----
Maneil99: Yeah I feel like this type of mission focus alone can make or break a game.
-----
Cess007: I mean, I haven't played a ton of Hitman, but I've always been excited for it. I think I'm still the biggest person that thinks I'd be able to handle a first person game, but I just haven't been able to. I just remember the first time I saw the first levels of a Hitman game. I was so excited.
-----
Glio: I am hyped for Cyberpunk but I am not really hyped for this series
-----
Maneil99: Well, I think it's time for me to play Watch Dogs 2, although I think it is far more difficult and involves more enemies than I thought.
-----
MazeHaze: I mean, I'm hyped for Uncharted all the way but I'm not really hyped for this one.
-----
MazeHaze: One is that you can literally get lost in a map/level/enemy list and you'll be much more curious to check/play a guide or read about what's going on.
The other is that the missions are pretty fun. The "skeleton men" are the only annoying enemies that are really hard to get through, but they're hard to not annoy significantly.

Pagoto93: I have hyped for Hitman 1 on and off and for a couple of hours in every single mission. Nothing has topped the first few missions.

~!~How is the Switch port of Octopath Trave....?

Revolsin: I don't really know much about the Switch market that I've been keeping an eye on. 
Octopath was a pre-release game and newcomers to the franchise aren't exactly high on the switch’s enthusiast boards so it’s not exactly my place to compare it to that. 
I’ve just been wondering if the Switch version even runs as well as a comparable version of Octopath? I couldn’t find any information online. 
I guess I'm wondering if it can still handle more RPG’s in terms of world building and its ability to explore its world?
-----
KZXcellent: It's visually a lot of what you're looking for in a JRPG. I don't think it's that good but I can really see how people are going to like it. It can be a lot of fun and there's a lot of content to do.
-----
Phantom Thief: It's a great game, if you're not gonna play Final Fantasy 7 on Switch, you should. It's not a great JRPG though, it's just not a JRPG, at all.
-----
srtrestre: I think it's pretty good.
-----
Eolz: I think it's good.
It's not perfect, it's not that great and the world isn't that big, but it's still a pretty good game.
-----
Fantastapotamus: It's not far off being above SMT4, BotW and Monster Hunter in terms of being a pretty decent JRPG.
-----
fiendcode: It's pretty good. Get it if you're not a super hardcore RPG fan but it's worth a shot.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I heard good things about it.
-----
Phantom Thief: I don’t know. I think the biggest thing [in particular the controls] are pretty bad. They’re grindy, they’re dumbed down, and they’re probably not designed for anything below them. I enjoyed it for the first 2 hours and then lost interest because of the grind. I think the next game was particularly good at that.

====================
~!~Kirby Star Allies is the best Kirby game to date.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): And, to a lesser extent, the only game that I truly enjoyed, the 3DS version. 
It was received pretty well across the board with a large amount of reviews coming out praising the game, it's aesthetic, controls, controls, controls. It had the best pre-release hype of the year and was everywhere's go to get their hands on this game. A lot of people weren't sure what to expect, the story, the gameplay, the music, the gameplay... it was all so right. 
To date, I haven't played a Kirby game (including the PS1 original) that I truly, truly liked besides the Wii U one. I haven't played a game that I've thought was especially difficult, a game that I've thought was particularly difficult. I haven't played a game that I thought was particularly difficult, a game that I thought was particularly difficult. To this day, the only one that I felt particularly managed to grasp was Super Star, and that game. 
I know a lot of people didn't quite get it, and a lot of people didn't seem to get it, but I still feel like Kirby games are kind of a rarity. I love them, but I think it's kind of a shame, especially considering that the series is pretty popular. I liked the first Skylanders, I rented one on GC, borrowed it from my brother and beat it, then sent it off for a refund. I still have some of my old saves intact, and I've got them on PSN. I've just gotten Kirby Star Allies, and I feel like I might have something pretty special there. 
All three versions are pretty different, but I think it's kind of underrated. I haven't bought a new game for more than $10.

Zacmortar: Best Kirby game
Best Kirby soundtrack
Best 2D platforming
Best in between Classic and Star Allies 
Mostly the right mix of old and modern

~!~What do you think of the "Players Only" part of Xbox Live?

Gamer17: So the other day I thought about it. I also thought about how nice it would be if there were some achievements/trophies in my game which i could only access via Xbox 360 achievement system.
But since then i noticed i could easily get achievements by playing the games i liked.
Then i noticed they are where achievements are.
The achievement system is more user friendly and the games are more console agressive.
I just realized this is something i never realized before.
Im at a point in life where i have a ton of games and can easily get all achievements on the catalog.
So what about you guys and gals?
-----
Theorry: I mean its not very user friendly. Nothing to be angry about or say about it.
-----
icespide: Very user friendly. They do a lot of the things you would expect for it
-----
Bjones: It’s very good and adds variety to the library.
-----
Einchy: It's very good. It's a good feature for sure. But I don't think it adds anything that can make me go "wow, this is so good!" Horizon Zero Dawn was a great game, but I don't think it was worth me unlocking achievements before playing through it. I think it adds a lot of things to the game, but I don't know, I can't say for sure what they are for.
-----
Norton F: They are pretty great and so are the achievements, but I don't care for them much.
-----
Majora85: They're fine. I managed to get all achievements in Horizon without them.
-----
FairyEmpire: It's a nice feature, but it's not very good. I've unlocked a few achievements by just playing through the game, but I hardly ever touch it. I think I would love a few more like the first couple of Horizon, but not nearly enough to warrant a 100% improvement.
-----
Gamer17: Ah ok. I dont see any achievement page on here.
I see people posting stats on achievements and on how the game is better...
-----
DarkChronic: I like them and I appreciate they're there, but they are so rarely used. I think I've gotten ~5 achievements...

~!~What's the best way to play the first 3 Final Fantasy games?

WarpSpeedMolasses: I've been wanting to play FFIV, and I've found the 3rd game is still my favorite entry in the series. 
What's the best way to play the first three mainline games (IIRC, VI, and VII). I've read that they feature a lot of jank, but I'm having a blast with VII. I've read that the intro video doesn't play exactly as well, though I'm having fun at least with a little bit of charm. 
Which other versions of these games should I actually play? Have they all been bad? Is there just a reason to import third party games? I don't want to spend a large amount of money on the 3DS here, but I would prefer to play them on my Switch.
-----
brokeastronaut: I'm in the same boat. I've always wanted to play the 3 old ones, but never have been able ti play them without using a save method that requires me to reset my party at least once.
-----
Plywood: I haven't played them, but IV:A is my favorite one.
-----
Phendrift: I believe that the first few hours of III are rough since they don’t have as much action as the first two, but IV is so underrated it hurts.
IV is a better FF than FFX, but still not as good as the 2nd one

~!~Trying to purchase a PC again

TheBeardedOne: I just moved back in a couple of months. Now I'm trying to get a new PC for the time being. All the ports, all the games that haven't been released yet, but some I'm still waiting on a sale on.
I've been buying a lot of PC exclusives lately, it seems. I think FFXIV is the best example of this. But I'm also looking for games that aren't out yet. What's the best example? I don't want to go through the hassle of finding out every game I need.
I own an MSI B450 Motherboard, but I also own a PNY Motherboard, and a Dell XPS 15 Backward Compatibility System. I've also bought a certain PC for a few years, but I'm not sure when I'll actually buy one. I'm just curious on which other examples of this are.
I would love some input on what games you have and how many of them you have, and how much effort you take to actually finish games.
-----
Krejlooc: I think you can buy a PC for a platform you own. It's not a hardware platform, it's a software platform. You "own" the platform and all the exclusive stuff, so you have a license to play the games. The only exclusives that are exclusive to your PC are The Witcher 3 and Witcher 3 DLCs. Everything else you can just buy a new PC, but if you don't own one already, a new one.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Thanks. I'll check the prices on Steam, but I'm not sure what the best quote is.
-----
Krejlooc: Thanks. I'll check the prices on Steam, but I'm not sure what the best quote is.

TheBeardedOne: I'm not informed yet, but I can certainly understand where you're coming from.
I haven't owned a PC in my life, but I did own a launch PC, and a launch console (Xbox). As much as I love my windows computer and Xbox, my old PC was the real gaming machine. I owned my Nintendo 64 at launch when it came out and had a Nintendo 64XL at launch. That was my first gaming computer. I had a Nintendo 64 during that time, and a PS4 at launch.

~!~[Digital Foundry] Xbox Scarlett - A big change?

space_nut: Great video from Digital Foundry
So in this part he covers the start of the next generation. It covers the next gen with Scarlett but also the current gen. I have to clarify that I'm referring to the actual specs of the console itself.
I'm just wondering if this is a fair comparison or if this also needs to be a short summary.
Original Article
When I first read the first paragraph of the article, I was hoping this information would get updated and we could see what improvements we would get from the next gen consoles. I realize that the author is playing catch up to Xbox. In doing so he's come to see that the author is also playing catch up to Xbox.
In the quote below he's stating that the specs of the console itself will be revealed in a future article.
Next Gen: What will we see the most improvements from next gen systems? I think a big part of what's being described will be generational leaps and not just with the next consoles. What improvements will we still see in the next consoles? I've been curious about this.
Next Gen: What do you think we will see? I think there's a lot of smoke to the conversation.
Next Gen: What do you think generational improvements will look like?

Jade1962: The new consoles are going to be able to deliver on all those specs.
-----
Puroresu_kid: With the announcement of the next Xbox it's clear MS has made some bad moves in the past couple of generations. I say this as a next gen guy.
-----
nekkid: The author makes fun of Xbox One X's specs.
"Quality CPUs and GPU's are what make Xbox One X so appealing. They aren't anywhere near the level of the previous-gen consoles. They're also struggling to hit 60 FPS and holding a lead in all three current console generations."

~!~How is the Switch's battery life measured in this day and age?

Denman: I've been juicing a lot of my Switch lately, and I've been thinking about how long it will take me to replace the battery. I really, really want the Switch to be as powerful as it can be, and I know that Nintendo is aware of this and is working on ways to improve that.
The battery life of the Switch has been on and off for about a week now, and it's absolutely dismal. The official time constant for it is 36 hours, and I know that's because of the sleep feature. I've heard that it's really uncomfortable to play, and the battery in the dock hasn't even fully battery, so I've been hoping for a "dumb battery" battery by now.
The official time constant for it is 36 hours, and I've heard that battery replacement kits are coming. What are the real world long term health and environmental effects of lithium time constant charge/LiD time devices? Is there any scientific studies to evaluate if the official battery time would be better with a lithium time battery? Are new electric vehicles on the market/electric vehicles worth investing in in the future?
I'm just curious.
-----
Syril: I take it that you can recharge it with Henium?
-----
Denman: Yes, currently they’re only available for preorder and pre-drank.
-----
Syril: Hopefully the time spent on Henium and its usage will be enough to improve their product but I don't think that's the case at all.
-----
Denman: I tried several times to get it in the UK. All seemed to be abandoned, at least I had no idea of the date. It's a rather small lithium battery in comparison that you just plug into a USB power source and it lasts me hours.
-----
Syril: Thank you. I'll check that out.

Denman: That's great, thanks for the response!

I've played through 1, 2, and Birth By Sleep. All three collections on PS1 have some of the best level design in all of video games I have ever experienced.
I've finished the first entry and I've enjoyed my time with it. I'm one of those weird people who would enjoy KH like I do, but not like it enough to warrant a second playthrough.
I've also replayed the original trilogy. Despite being enjoyable and with a nice story, I didn't really enjoy the second half of the game. I'm having difficulty adjusting to the new gameplay loop and I'm starting to feel the difficulty might be a little unfair sometimes.
I've played the first Kingdom Hearts game. I've been told that it doesn't really matter. I've heard that it's the same gameplay system as 1 and 2 but with some QoL improvements. I've also seen that it's a single player game with cutscenes and it's apparently not really janky and it's a lot of fun.
I've also seen that the story is convoluted, but I don't think that is an excuse for why I don't like it as much as I think I do.
I've also heard that the writing is not as good as 1 and 2. I've also heard that 2 and 1 haven't aged well and that KH1 is a bit too slow.
I've also seen that the gameplay is not as good as 1 and 2. I've also seen that 1 is a bit more difficult than 2, but it gets easier as you get further in.
I've also heard that playing 1 and 2 first might be beneficial. So that's kind of my berserk thought.
So Era, what are your thoughts on this? How does it compare to Birth by Sleep? Are they essential for the story? Are they enjoyable?
-----
WrenchNinja: It's the best 3D Disney game in years and a 10/10 game is more than enough for a good story.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I remembered reading that it's not really a service, but a spinoff of the KH series.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: I didn't play BBS when it was released.

LordOcidax: Looks like Bethesda/ZeniMax is going back to publishing.
-----
Svart: That trailer has already gone up. lol
-----
LordOcidax: I didnt know this happens.
-----
FairyEmpire: Considering it's been like 10 years since the last Bethesda game, this is a pretty big deal. I guess they're really going back to more linear/non-linear RPG games after all.

Hella: "previous 2D-ish classics"
I keep forgetting this game exists.

~!~Your favorite Mario Kart speed Racer?

SolVanderlyn: I love fast laps, fast laps, and the best racing games of all time. Mario Kart has a really great track design, which is what really makes it so fun to play.
But speed racers are not my favorite kind of racing games. I love Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart 7, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart 7, Mario Tennis Aces, and even Mario Kart DS.
But I love Ultra Street: Wily Circuit.
Normally, I don't like fast laps, but Wily's Circuit is a blast to play. It's a great time, and you can really get that itch from the first 30-60 minutes of the game.
What do people call the best speed racer of all time?
-----

Fantomas: Streetfighter games are pretty good.
-----
Viking Jesus: That's a good pick.
-----
BubbleButt64: I think Street Fighter's Street Fighter is the best at what it's trying to do and why it's the best in general.
-----
Caiusto: Sonic Racing (Sonic Advance)
-----
Mazzle: Sonic Rush
-----

Mediking: I love speed, but I also love speed and fighting games...
-----
Fuchsia: I love the Street Fighter series. I also love fighting games, but I also love Smash Bros. I don't think I ever beat Mega Man 1 or 2 on either of those.

====================
~!~Would you be interested in a new Ratchet and Clank?

Memento: Recently I've been playing R&C: Director's Cut and I've been replaying it with a friend through the PS3 version of the PS4 version and it made me think about how much fun it was to actually play the game.
I remember when it came out, Sony had an ad campaign asking people to purchase a PS4 for R&C games (they were super expensive) and I was pretty excited about it.
It is a game that I remember was very acclaimed from the critics but was a total letdown. I remember thinking it was a very easy game to teach someone to play through, but I also remember the story being very confusing and the gameplay very very easy.
I remember thinking playing as Ratchet in the game was very fun and doesn't scared me. I remember I wanted to be the bad guy and be able to beat the game without dying. I know now, I want to play the game again.
Do you guys think it would be fun to play with someone who didn't play the game for the first time and wanted to train on the Ratchet and Clank franchise?
I think it would be more annoying to play this game with someone who only played the original 2 games and didn't have a PSN Plus or didn't own a console at all.
-----
HussiZooT: Not at all.
I was interested in the game after I got an E3 demo.
-----
Certinfy: It was a good trick to train them on the game, especially the end boss.
If you aren’t playing the game at all I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, especially someone new to the series.
-----
KZXcellent: I think it would be more confusing and frustrating.
-----
TheBaldwin: Not at all. 
The game wouldnt teach them how to play, it wouldnt help them understand the game.
Its annoying as hell though, I feel like a lot of people just wouldnt want to interact with the game, especially the end boss.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: Yes, I'd be interested in it. Not sure how I feel if I was playing as Ratchet but I would.
-----
Phendrift: I’d be interested in it, but not sure if

~!~Twitch Streamer 'The Typing of Liberty' Designing Video for Twitch

Jawmuncher: While the article provides a few details about the process of getting a video on your preferred channels, it works like a charm. Being a streamer isn't something I can qualify for due to the whole concept of Titling a video with a certain flavor and all involved. The article also discusses the different types of video channels that are allowed to interfere with the production of video.
I'm interested in seeing this happen with more music channels. Especially if they utilize music as the background for the videos.
-----
Jintor: This is cool, but I can see why they don't allow it. At least let it be a license for some composers to make use of background music.
-----
Svart: This is cool but I wish on more regions.
-----
Soulflarz: Haha yeah no
-----
Xiao Hu: I think that's about music.

Jintor: Ah, I get it. I'll check in a bit

~!~Is the Switch's reach a guarantee to be any different with games?

The Swapper: I'm just curious as to what the current situation is for the Switch and how does the platform compare to other platforms on the market. It's my understanding that the Switch is more a home console for hardcore fans rather than a handheld for casual audiences but I'm wondering if the Switch's hardcore base can offer a competitive advantage in this space over the competition?
-----
kjtc1979: It's a terrible combination. If you want a great portable experience, go for it.
-----
FireWarrior: nope, i agree, switch is a better value proposition than the other platforms, even if switch is better in every conceivable way
-----
Kunka Kid: Yeah, I think it's a better value proposition than the other platforms.
It's a good system, but the clunky design of the controls can definitely be put down to it. The only console I can think of in any way is the Gamecube which also has the joycons.
-----
Derachi: It’s not. The other platforms are better at what they’re doing, while Sony and Nintendo get some of the flak. They’re different beasts and all that.
-----
Vadara: It certainly helps that Switch is basically an indie console.
-----
Datajoy: The Switch is literally just a handheld for casual fans, that's it. It's a big baby console, decent graphics, decent size, decent battery life, good wifi chip...
-----
Comic Obsessed: Not a guarantee.
-----
Acquiescence: I find it hard to believe that handhelds would ever be worse for what the market currently offers but the fact is that Nintendo's biggest hits are still going to be on the Switch.

~!~Do you think that the next Zelda will use the Zelda Engine?

Sphinx: I mean, I'm sure it won't, but I'd be super curious about it and would love to hear your thoughts and speculation.
-----
Neiteio: I think so, and if they use the same engine as BotW, I'd be in, since it's a very similar thing.
-----
Neiteio: My answer: Probably.
-----
bunkitz: I don't think it'll use the Zelda Engine, but it's very possible.
-----
TheMoon: I'm thinking the BotW Engine would work better or worse, but I've noticed that the more I've watched the Zelda games, the more I've thought of the engine before. BotW was a good example.
-----
Neiteio: It's fucking amazing how they pulled it off.
-----
Cartridge Games: I'm hoping it works out for the Zelda games.
Zelda games don’t need to look anywhere near the Zelda engine, which is fine by me.
-----
Sphinx: I know people said the same thing about BOTW but I don't think it will.
-----
Cartridge Games: I’d guess it’s the same engine, but it’ll be different for other Zelda games.
Though I’m a bit worried that it’s not the engine for BotW but for the Zelda games.
-----
Exentryk: I think it wouldn’t work for BotW.

~!~Do you want Retro Studios to work on a new Star Fox game?

SG-17: Or are they already doing so?
I was just thinking about the possibility of this. I know Retro Studios is mostly known for the Command and Conquer franchise. Do you want a new Command & Conquer game?
I've been thinking about the possibility of a new Command & Conquer.
-----
Evil Monkey DTT: Yes, they should.
-----
Error 52: Maybe they should take their time and do it they’re not gonna announce it for a modern show like MS starts their show annually
-----
Weiss: I doubt they'll make a new game, but it's something I'd be interested in seeing if it was a new IP or if they applied some of their IPs to something new.
-----
Megatron: I don't think they would, but I think they would try.
-----
AlteredBeast: I don't think they would, but I would love to see it happen.
-----
funky: I would not be ok with that.
-----
Pilgrimzero: I wouldnt be ok with that either.
-----
Yossarian: Hell yes.
-----
Phendrift: Eh, I’d just take their time. I think it’d be genius if they do something fresh with their IPs and give us a new Command & Conquer game

====================
~!~Xbox One X boost in play is not worth it for anyone looking for a 4K Blu-Ray

MBS: The problem with the X is that the Blu-Rays aren't really worth the cash. It's only $100 more expensive than a Blu-Ray. 
Well, the good thing is that once you finish the story of KOTOR on the original game, you can replay the whole thing on the X. We have a thread already, if you want to talk about why the X is better. 
The only reason why I'm here is to share my personal experience with the game, on the X, and now I'm here to ask if I should buy a Blu-ray player. I own a 4K HDR TV and play KOTOR on it, but it won't let me play KotOR on my Xbox. I should, it saves me the hassle of buying an X for the old games.
-----
Mitsurugi: Because I’d be lying if I said I’d change my mind about that. I’m the type of person who talks about his console more and would rather buy something new. I can wait till he gets his 4K or whatever.
-----
Darknight: I really like the X. I bought it solely for games like this but think the retail pricing is way too high. As long as it's worth the extra $100 I think it will be worth it.
-----
Mitsurugi: Thank you very much man. I was about to mention that but it’s true
-----
Liam Allen-Miller: I’m in the same boat. My experience has been that if I want to play a game and it’s similar I better go for it over anything that comes out on the X.
-----
InsaneTiger: I agree. If I got my PS4 for a few games and I wanted to go back to it, I would but I'd just wait for an X if I was going to rebuy and buy it.
-----
Cess007: I agree. I own a 4k TV and I play KOTOR with HDR. But I really hate buying new consoles. I've been spoiled by everything having been a PS4, and to this day, there's still a problem in buying new consoles that is not a problem in normal games.

-----
ghibli99: My favorite part of the Sonic movie was hearing this:
That was a really cool moment. That said, please be happy! It's kind of like the one-two punch of Boom and Silver's movie cast getting robbed last week in this movie.
-----
Chaos2Frozen: I'm just happy people are still working on a big, original animated movie.
-----
Camjo-Z: The film was shot in 2012 and has been in production for almost 4 years now, so that's actually pretty impressive.
-----
Green Slime King: The movie came out last year I believe.

The 8-Bit A-Life: Just when it really seemed to settle into a groove.

====================
~!~Dextime (PC) is the best game of all time

ScOULaris: I just played through it for the first time, and here are some of my favorite memories.
What an awesome little game!
I remember being obsessed with finding all the secrets across the various stages and discovering new abilities every time, and even more when I played it for the first time.
The soundtrack, the art style, the music, the music. It's everything.
I can't praise this game enough. It's a seriously fun, addictive experience that nails its gameplay mechanics and tight gameplay design.
I also remember sitting out a few events in the game knowing no other pro when it came time to play it. I always found myself just grinding stages and getting destroyed. I even got into the gold chest thing after the final boss, but I never got past the second stage. At that point, I had already played most other games in the series, so I just had to play them, and enjoy them just fine.
It's so good. I wish I had more of this game but it's so good I only have the urge to play it again.
-----
Starlatine: I didn't play it for the gameplay (I loved it when I played it for the story) but it's still a really good game. One of the best stories in gaming and IMO the best in the genre as well.
The challenge is overreaching and absurd. There are actually some really cool puzzles to solve and I love the atmosphere of the game.
Also the soundtrack is one of my favorites in a game. One of my favorites in general.
-----
Theswweet: Yeah, it's easily better than most of the games in the genre.
-----
Almagest: I love it, but the best is City Shrouded in Shadow. It's a truly unique experience.
-----
Starlatine: It's second only to The Last of Us for me personally. It's not a masterpiece by any stretch but it's very unique and a really unique experience. Such a unique experience with such a strong sense of identity.
-----
Starlatine: I think it's the best in the genre but i personally have never beaten it. i have beat the first game and syndicate, but never won the second. i still really like the game though and the story and puzzle design has not leave a

~!~How would you feel if Nintendo Switch 2 happened?

Meelow: It is happening now and with it, Nintendo has arguably saved Nintendo handhelds from the clutches of classic consoles like SNES and N64.
If it happened, what would it be like?
-----
ILikeFeet: they'll be back to doing their own thing. and they'll be able to do as they always have. they'll have a few more games on the eShop
-----
Khanimus: I'm sure it would still take more than a year for them to make another Switch.
-----
kennyamr: I don't think Nintendo will change. I think they'll continue on as it is.
-----
RadioJoNES: I think it would be a great thing, but Nintendo is not known for making systems that they actually use.
-----
Comic Obsessed: If they want to stay relevant, I will be all for it. If they want to fuck it up, I'm all for it.
-----
pld: I would be all for it.
-----
Jaded Alyx: They're still making new games.
-----
Pablo Mesa: no, they dont need to quit.
-----
Phendrift: I’d be up for it. However, I think they could probably do a lot more with the switch in terms of software and I’d hope they learned something from their experience

~!~This is the most boring intro in a video game

TheSubsequentStrajack: I've been playing video games since I was 4 years old. I believe it came out in the early 90's in a magazine and I was told that one of my favorite games of all time was Contra. I had never played a Contra game before so I was immediately reminded of the intro to that game and man. The music, the character designs, the story. None of it made me cringe but it made me elated.
What other games actually used this intro?
-----
labpleb: That's not the first time I've heard the music in a video game intro, it's the first time.
-----

TheSubsequentStrajack: I really enjoyed that intro.
-----
Fancy Clown: The opening of Snake to Metal Gear Solid 3
All these years later?

~!~How's the portability of Super Mario Odyssey?

Meelow: I've been playing this game for a week but havent actually started to get hooked into it. The controls are a bit finicky and it's just a tad too similttly for my taste. Is there anything I can try on the Switch version?
-----
Cartridge Games: I haven’t started it but I’d imagine a lot of the controls are pretty wonky.
It is pretty much a downgrade from the Wii U version.
-----
WonderLuigi: The controls are pretty bad and it's hard to play it on Wii U.
-----
Meelow: But at least the game is on Switch.
-----
Tron1: Hmmm. I’d say play it on Wii U then
-----
neon_dream: It's a better game than the Wii U version, but it's not terrible.
The controls have been improved, annoying and frustrating at times. I know it's a Wii U port and one of the many reasons it's not coming to the Switch, but think about it. Many Wii U games were just patched in.
-----
Meelow: Well my gamming skills haven't improved much, but it's always fun to mess around with now.
-----
Carolina Reaper: The controls are pretty bad, the Wii U version didn't improve it at all.
-----
Syril: I have to say that the controls feel terrible in a lot of ways, but the overall experience is worth it.

~!~What is the best way to play, finished and proud games?

scarlet: I have a long story. My mom never asked for it to be finished before. I told her and she asked for it to be completed. and she asked for it to be put on sale at the drop of a hat. I mean, that is like asking for a job to pay for. The sales are fierce. 
I have a lot of work to do. I still need to finish all chapters, put in all kinds of characters and put out the last few chapters. I am still working on the presentation of the story. I am still working on all the connections and so forth. 
I really want to finish some games. I have started a few but they are not really considered the best. I want to finish Spiderman. 
I want to finish a lot. 
So, what is the best way to do so? I understand that the games are buggy/unfinished, but I wanted to be sure. 
Is it the best way to finish a game? Or is it more accurate to use a complete game that is already much more polished? 
I know it sounds stupid, but I think it is really important to have a game that you have finished and can be focused more on playing, and then you can consider a sequel for you to play. 
I am not into multiplayer, is my husband not? Is it an easy way to support your family? Or does your wife not play games anymore. 
I want to finish a game, but I feel like I am not getting the most out of the process. I am not a professional. My time is limited and there is not that many games that I can play at the same time.
-----
LossAversion: Gonna start playing through Persona 5 eventually. I'm about 25 now. Gameplay might take a while, but I'm here to play and finish the story. I've been watching my wife play for the last few years and she's actually enjoying it. She thinks it's sort of a slog, but I can see the appeal. I'm currently up to the second half of the game, and I have some really fun character builds to work with. I'll be playing Persona 5 Arena when it releases. I just got done with the first half of the game.

~!~So how is Hearts of Iron?

Zephyrielion: I just finished it on PS4 today and I love this game. I love the characters, the story and the characters. The combat system is simple enough, yet engaging enough for a fighting game. The gameplay is addicting yet deep enough for it to keep me going. I bought the game on Vita but I've yet to finish it since I'm busy with God of War and plan to this year.
I've also played the demo and really liked it. I recommend it if you like action games in a 3D environment, it does not disappoint. The music is really good and the atmosphere and setting is great.
I'm a huge fan of the series and it's a shame the game is so hard to find these days. There was a PS2 remaster but there is no way to legally play it anymore, there is also no way to buy it anymore on PSN.
Anyone else have any other games like this?
-----
Mediking: I like it. I'm in the mood for more action games. But yeah I love me some action games.
-----
Daffy Duck: I own it on PS4 but I can't remember how well it held up.
I'll give it another try on PC.
-----
SofNascimento: I liked it well enough, but I don't think it holds up. 
It's not a very long game, but it can be a bit frustrating at times. I don't think it's for everyone, though.
-----
Derrick01: Not being able to pause saves is a common complaint with it. That's honestly the biggest selling point of the game IMHO.
-----
mazi: i played it on pc and liked it but it's been discontinued.
i think it's a decent enough game but i feel like it's mostly been ignored because people love the genre and don't tend to talk about it.
-----
Ametroid: It's fun but you can't just level up skills and stuff which is why you're grinding for money and doing it in the first place is similar to souls games

Benji: Open in new thread
I personally have played pretty much all the games I own and am yet to see the most played games.
I guess this is a new thing in this thread as I was just curious if any of you guys have any Nintendo games that you play?
-----
Cartridge Games: I’ve played almost all of them, but I have an hour or so where I platinum'd every game I own.
Probably not the most different than the list I provided, but I’d recommend giving Smash and Metroid a shot.
-----
phanphare: Mario Party and Pokemon are definitely the ones I play the least, but I definitely play all of those when I'm done with work. I have a few hours of Smash and Metroid a day, and I challenge myself every time I finish.
I'll also do the occasional online tournament of Pokemon.
-----
Blablurn: I have about 150 hours in mario kart.
-----
maximumzero: I've played about 150 of my friends' Mario Party sessions with randoms between 1-6.
-----
Benji: Oh yeah, I'm sure most people play MP, but I don't have a computer good enough yet to really benchmark gameplay.
-----
Aigis: I don't have a pc but I do have a xbox one sitting around where I play splatoon so I guess my question is less about game performance vs. convenience than console profitability.
I am a console guy but idk if my friends will have both. Imagine if I had to find the smallest Xbox to play fortnite, only to find out its for my kids to play with fortnite as well.

No need for us to post threads already locked on our respective pages.
Please keep this order, folks.

B. I have a problem with the fact that it's a "bundle of adventures" for the switch, it's not a game you need to play once every year.

Adder: I hope they get that other new enemy type off the table - Typhoons. I'm actually not that interested in Forsaken Shores (it's boring AF) but I am curious to see what they have planned since they've shown off everything else.

~!~Days Gone - New Info & Videos (No Spoilers)

Kalentan: Days Gone is coming this week and a lot of people are interested in the game. Days Gone has not been shown very well and some fans are going to be worried. The guys behind Days Gone are planning to reveal their next game at E3 2019.
The Darksiders 3 Info Thread
The developers revealed the heroes and villains from the first game and said they were working on getting them in better order.
We'll likely get the same teaser as the first game.
The State of Things
The first game was a huge success and was constantly in the top 5 games in the US and every Top 10 worldwide on steam sales chart.
The game is going to focus on two things: exploration and stealth.
They are going to be releasing a photo mode (with maybe a different gameplay layer going forward)
They have a 3 year plan where each year they will focus on 2 things: story and gameplay. They are going to talk more about story at E3 2019 and at least 1 secret at E3 2019.
They have been told that they are going to focus more on gameplay updates this year and that they are going to continue experimenting with things like a story focused mode and a stealth focused mode.
They have been told that at their next dev conference they will talk about things like more respawns, cross-platform play between Pro and X, and if there is a new set of characters in the game.
The two things that are going to be at the forefront of their next game are: Price and the release date. The last one will be more in the background but they are still in the early stages of planning and the game is still in early access.
The second thing that they are going to focus on is the "we are excited to bring back the roots, we loved the last few, but it's time to let these roots go"
They did say that they were looking for a reason for delay. They like to have a showing in-game at E3 and they like to have a few people from games to talk about.
The PS4 Pro Details Thread
The developer has been told that they are going to announce the specs for Days Gone at E3 next week and release them as a pre-order bonus for the PS5.
The idea is for them to have some friends from publishers and developers to help them work

====================
~!~Do you think there's a chance that a game will come out after a certain date?

Prologue: Announced at GDC.
My question is, what's the likelihood of a game coming out this year.
Destiny 2 is apparently next year.
What do you guys think?
-----
Rodjer: Destiny 2 is coming next year, it seems like a great fit for the franchise and the studio.
-----
Crossing Eden: Ill take a year.
-----
John Kowalski: I mean, Destiny 2 is coming out next year, Bungie really doesn't want to drop support for the game.
-----
bitSS: I think it's very possible that there's a delay before the end of next year. I think it's one of those "if the delay hits, we'll do it on the next thing" things. I think it could be something like the "Fall 2018 update" for Destiny 4, but delayed or delayed so that it's not a big deal for the release of the game itself.
-----
mescalineeyes: we already have this thread.
-----
KoolAid: The delay would push the story forward with a small bonus.
-----
Knight613: Destiny 2 Remaster is probably next year.
-----
Kater: I'm thinking it'll come out next year, unless Bungie decides to not support this game for months. They'd want to capitalize on the positive reception, and Bungie would be a better fit than no.
-----
Strakt: Destiny 2 Remaster is not happening..

~!~EA Access (free with Twitch Prime)

TheJackdog: so it's been on my wishlist for a while.
I think it's just a short "EA Access" of a game you can play with EA Access users.
So that's interesting

Nintendo: Thanks for the heads up. Downloading now.
-----
TheJackdog: for some reason I thought it was for anthem, but that was the name of the game

Xx 720: Thanks for the heads up op. Downloading now

~!~Why hasn’t Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 been getting a Battle Royale mode?

Phantom Thief: So, I think it’s clear to anyone who has a vested interest in the Call of Duty franchise that Battle Royale will not be the norm. I’d love a Battle Royale mode for Black Ops 4. It would help set the tone for a whole new set of options in multiplayer that Battle Royale doesn’t have.
I just don’t understand why this is a thing. Maybe because it wouldn’t play like PUBG? Maybe it’s just nostalgia washing over it? Either way, I really don’t get why it’s a thing. I feel like I’m missing out on a lot more than I should for the game to be as successful as it is.
What do you all think? Has Activision just sold out? Has Battle Royale just become a buzzword for everything wrong with the industry?
-----
Zappy: I doubt it, the people that are going to be playing it are the same people that will like it.
-----
ZhugeEX: If they're also going to have it as the main attraction then they'll do it the best way they can.

~!~The Next DEATH BATTLE: "KILL THE THAMES" (UNIS) - Director/Producer/Writer/Actuator/Partner

Dancrane212: The Next DEATH BATTLE pits the titular Dirty Player against the notorious Blackone, Necrozma. Once the story begins with two titentially Atlanta inspired cities and the world’s first bounty hunting mafia’s’ special sauce, the story will beeline across the UGA studio logo, a self-explanatory office address for the studio’s offices, a logo that ranks among the company’s trademarks, and a brand-new source of iconic imagery. Based upon an initially promising start for a first-in-the-genre PlayStation exclusive debut, the movie will be directed by Josh Appelbaum, a longtime producer who has gone off script to feature his own project in an original film format.
"The next DEATH BATTLE will definitely set a new trend in entertainment, so we are incredibly excited to share it with you soon," said Acting Lead Writer, Josh Appelbaum. "We’re excited to have been given the platform by Sony to pursue a new kickass adventure, and we look forward to the great story. We’re also incredibly grateful that the DEATH BATTLE takes us out into a beautiful city and a beautiful city… and it really does feel like you’re playing a videogame." 
A game designer who has seen film and game as a formative experience, Josh Appelbaum continues, "We have been very fortunate to be able to work with Ninja Theory and Sony." 
"The DEATH BATTLE is also an original kickstarter run by the talented Vidya Nadeshot of Slant fame, so it looks like the movie is directly inspired by the video game company. "
-----
Dancrane212: Yeah, I posted this up in my OP yesterday, because this movie seems to be getting bumped all the time here. The Founder of the studio is currently working on Hitman 2 (huh, the movie's name).

~!~What Pokémon will be a post release DLC in Smash Ultimate in terms of content?

Waluigilicious: I know I’m going to say Pokémon, Pikachu and Animal Crossing but I really think Smash DLC will be a post-launch DLC. Similar to Dragon Quest DLC that’s what, basically DLC you wait a few months to launch a game and then decide on what to do with it.
With Pokémon there is the same basic framework that we see with DLC and with Pokémon Let’s Go DLC Pokémon and Pokémon Let’s go, the base game will be a cross-over DLC game between the main games.
With Pokemon, they will have the same basic framework as Smash but they will focus on new, unique Pokémon and will release them on a Post launch DLC schedule.
With Pokémon, there is the same basic framework as DLC Pokémon and Pokémon Let’s go, except they will focus on new, unique Pokémon and will release them on a Post launch DLC schedule.
With Pokemon, there is the same basic framework as DLC Pokémon and Pokémon Let’s go, except they will focus on new, unique Pokémon and will release them on a Post launch DLC schedule.
What is your stance on this?
-----
Mr-Joker: They are gonna charge you for the DLC you already have anyway.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: They'll do DLC for you for free by making you wait for the full game.
-----
Deleted member 46641: I mean, I don't think they really need to charge you for DLC if the game itself is already a complete, fully-fledged game.
-----
Waluigilicious: I agree with you, I just think they are gonna charge you for the DLC you already have. 
I have not played Let's Go but I know for sure they aren't gonna charge you for the base game itself.
-----
RochHoch: They'll charge you for the DLC you already have. 
I don't think that's a good thing or anything that would affect how Let's Go sells.
-----
KtotheRoc: They can charge you for DLC if you already own the base game, but they can't charge you for the DLCs you already own.
-----
Sega Dreamcast: DLC? DLC? Oh boy...
-----
tiebreaker: They won't charge you for DLC

~!~The Red Lantern Corps is not a regular game but it's also a survival game

dex3108: I am not talking about some dark souls like situation but this game is not a regular game or even survival game. 
First of all let me say that I am not a casual player. In this game you need to learn mechanics and not risk dying and try to be OP. You need to be a good player and in this game you are the only survivor. The game is not telling you to survive and I mean that in a lot of ways. 
You can't just become OP by being good and scarce. You need to be creative and not rely on other players to help you. The way the game works it is to develop a city. You work for the purpose to build a village. You need to be patient and not be afraid of other people helping you, you need to be smart to not be a complete dick when it comes to trees and people. 
The game encourages you to play with other people or with randoms. It is not a survival game but it is a survival game where you need to become good at the game to survive. You need to learn things that other players wont be able to do because they can't see your vision. 
The real meat of the game is the combat system. You can train your character to be any type of character and every time you pick one of those options you get another one of those quests for you. 
You can fight in any order and have up to three characters in each hand and it is a lot of freedom. You can crossbow, melee, magic and you can switch between characters up to four depending on the situation. You can hang out with the other characters and the inventory you have while the other characters are exploring the city. 
The game is not telling you to play your cards and not rely on others. You can still do whatever you want, you have to choose the path for you, but you can always have more things to do while other players are doing it. 
You can do other things like help the other members of your camp while they are exploring or by magic help the poor one while the rich one is helping the poor one. 
If you are not good at the game you have to start from the bottom one and work your way up. If you die you have to start over and work your way back to the top

~!~What Xbox Games Would You Like To See In Your Hands-On Experience?

Sibersk Esto: I know, it's a list thread.
If you have a Xbox One please feel free to move on and I understand that this is a small staff, so hectic and demanding topic, so I'm not sure how many games could fit in there that he doesn't already know of already.
With that said, I'm thinking about the following games that I feel would interest me to play at some point:
Halo 5
The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker
Halo 6
I'm also open to suggestions on games that we know would be worth a second chance, like an old-school RPG, a strategy game or something similar.
I'm just curious about the current state of gaming in this industry and what games you'd like to see in there.
Personally, I've always been a fan of the Halo series and have been interested in trying them out some times.

Theorry: Gears of War

Mazzle: Perfect Dark

2San: Gears of War

~!~Can I play Divinity: Original Sin on console?

Candescence: I've been on PS4 for a while, but since it's Xbox/PC only I've been eyeing up the recent ports and decided that I'd just roll through the life of the original Sin and give it a go.
I've heard that it's really fun, but I've never played the original. I didn't touch the sequels and feel like I should give them another chance.
I'm looking for a way to play the original on console and have the intention of playing DOS-style on my PS4. I've heard that it's fantastic and I just wanna play the tactical RPGs of the first two.
I've heard that the console versions of comics/ novels are available on psnow, and I've heard that the ps1 versions are also available via ps now. I'm open to any sort of port if it's something I'm more interested in. 
Thanks!
-----
Aeana: Yes you can.
-----
Candescence: And they're awesome.
-----
Aeana: Yeah, I'm open to that too.
-----
Candescence: yeah, the ps1 versions are available via psnow. I was going to say that I've heard that there's a PS version, but I can't remember where I got the ps1 info from.
-----
Anno: I would say that you can but it's held back by the issues with steam support.
-----
Candescence: Oh at that would be nice. Right now I've got the PC version, but I've been looking for something else to play.
-----
Anno: I don't remember it being like this in the base version.
-----
Candescence: I'll try it, but I'm a bit worried about the patch sizes. 
The patch sizes listed on SteamDB are all 50/50
-----
Candescence: I've been waiting for the PS1 patch, and I've got a ps3 version in my backlog. 
I have a ps4 and a switch.

~!~The best or worst stories of the last generation

Dreamboum: I'm not going to here a bad story about the last gen. Instead I'm going to talk about the stories behind the best or greatest of all times:
The Last of Us:
This was a time when Sony was at their peak when it comes to this momentous period. The game was in desperate need of a reboot after the third movie, while CDPR was trying to build a big story in the schoolroom. Everything was going according to plan at the time and the developer was trying to create a compelling story.
The story that hit the fan at the time was this small mission that involves the American military, a situation almost similiar to the one from the early 90's. Not only is the story amazing, but the idea of the beginning of the war is at the core of the story. The Americans were winning the armory fight on the beaches of Normandy while they prepared for the invasion. It all culminates in a pivotal moment:
The American military
The story is convoluted and has many layers, ranging from the convoluted internal politics to the convoluted wars that started the entire game. The game's treatment of war is also hampered by it's adherence to a small merry-go-round in the era of 16-bit consoles, but the combat is still pretty fun. The game was also the first to include a third playable character, and at the time it was pretty good.
The story that got a BIG BIG beat was
Spoiler
. It starts with a kid named Ash, playing a game of football, and he comes across an American scout telling the kid about his exploits. The kid realises that Ash's name Ash was dropped by the Hunk of Fushonoha, the legendary weapon in Shibuya, and Ash's mission to retrieve it is a major mission that has to do with saving the legendary weapon's bearer and Ash's friends. You play as various characters, each with their own motivations, side-by-side and with Ash.
Spoiler
By the end of the game, the four characters Ash and Ellie have become friends with is a storyline that is centred around the lives of the Hunk and other-
Spoiler
The Hunk of Fushonoha

The Hunk realises that the only thing that can save Ellie and Annie is her fear of heights. The three menorah's explosion into the surrounding

~!~Capcom Picked up XB1/PS4 for a , but they can't fit it in the box

Deleted member 1378: I was just looking for an XB1 when I saw this news.
I know it's odd, but I've been getting an X recently lately and after the recent GOW patch I'm even more excited about it. I've never played Ubi games before but Ubi tends to pick up on the XB1 exclusives and they're usually a lot of fun to play.
I'm not sure if it's the hardware or the gamepad or whatever but the lack of a pc version just means they're going to go wimpy.
Anyone else excited?
-----

====================
~!~Dangerous Driving coming to Xbox Game Preview on May 15 (Slower and with new content)

Dancrane212: Also coming to Game Preview is a new Dangerously Driving game mode that's free and preorderable at [email protected]
The game mode is pretty fun but there's a lot of potential in the engine setup that could be improved.
-----
Maneil99: Great game. Imo better optimized than the first Dangerous Driving. I hope they get to make more aggressive/silly sections.
-----
Maneil99: They should take this concept from Dangerous Driving to a safer Crew mode. Crews are just too dull to work well in a racing game.

~!~Best and worst music in the last 10 years

Phediuk: This is not a thread to bash or have fun, no matter how you feel. This is not a thread to bash people with a terrible opinion about the music in the last 10 years. This is not a thread to bash and have fun, no matter how you feel.
This is not a thread to bash and have fun, no matter how you feel.
Like me, I'm a big fan of the music in games and movies. I'm also big fan of the colors, atmospheres, and motifs in the games.
However, I was surprised to learn that 91% of all music is from video games.
This is absolutely, overwhelmingly skewed.
What are some of the best and most iconic soundtracks in games?

Usyren: Dearly Beloved. Still the best OST in a videogame.

~!~The Best Video Games of 2018 - From Japanese developers to the most expensive DLCs, every game is a budget-defusting $60

LifeLine: AAA games that aren’t that much expensive are still selling well and it feels like AAA developers aren’t shy about dipping their toes into the latest and greatest.
For example, RE2 Remake announced that the team behind the series is working on a motion-capture tech game based on the first episode of Resident Evil 2. While it’s revealed that the full release for the game will be at E3, the company says that it will be free for everyone, but only ones who have a PlayStation Plus level credit will be able to download the game. 
As more and more major games show their support for this $60-$100 system, it’s a great time to be a gamer.
What do you think?
-----
FluxWaveZ: God of War was $59.99 last week. That's a damn good price.
-----
JammerLammy: That's a damn good deal
-----
Derachi: I’ll be purchasing every RE2 release.
-----
Loudninja: Lol
-----
DriftingSpirit: Damn.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I think the most important part of this is that they will at least have a way to go to market and not compete against the major publishers. Capcom and From Software are definitely not that publisher.
-----
JammerLammy: I guess it's worth $20?
-----
Deleted member 15538: Sounds about the same as buying RE7 and DMC5 for $60.

Puffy: Damn.

Now I have everything.
Again, I don't have a PS4 or PC. I don't have a Switch. I have everything.
I know its some kind of thing but how much of a thing do these things have?
-----
AxeVince: Yes, they do.
-----
LewieP: Not really, I mean, most of the time you don't play many games on any system. Just depends on what game interests you the most.
-----
Renna Hazel: They don't. They should, if you're interested in the games, you're more likely to get them on there.
-----
Mike Rambo: that’s what I said. I’m not one to buy games day one, I just bought them day one
-----
jviggy43: Yes, everything should be there day one.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I have a fairly high baseline PS4 and a good PC, but I don't think I'll ever buy a game on that platform again.
-----
Doom_Bringer: Yes, if you like video games and have enough spare time to play them

Kaz Mk II: I don't care about console games. I just like to have all my games in perfect order.

~!~What are the best Metroidvania games?

VanCityGamer: I thought I'd take a trip down memory lane of some great games in the past few years, but the truth is... I haven't played them all yet and I haven't played 'em all. With this in mind, what are the best Metroidvania games that aren't held back by the platform or difficulty? I'm looking for some ideas on how to go about Metroid-liking games that I can find in the past while having difficulty options. 
I'll start with one that I can think of.
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was my first game of this style and I love the aesthetic, but it's not really my style. I don't think the gameplay is great, but I did love the atmosphere of the game. I'm open to any kind of difficulty too. I found Crystal Chronicles to be a little punishing for that. I was about to beat the game and I was about to burn out. So I started the game and was having a blast of exploration and combat. I just beat the boss and then I went to bed. 
So I'm gonna talk about this one, gonna talk about the art direction. This game is absolutely gorgeous. I have no clue on the technical limits but it's definitely in my top 10 of the last decade. It's just so beautiful and dynamic. The music is just as catchy as ever and very nostalgic. I think the reason why it's so dynamic is because the game is really DARK. That's a big part of it. The game does a good job in giving the player a better idea of the Breach. That's why it pairs well with the art direction that is so good. 
I'm gonna talk about the music way more so I'll talk about it. It's really impressive. The music is one part of it and I'm really surprised I'm playing this game this late into the game. I'm playing it at night and my eyes roll back to my head whenever I see a horrible music. The intro to the region 2 story has got me going. 
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles is also a really good game, I found it to be more challenging than Crystal Chronicles 2 and I didn't find it to be OP at all. I've got to admit, I'm a little disappointed in this game. It was a pretty damn fine game, probably my second best game this generation behind Uncharted 4
====================
~!~Is playing a game not a requirement for PS Plus anymore?

SuperNerd3000: I usually don't buy online sub yearly but this year I'm trying to get the most out of PS Plus. I've been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for the last few days and I'm having a blast.
I've heard that PS Plus is a requirement for PS4 when it comes to online play, what do I need to do before I can get the most out of it?
-----
kennyamr: Just play the game.
If not, buy it.
-----
Rikucrafter: If you’re not interested in online play then just jump right in RDR2 and play it. It’s a lovely time.
-----
Falchion: I spent $10 to get my first PS4 and I never took advantage of the online. I can’t really afford to pay that much on the console when I like it for the SP.
-----
Loudninja: 
-----
Gravity Insanity: I think that's just for the time being.
-----
Aters: I think I've been trying to plat games, only played NFS once and Crackdown once and that was by the time of the survey. I've been playing a lot of games online.

====================
~!~So why the hell do I need a new Nier Automata?

Robinson: It's been a year, I can't remember the last time I really felt like I needed a new Nier game. It's literally January - just forget about it. I am playing it, now, for the first time in a year.
It's not the best game in the series or even the best Nier. The story is archaic. The voice acting is ass. The way the towns and cities are is ass. The music is ass. The bosses are ass. The way the story is is also ass.
And the soundtrack is god tier.
I have to do a lot of side quests and side tasks a day to earn the rest. I had to do a couple in the beginning to get the rest I wanted. But then I had to do the other side and I just couldn't do it. So...
It's like an open world RPG. I'm not saying it's bad, just kind of...complete?
-----
theotherMittens: Because Automata's story is great.
-----
jakomocha: It's too good to be true.
I like the gameplay but the world and the way it was designed is just awful. The dungeons and the towns are all full of shit. The bosses are all ass.
-----
skeezx: I remember being kind of disappointed by the third act of the game but the fourth acts gripped me enough to be a bit disappointed again. the ending to 4 really brought me in - the story, the characters, the music, the world and its themes.
well, fair enough - but at the same time it's a game that's built in the "feel" of the original game. the gameplay is solid but not perfect
-----
Brass Body Dave: I'll take a chance on the OST. You're welcome OP.
-----
skeezx: cuz I never played the original before
-----
Kamiyouni: I loved the world and atmosphere of the original game. It felt great to be in that world.
-----
UnluckyKate: I liked it somewhat, but the world was very empty, empty. I couldn't even see the place. I think I saw a little town called Badoura with a train nearby. I thought the world was amazing, but more than that,

~!~Free NES games on the eShop now in the new shop!

Tizoc: I'm still working through the list, but searching just resulted to this page, so if you haven't tried these titles, you're probably not going to like them.
I'm in the Uptown section right now, but that's because you can still get them from the eShop itself. They're free and I've seen them pop up in the past few days, but I think they'll be fine for now.
Also, if you're into VR, the selection of VR titles have been pretty diverse this time around. In terms of PSVR, the selection is pretty much all of the above.
Now, to that part of the list...
Pong (NES)
Jr.Nighty One (SNES)
Plague Road (PS1)
Straw Man (NES)
Somebody for a second (PS2)
Nintendoman: Console Edition (NES)
The Raven Remastered (SNES)
Somebody For a Round (PS2)
NintendStar Balls: Sega Edition (NES)
NintendStar Balls: Sega Edition II (Sega Master System)
I'd recommend SNES titles if you haven't played them already, but I'm not a big fan of all the other stuff lately, as much as I love NES games.
-----
Lant_War: That's a pretty good list. Which ones are free yet? 
Might check out the free ones though.
-----
trugs26: I keep hearing this, but if you mean SNES that's the whole list.
-----
Tizoc: I think i've played some of the free stuff.
-----
trugs26: I've been wanting to play some of these as well. I should really get back to my WiiU virtual console collection.
-----
ShadowFox08: I'm sad I've played some of these and still haven't gotten to playing them
-----
Tizoc: Oh yeah I forgot this list was free.
-----
Tron1: Are you from the US?
-----
trugs26: No, just check out the free ones from the eShop.
-----
Tron1: I’m from the US.

====================
~!~So I just platinumed Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Which of the following games do you think it has the most 'hacks-of-entremitability' and most 'hacks-of-enchantment'?

Phendrift: It’s really hard for me to pick a single game to say. Especially when the rest of the thread premise is in order.
Sekiro is a mechanically fantastic looking, open world ninja game, and it’s a MUST for fans of FromSoftware. The art and lore is so good, the setting, the level design, and the enemy designs, are all great. Everything about it is top notch.
But which one?
Prey.
Dark Messiah.
Demon's Souls.
Bloodborne.
Souls games.
-----
Birdseye: You're the one who said Sekiro has the best atmosphere
-----
TheRaidenPT: I voted Sekiro on the poll cause I've been replaying it just to see what everyone has been talking about and Bloodborne is my favourite of the bunch.
-----
Ferrs: Bloodborne, atmosphere and atmosphere. I don't care if it's "better" atmosphere.
-----
Phendrift: Nah, I beat the game in about a week lol.
-----
NotLiquid: You can't really compare the three to one and not even close. Sekiro is clearly the better game and does so much differently, but Bloodborne has some great atmosphere that I find really helps it stay fresh, more so than Sekiro.
-----
Lant_War: I think Sekiro has the best atmosphere and atmosphere. It's my favorite game of all time and even better because it's the only one I've ever beaten.
-----
Raijinto: That's a good answer actually, thanks for the link.
-----
Vela: The atmosphere is evoked in my mind a lot. It’s one of the reasons I appreciate From more. You’re right that Sekiro has that greater sense of isolation and sense of being connected. I feel like From made a lot of incredible strides in the lore and character of Bloodborne.

====================
~!~What are the best level themes in gaming?

Masterspeed: I love the themes in Mario Party, Mario Kart, and Mario Tennis. Some of my favorites are Mario Party, Mario Kart, Mario Tennis, and Mario Tennis.
I'm playing Mario Party and it's a good theme, but Mario Tennis is a bad theme. I don't know why, but the music in that game fit the character of Bowser, the villain of Bowser, and the villainous Peach, and a good theme is in Mario Kart and Mario Tennis.
I know it was inspired by a specific Theme Campaign, but if that's the best then I'll play the rest.
-----
TheCongressman: The one that really got me was....
The one with the Maiden in Black song.
-----

SolVanderlyn: I remember the first level, which was Mario's and Luigi's unreachable dream of his being able to help them in impossible circumstances.
The second level has Yooka Layle take over the world, and it's pretty great.
-----
TheCongressman: I should say I haven't played that one but it did get me to thinking about level themes. It's quite a shame the first level theme, in a galaxy far away, doesn't have one.
-----
Masterspeed: I'm pretty sure that's the theme in Bowser's Castle in the game, but I haven't played that.
It's great, but it's not the best.
-----
Nights: I'm not sure I like the second level's theme, given that it's just the opening song for the game and the first song is the boss battle.
-----
SolVanderlyn: I can't remember the first level... But, in the game's opening area, you're given a letter by Bowser telling you that his son's army is preparing to come and is planning to take control of it. This is the opening song for the game.
The second level's theme is a remix of the first level's, but not the first level's.
-----
TheCongressman: Oh, man. I remember hearing about that when I was a kid. I know it's not the best or whatever, but it's what it is.

~!~Marvel's Spider-Man Spoiler Thread

Jawmuncher: The title is pretty much self explanatory. I'll get the links and impressions here. 
So far there's been 4 threads about the game so far with 4+ of those being just the specific aspects. The other two I'll get to shortly. 
In Progress

Spider-Man: The New Web of Comics by Eric Wormore
Preview and preview our new comics here: 
I've been following this game for a little while. It was on sale a few weeks ago for $3.99. I think I've seen a lot of praise for this game and I think I won't have to wait long to get my hands on it. But I've just started playing and it's been going on for a few weeks now. I'll be updating the spoiler thread as we go along.
So far, the most notable thing has been the swinging. I did a few quick acrobatics and some web swinging with Plus and it was pretty satisfying. But traversing the city and trying to get to a new city in Manhattan swinging your way to several different buildings is a little difficult. Even with the webline, it's still very difficult. It's not like Spider-Man has any traversal options and you can still teleport freely. I think this map is mostly just for shows as other traversal systems come together to create the best swinging system in any video game ever. But I do wish there was more to explore that would be a lot more satisfying.
The new gadgets seem to be being rolled out particularly. Vibes are now properly a thing. The Enhanced Spider Mode and Enhanced Spider Mode are now much more available than before. Vibations now only get up to a short range to cast a web or run away from Vibises. There's also a new web swing ability. Vibities are shaken, and they're unlocked up to a point. Spidey has not been able to use the web arc ability in a long time.
The game's interface feels a lot smoother. I feel like Spidey has a better flow than what we saw before. I like the new web arc ability and how different it is. The Webline ability is useful to a point to make sure you're not mind-numbing. The Web arc ability is usable on Spider-Man

~!~What is the best way to experience Hollow Knight?

dock: I've heard there's a ton of people who are enjoying it but don't have the time to devote to it. I've tried playing it more, but I don't feel like I'm ready for the best. 
The demo seems pretty interesting, but I've yet to complete it. 
I heard it's very difficult? Is that the only way to complete the game? 
I've heard that Hollow Knight doesn't really tell you what its really important to know before you start. Is that wrong? Is it too long? How long is it? Why did I have to play it? 
I like to play games I've experienced first hand, and am interested in, but this game is something I've been playing for so long and have yet to fully experience.
-----
Theswweet: It's a great game. Stick with it, it's a great game.
-----
TheMoon: It's a very broad series, there are many styles of game, and there's very little bad stuff, so don't get too caught up in the hate.
-----
FairyEmpire: Hollow Knight is a good, broad series that you shouldn't feel too overwhelmed by the best of the best. If you care about the story at all, start with HK/BotW and work your way up. The aesthetic and the gameplay are both simple, simple games, and really really nothing really meaningful in them.
-----
Brawly Likes to Brawl: I've never played Hollow Knight but am planning on doing so before the new DLC hits. I stopped following HK after the first DLC hit, but I haven't really touched it since that time.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: I played it when they released and I liked it a lot but I could not enjoy it enough to complete it. I found the game itself rather dull and boring. I am not a deep expert on the game but I remember how they decided to make the world, the secrets, and the dungeons. I found the game to be a very hard game to go through but it was a joy to explore after I beat the first DLC.
-----
mindsale: I really enjoyed it. It's a game that's hard and super naff, but when you get to the end, it's a joy to replay.

~!~I think I am ready for the next gen to go back to the generic power A/B design for power A/B

SilverX: So, I have been playing some games with (or almost immediately starting) the new power A A/B design, over the last few years, especially the last one. I remember that the A/B design for PS4/Xbox One used to be quite good, yet the design for Switch was just plain ugly in almost every way and relegated to a nostalgia gimmick.
I am not the biggest fan of the new power A design, I have done plenty of portable play and have even played games with power A A as the power A controller. But I know that it is not as good, and that is probably the main reason why I am so torn up about it.
I have been playing games for a while with the new design and I think it is time for me to give it another shot. I don't think it needs to be so fancy like the PS4 one, but I think it is fairly nice to be able to use the A/B layout for a lot of different things.
I think it is time for me to go back to the power A/B design, and the Switch is perfect for that.
-----
TheMink: I’d be fine with that.
-----
Jaded Alyx: You're not the first person to do this.
-----
Gonzalez: Eh, I prefer the PS4 power A/B design.
-----
Hero: Yeah, I'm not even sure you can use the Switch A/B layout in portable mode.
-----
Mr. Phellps: I think I prefer them over the regular power A/B design, but I don't think I like the power A design much.
-----
BRSxIgnition: I'm not sure I like the power A design, but I think I prefer the power B layout.
-----
KratosEnergyDrink: I think the power B layout is the best. However, it is not as comfortable to use with a power A controller.
-----
BriGuy: I hate both. Both have their place in the controller. Power A is better, but A over B is just plain ugly.
-----
Lazlo: I think the Switch A layout is the best. I like power A more but power B is

~!~How to get the most out of my Xbox 360-compatible Samsung TV - The Ultimate Reality TV

Daffy Duck: So I’ve been looking for an interesting deal.
I’ve got a 4K TV and I want to be able to use my Xbox 360 compatible TV with it.
I’ve got 2 question:
1. Is the TV too small for my needs?
2. How do you feel when playing with the controller in the bedroom?
I have intended to play with a Samsung TV for a long time but I’ve always had issues with the TV.
I don’t know what the deal with this is, anyone know?

Xiofire: I don't think there's any way to get it to accept any HDMI signal.

The Real Napsta: Yeah, it can't do 4K

Patitoloco: It was all about the writing. I recommend reading it if so.

FoneBone: I'm interested to see more about this "souls games" trend.
-----
Atolm: Well, this is a good read. I never read the books in high school and I know very little about Egypt, but it's interesting to see how much people like it.
-----
Deleted member 43077: I love it.
-----
Blackleg-sanji1: I’d love to see odyssey gameplay
-----
Blackleg-sanji1: I mean they made the game in no rush they just needed some time to polish the ball and nailed it.
-----
Ahasverus: I love the writing in the Egypt storyline.

Z-oo31: This is the best "what's next" prequels.

GeoNeo: I liked the writing in Odyssey.

~!~LTTP: Shadow of the Tomb Raider (spoilers up to 4/2 in 4/3)

Fahdi: I'm about a week behind on finishing this game, but I gotta say I've been enjoying it so far.
The atmosphere, the graphics, the story, everything. I mean, it's a film (that doesn't necessarily mean it's movies). It's not a film in and of itself, it's just something I've been enjoying more the past few days. The film approach is so cool, the art style, the narrative, the direction, and it's so diverse. I'm just amazed at how good the game is in so many ways.
All of these aspects combined together make for a very good experience. The game is great in many ways, but the execution is just so so so frustrating. The game is a lot more difficult than I expected, but the best way to finish it was executing it so flawlessly.
I love this game so goddamn much. I'm not sure why I like it as much, it's too much film-esque movie like too, but it's just so fun to play. The movie approach is just so perfect, I just love it so much. I really want to see more, but even the more on-point sections are so much better than the on-foot sections.
-----
mescalineeyes: Shadow of the Tomb Raider is a classic. And a good one at that.
-----
Chivalry: It's my favorite in the trilogy.
-----
Wace: It's a boring, cocky, and dumb movie with a lass woman as main character.
-----
Fantastical: It's good, but it's just too much film. I'll definitely give it a chance, but the execution is so frustrating it's not even funny.
-----
Claven: It's a great, if very mediocre movie, and I wouldn't recommend it for the "best" movie quality. 
Good movie, if you want to see it at that quality, check out The London Spy, and also the amazing original 1979 book, Inside the Tower: The Rise and Fall of the Empire.
-----
No Depth: I am currently watching the movie and can see the potential for this game.
I can see how it could work as a big disappointment for many but that was not the movie experience I was expecting.

~!~The Silver Case/Serial Cleaner - Another cool looking detective game

BadWolf: Hey everyone,
I have the first game released today on Steam. It's a Q3 2018 game.
It's a Q1 2018 QQ2 game (it's coming out this week) that's about the small town/village/college life of Silver Case. The game is a slice/subscribed adventure game with a twist/puzzle element.
It's about a 15-16 hour game. The game has a Metacritic score of 85 (For those interested) and is published by NIS.
Leaked information from the Steam page/release date is from Q2 2018.
Spoiler
It's available on Early Access / Private Beta / The Early Batch.
Some tidbits:
Go to the subreddit: r/xboxone
There's also a mod that converted the title to 'The Silver Case' /'salquel/ that I've merged into the main subreddit called 
Also, a lot of the new cutscenes look like they were done by the original game. They're not that immersive / resembles the original game.
Also, here's some new gameplay:
-----
TheMoon: edit: goddammit.
-----
alr1ght: Wow, the thread title is just a terrible copy-paste now.
-----
Bandage: I don't know if I can ever play this game.

theChocobo: I loved the original. The Silver Case was a magical game.

Strings: I know it's technically a remake, but still :/

Kain-Nosgoth: i played the other cases and it was cool, but the twist and puzzle aspects were so bad it made me laugh every time i would look

TheMoon: it's a remake? god damn.
also, the twist was really good!

Twonny: I love the original

~!~The Crew 2 - who is the best at single player fps(and crazy stuff)

dex3108: Been playing this game for 5 years now and I am still amazed at how good it is. You need to work at racing games and there are tons of them. And the production values and graphics are insane. The game is also very hardcore as well and it is well optimized.
What do you think about this?
-----
bigbluefrontend: I enjoyed it. Graphics are looking great and the most recent update supposedly fixed some crazy shots.
-----
Anno: It’s a fun game, but the Crew 2 is a more refined and polished experience. I’d say that’s the best racer on the market.
-----
Bansai: The Crew 2 is the best racer I've ever played, so yes.
-----
hughesta: I never played it, but I really loved the Crew Cars, and I really hope the new one looks fun too.
-----
Bony Manifesto: Yeah, it's fun and really well optimized. It's got a lot of heart and charm despite that. The Crew 2 is a lot more competitive in terms of production values than any of the Crew entries, and I personally think it's probably one of the most aesthetically attractive open-world racers out there right now.
-----
WillySJ3: It's a fun game. I have high hopes for the next Crew game and it's shaping up to be an excellent racer next year.
-----
Ebullientprism: Gameplay wise it's like really mediocre. 
But open world racers are usually designed to be open world racers. It's just not the best looking racer in print imo.
-----
TJ_Electronica: I really liked the Crew 2 and I don't see myself buying it again. I'll probably skip it, but I sure as hell prefer it to the Crew 1.
-----
HueyFreeman: I loved the Crew 2, gave it a go, but the Crew 1 is still the best racer on the market today and the Crew 2 is a lot more fun to play than the first.

~!~The best ethical examples of good design?

Nappael: With the imminent release of Metroid Prime 4, I think it is time to bring this up. Metroid Prime 4 is highly regarded as one of the best games of all time, and will probably be one of the best-rated upcoming games ever. While it does have some questionable design choices and decisions, I think it is undeniable that Metroid Prime would be one of the most successful games of this generation.
So, let's look at what I think a good game designer should do in this era of transition from making little blunders like Prime 2, 3, and Prime Hunters.
I will start with some examples:
Project Re Fantasy:
This game was apparently rushed to the point of having to go through heavy use of HUDs and audio logs and you can disable all of it just to look like an actual good game. It also has one of the most beautiful and atmospheric soundtracks ever seen in any Metroid game. While I think the game is pretty amazing technically, it's one of the few that is possible to use music for its gameplay, and I think it's possible to use audio logs to properly convey the feelings the game has, possibly imparting some personality.
Project Re Fantasy had a very troubled development, mainly due to the nature of the game, which was first made in 1996, and then completely abandoned in 2004, due to the project's failure. It should be said that the developers eventually got a good portion of the development time to the point that they could have recouped the development of another original Metroid game in the same style, but alas, it never saw the light of day.
Another good example is The Witcher 3. It was originally an open world RPG, but it was completely abandoned in 2007 due to the project's failure. The studio has the blessing of CD Projekt, and now has the license to make Metroid games.
Any other good examples?
-----
TheMoon: and not
-----

DocSeuss: I think the only good thing to call it is "ethical"
-----
Phendrift: I think the term you’re talking about is pretty broad.
In my view, a game designer has no idea how the gameplay loop plays into their design. You would need to design everything and then it’s mechanically adhered to.
-----
Aters: "Bioethics" doesn't really

Oheao: I have to admit that I wanted to get the pants down. They're so good.

Iyagovos: I'll admit, I really wish I could see this game.

CGiRanger: I think there's a thread for this already?

SweetSark: I do not know the topic.

I should clarify the topic.

~!~What are some home/office environments you would like to see in games?

Goldenroad: My family is in a very big house in the region of 50 at the South. My kids (7) go to the master's, master in. We get the master and his family table every once in a while. We do not arrive till we get in the master's room. We do not see any workmen at the master's room. In the master's table there is a black stack of boxes with an empty view. We go to the master's room for a few hours each. I remember working at my company at the master's and I had a lot of fun doing office stuff as a hobby. The one I had fun working on was making a game called "Heaven's Legacy". I watched my colleagues die and I had to help them! The game was about a guy trying to reach heaven's domain by going down the shitshow of the land. It had a couple of bosses and a couple of races, but it was great for them. I think it was about a guy trying to kill the pope, but before he could kill them all. I liked the game, but I remember thinking how cool it would have been if there was a papal assassin who ran the company and hired all the staff back to serve the mission. So I started thinking a bit about building a team of people who would be able to help the president. I started to notice a trend with some games. Sometimes it is to sports, other times it is to protect studios. They had better specs for security and different threat actors. They were also wondering if the enemy they were supposed to be protecting was even an enemy to their team.
So I went to my cousin's place and found the same situation. They had a really good PC and I decided to save money by going to their place and see if my PC could run the game. I didn't have a lot of money so I went to his place and bought some security first and secured it with a heavy security. I asked my cousin how it worked. The hall and he said its fine. I asked if it was a game and he said it was. I thought for sure it was . After I finished the mission, I had to escort the mission and he had a feeling it was. So I had to wait a little and he had a feeling it was. And then it happened.

~!~What PC Games do you Use Monitor and Console for?

TheGhost: So I got a new PC recently, and I was wondering if there are any PC games or programs I use for their best performance with a monitor and a console.
I was interested in a bit before I decided to spend the money on this up to ceece. I’m currently looking at some games that I’m not sure if I should go to the RTX 2080 or RTX 2080Ti.
I just don’t know which to use, and the vast majority of these are 30 fps and below.
I’m using Premiere and Varn it’s pretty good and I’m wondering if I should go for that 4K or Ultra HD ROTR.
I’m mainly looking for games that can run in 60.
Any recommendations?
-----
NSA: I don't have a 4k TV.
-----
Duxxy: I use my laptop for editing and streaming stuff.
-----
HussiZooT: I use my laptop for the sound, graphics, and network stuff.
-----
Hektor: For TAA and GFX 2012's at least, I use my desktop for everything.
-----
The Real Napsta: The vast majority of those are either 4k or 60 fps really.
-----
Kudo: I play games at 60 fps most days.
-----
Yossarian: Here's a list I found. I went with the GTX 1080 as that was the cheapest one I found.
Ryzen 7 20000 - 8GB
GTX 1060 3GB
8GB RAM
Preloaded media: I used my desktop as a base and it was perfectly fine for 4K/60.
I’m also looking for games that are tweaked for high resolutions.

====================
~!~Why are most of those games like Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy missing the point?

mogster7777: they are different from Uncharted 4. They are very similar to Uncharted. They are very similar to Uncharted. But I just want to know why.
I am playing them both on PS4. I am playing Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy. The game looks very similar to Uncharted 4 but in a big way. The level design is similar to Uncharted 4. The setting is very similar to Uncharted 4. The game takes place in a futuristic cyber-realistic world similar to Lost Legacy. The PS4 version is 1080p. The game just looks a lot better. The controls are a bit clunky. The game is a bit on the simple side. The game really shouldn't have been that much better. The game just wasn't a good Uncharted. It was a step back from Uncharted 2. But I am still happy about that. I am just playing the game again after I finished. I am playing Uncharted 2 again. I have played the Uncharted games too many times already and I just love them. They were good when they were new and they just evolved the formula.
Then there is the problem I am facing. The game is not very good in my opinion. It is a shame because I really enjoyed it when it first released. I like the Uncharted formula and gameplay is fun. But it just wasn't a good Uncharted game. I feel like the game wasn't advertised with the best marketing. It just didn't set the best standards for what a good Uncharted game should look like. Even the visuals aren't on point.
Then there is the music. I mean you have this open world action game and I love it. But the first time I tried to play it I didn't feel like I was exploring. It didn't feel like a game. It felt like a giant drawing game with Uncharted mechanics. The music was from a previous game and wasn't even released. Yet here I am playing it and the first time I started to play it felt like playing an adventure game. The world looked incredible. The setting is amazing. The visuals are great. The side quests are well done as well. The combat is fun. I could go on and on. I just love it. I don't know why I haven't played the Uncharted games. I think now I'm thinking they were made for the audience which is why they didn't sell well

~!~Why the Nintendo Switch Online Service Doesn't Work for Certain Regions

NoName999: I'm a South Asian I buy my Switch from Amazon. I live in South Asia and it is the only region that I'm buying games from. I understand that not everyone buys new products from Amazon but I understand that for certain I have to contact them about it. The fact that Nintendo is forcing the US eshop to use the european version of the Nintendo Online Service is really baffling to me.
The EU eshop sells digital goods, a digital product, but in reality, its only showing stock for a minimum of 60€ a month.
So what is the reason why the Nintendo Switch Online Service is not working for South Asians?
-----
Joseki: Why is there no US eshop on the service for other regions?
-----
NoName999: I'm from South Asia.
I buy my Switch from Amazon. I understand that not everyone buys new products from Amazon but I understand that for certain I have to contact them about it. The fact that Nintendo is forcing the US eshop to use the european version of the Nintendo Online Service is really baffling to me.
-----
Joseki: Yeah, the region locks you can't buy from any region from the US, it's not just for certain regions, but all between or between multiple regions.
-----
Dyle: It's a US eshop, at least for the most part. I always buy from my local store, that way I know which regions are the only purchasers who have to buy from.
-----
NoName999: I live in South America. I buy my Switch from the US eshop.
I live in Canada. I can buy from the Canadian eshop.
I understand this is not the best service, but I can understand the cost.
-----
Aters: No it's not working for me, Amazon is a unreliable company.
-----
Vire: I have no idea why they are not licensers for the US. I'm not a consumer, its not my job. They can do whatever. No one forcing you doesn't at least know what to do. The same companies that do not work for you have their own company to work for. I'm sure that Nintendo has their own company to work for.

~!~I’m playing Mass Effect: Andromeda and...

Firestorm: I love the series but I recently just completed Andromeda and played a lot of other games. I was wondering what Era’s thoughts are on this.
I like the idea of a space combat/stealth game with the mechanical suits but I don’t really like the idea of using the inside mechanics of your ship to progress. It feels like you’re just blasting through enemies and taking apart planets and solar systems etc. I love the awesome industrial feel of the first 2 Mass Effect games but I’m wondering if it can end up being a better experience.
-----
Theorry: Mass Effect is my favourite series and I would love to see more. But it doesnt have a good level or progression system compared to other games. So maybe i would like more of the 'legendary' games like Mass Effect.
-----
Arttemis: I think it's a great series, but the progression system is super buggy, the planets are super closed, the game is incredibly light on content, and the main villain is a killing (even in the original ME1 world). I prefer having to do sidequests and do missions to get a sense of progression, but it's not a perfect system (I've only played 2 and 3, but feels like they're the best in the series).
-----
Wulfric: I think it's a great series, but it's a far cry from the likes of ME1/2/3.
-----
ArjanN: It's decent but the "arc" is kind of the best part about Mass Effect. The story missions are kind of silly and don't really feel like they have to be engaging.
-----
Wulfric: I think I'd simply say it's the best way to play the series, especially in light of 3 and 4.
-----
Count of Monte Sawed-Off: It's a fantastic series. I'll give you a solid argument to buy it at some point.
-----
xrnzaaas: I haven't played any of the first three, but 1, 2 and 3 are still better than the first two easily.
-----
Theorry: I mean in the first case they are really bad by design. It's like they wanted to tell a good story. But the enemies are bad and need to be stopped by stealth.
====================
~!~What's the best way to play the first Witcher games on PS3?

dawgparty: I've been playing the series for the last few years and it's hard to believe it's all been happening in just over a decade. I'm talking about just about all the time I've been spending playing the games.
I'd be curious as to what version of the PS3 version of the game you'd use. I have the original release of the games and the recent expansion release, so I'm thinking I'd like to play those on the best version of the game with the latest expansion. I have a PS3 and a PS4, so I'm not even sure what the best way would be to play those on the PS3, but I'm just curious as to what version of the games you can go to to get the most out of the PS3.
-----
Solid: The best way is to look it up on Steam and go from there. The expansion disc for Witcher 3 is on sale for $23 on Steam right now and the new expansion is also on sale for $30. Be warned, the expansion itself isn't very good, and it's only like 2-3 hours long.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also on sale for $23 right now, but if you're into that kind of experience then you should definitely give it a shot. It's a great game that I can honestly say it's... well, it's a Witcher game, but it's not one I'm interested in or have the time to play through the series in order to get into it, and I don't think it's as good as the titles it plays with. I think the best way to go about starting it would be to just go through Witcher 1 and then go through the rest of the series as they come out.
-----
Kyoufu: The Witcher 1 and 2 are worth picking up on Steam. I recommend doing that if you want the best version of the Witcher 1 and 2.
-----
Pascal: I recommend using Witcher 2 and Witcher 3 to start with. They are two different games, but you should be able to start both with the same Witcher items, weapons, and items. Both are super active in your head, so you should be able to pick them up from the menu or even from the little menus that appear in your starting area.

====================
~!~(Update: Ex-Ubisoft, clarifies) Ubisoft is fully publishing the new Watch_Dogs game, "about experienced game developers working on ubisoft projects."

Rodelero: This is freaking amazing.
Ubisoft just announced that they were fully publishing the new Watch_Dogs game, about experienced game developers working on ubisoft projects.
It's the first time they are publishing a Ubisoft game, so I'm really, really shocked by this news.
Ubisoft has updated their website with new information about the game, including the title.
They haven't posted anything about the game in a while, but have updated the title for now.
The new title is "About Touring Tourist." It's the first time the title has been officially revealed.
Ubisoft usually does very PR things, like talking about the game and marketing.
The game is out in less than a week, so the PR for now seems very good.
Ubisoft has updated their website with their current release fiscal year results, and now it's up.
They are very excited by this news. The game looks amazing, and I'm really hoping we see it in the summer when the game is out.
-----
Theorry: Edit: NXGamer also corrected the title.
-----
kadotsu: They're publishing in February.
-----
FRV: That was quick.
-----
KoolAid: It's coming out in February and they are only publishing in February
-----
KZXcellent: It's going to be amazing.
-----
KoolAid: That's what happens when you get a new IP, new IP spends 3 years, and the dev goes free Hunting.
-----
RichardCree: Next gen consoles are going to be so packed, I can't see them doing a single title for at least 2-3 years.
-----
hussien-11: They have made several devs with big AAA franchises.

~!~Will we see much of Detroit Become Human, The David Cage game, Cage the Elephant?

Funyarinpa: I just watched this game and was confused because it looked like a David Cage game.
I mean, it looks pretty amazing.
I was really intrigued, but I don't think it'll be a huge budget game.
Kojima's style of games have a lot of mechanical weakness and innovations.
Will we ever get a David Cage style game? Or is it just a coincidence that Detroit is the most popular game in the genre?
-----
TheMoon: We'll probably get a Cage game, for sure.
-----
Funyarinpa: It had a teaser at the end and it was pretty well done, but it did lack the longevity and depth of the Cage games.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think it'll do just fine.
-----
Silky: So.... Detroit is going to be the biggest movie property of all time man
-----
TheMoon: David and his team have done so since the hell he opened.
-----
Funyarinpa: It's also a coincidence that it was the biggest game in the genre when it was being released, Cage's games are always larger than Kojima's games.

~!~Is the Switch Pro Controller a Hori Fighting Falcon Punisher ?

Harald23: I've seen a lot of people claim that the "Fighting Falcon" in the Switch Pro Controller is a Hori Fighting Falcon Punisher, but what do you think ?

Porygon: Yes, it is
-----
Cipher Peon: Looks like the Hori Fighting Falcon™. The Switch Pro Controller is a great deal of ports and backwards compatibility.
-----
Lite_Agent: It's a Hori fighting Falcon Punisher.
-----

Harald23: No, it's Hori Fighting Falcon.
-----
Seik: I kinda wish they had a new model in the picture... they are really selling the Hori-brand again :(
I mean, I don't know if I would call it a Hori-punchline, just a straight Hori-punchline.

I think they're all Hori-brand

~!~Assassin's Creed Odyssey - Combat system vs Black Flag/BF

dex3108: I want to say that AC Odyssey has a lot of system and playstyle differences from BF. In fact, I think it is the worst combat system we have seen in the franchise so far. You can not fight enemies while moving in your line of fire. 
BF has more options for combat options and also more gadgets. You can do things like charge and rapid charge as you move and in that mode you can move in to cover a wide area. However, in ACO after you can not charge and move in to cover a specific spot. So you have to dodge, hit and throw objects. Balancing all attacks and then charge them is a lot of work. So every now and then you will have to think about what to do to charge and wait for a moment to do so. 
I am not sure if there are any other options like that that you can toggle. But I am wondering if there is a better combat system there.

~!~The best modern/famicom platformer on the SNES

ScOULaris: I've been playing a lot of Super Meat Boy thanks to the Switch port that came out a couple of days ago. It's a fantastic platformer that features top tier music, great level design, and a great sense of exploration.
But there's one game that I'm kinda lost on is The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.
I've played it a ton of back in 2014 and have played it a handful of times since 2011. I think at some point I was put into a similar condition when I first played it for the first time and it took for even trying to comprehend how the level design and pacing worked together. But over time, I've come to really love the way Twilight Princess plays.
The only thing that makes it better than Skyward Sword is the dungeon structure, which is something I think about a lot in both ZES and OoT. In both cases, the challenge comes from the puzzles to solve, the dungeons, and the puzzles themselves. By all accounts, Skyward Sword excels in this regard, but I personally prefer its exploration and level design.
But you've got a few other things to consider, like the creepy music, and the constant backtracking.
TL;DR isn't a better description of Twilight Princess than OoT or OoA?
-----
KZXcellent: The music is nice, but the dungeons themselves are too obtuse and long. The dungeons themselves are good, but I feel like the backtracking and "I'm back in my sand box!" moments are much more memorable and impactful on me than TP's dungeons.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I didn’t like any of the dungeons.
-----
Dreamboum: TP is the best modern Zelda. It has the most ingenious puzzles, the most interesting story and the most unique dungeon design and puzzles overall.
But it's really a toss-up between TP and OoT in the ranking scale.
-----
Dphex: Twilight Princess for me. It is short, but has great soundtrack, great atmosphere, and very good dungeons. Bottt is better, but i prefer its ranking system over the less fun dungeons.
-----
Redcrayon: I’m replaying TP currently and wafting ahead, and I really like it. But, the N64

~!~Will we see a single player campaign in next-gen?

Tonky: What do you think? I think it will be a huge AAA game and the next-gen consoles will be 10 years from now. So even if it happens, is it enough time for Microsoft to really start making significant head-start with this type of game? What do you think?
-----
Lant_War: If it happens, it will be a full price game.
-----
Butch: I would hope so, I don't think they'll be getting anything until mid-gen at least.
-----
bonesawisready5: I’d hope so. It’s a game that is likely to be retail and will probably be a couple millions on a new console. I think Microsoft will at least get the first game, but I doubt they just slap a campaign on top.
-----
TheIlliterati: I wouldn't be shocked if it happens this generation. The first game had a nice single player campaign.
-----
Vagabond: I doubt it, we have at least one campaign in Horizon 2. I would expect a full-priced full-priced game with a decent campaign.
-----
Cort: I think the target audience will buy the game, but I would expect a single player campaign first.
-----
Theorry: I am not sure if it will happen. The first campaign was one of the biggest highlights of last gen. But it's probably not gonna happen this gen.
-----
Neural: I expect it to be a single-player game, probably with multiplayer at least.
-----
Becks': I think they are getting the first game and the second are the most popular games. Gears 5 is likely a next-gen game.

~!~It's time for a Resident Evil Trilogy Re imagining

Jawmuncher: Thread Rules
Everything you see in the game first comes to mind (or even if it's the first time you see something new).
Submissions
Conference will be held on Thursday, January 18th at 6pm Pacific for an announcement and time slot. No one has shown up yet to answer their own question there.
Possible early Spoilers
Either way, take all concerns with a couple of questions:
1. What type of game is this? An interconnected world building game? An action game? Please don't just assume that you can't play this. This is a game that looks like it could be fun, but it's not.
2. What type of game is this? A survival horror game? An action game? Please don't just assume that you can't play this. This is a game that looks like it could be fun, but it's not.
3. How many choices of the minigame are this? 3 different choices? Four?
4. Then what, in your heart, do you want?
-----
FiXalaS: a survival horror game
-----
Courage: Is it a survival horror game?
-----
QuixoticNeutral: I've never played this. I've heard the title and thought I was going to get a survival horror game, but haven't found the genre to match it.
-----
Seven Force: I'm not even sure what the overall consensus is on this. Basically:
It's a Super Corpse Party game.
It's Mega Man X game.
It's a game where you control a demon hunting mafia that operates a dark web network of game stores.
It's a mix between a management game and a Turn Based RTS.
It's based on Resident Evils universe and is set in the future where the Umbrella Corps exist and rule the world.
It's basically my ideal of a mix between a mix of both.
-----
SofNascimento: I have never played this. It's weird how I'm convinced this game will be the next BioShock.
-----
SofNascimento: I've heard the game is different compared to the first one, I think it's more of a mix between Resident Evil and Call of Duty.

~!~What's your one wish that will make Nintendo 3rd party change their 3rd party support?

Neoxon: Not too long ago, Nintendo teased their plans on a "major announcement." This announcement happened during their Treehouse stream. Here's some stuff from the stream. A few things that caught my eye:
Nintendo will likely change their online offerings with a beefier online service overhaul.
Atelier games will be on Nintendo Online, while at first offering only the "best" version of the game.
The ability to play 3rd party games will go from a paid option, to a "buy on online!" option.
The ability to use the cloud saves feature of Nintendo's online service to back up your saves locally.
Third party games will appeal to fans that feel they are missing out on certain third party games that are exclusive to Nintendo Online.
I'd like to hear what you guys wished for in this day and age!

Satonaka: I hope they don't fuck this up.
-----
IceDoesntHelp: It's fucking up already.

Drain You: I hope they don't fuck this up.

Tagyhag: I'm in for this.
I'm skeptical of how I would run it.
I would think it would have to be PCs that could handle 4K at 30fps at a relatively low price.
-----
DangerMouse: Yeah, but they're using a much more powerful CPU!
-----
DangerMouse: Yeah, and it's a 1080p45. I'll have to go with a 1440p G-Sync monitor.

What are some of the examples of games that have the exact same controls as the rest of the game?

Cess007: The Evil Within. Reminds me of Silent Hill.

WiZaRdOuS: The Evil Within... but first of all I don't think RE7 works that well

Mauricio_Magus: Castlevania Lords of Shadow on the DS.
I can't stand this one.

TheFallenSaboteur: I thought the controls were weird.

Mass Effect: Resident Evil. I mean, it's not bad, but if it's not your cup of tea then sure.
-----
Myradeer: The Evil Within.
At least you can play it at 120fps if you don't mind motion controls.

TheFallenSaboteur: I know. I tried the demo and the game looks just as bad to me - you know how most reviews are, and this one also by Ben Kuchera with a 4.5/5.

~!~Nomura on KH3's difficulty: "You all fucked up"

Kaitos: It seems that Nomura is very fond of making up excuses.
In Kingdom Hearts 3, the player can choose to go through the story of the game with no difficulty. Nomura explained:
But the difficulty levels and various enemies are randomized as well (most of them being more difficult than others). And now there is a new enemy type - the Rekan.
But you can only take out one, and you can equip magic guns.
And now there's another new boss.
But you can only take five, and you can only use spells.
And now there's another new boss.
But you can of course switch the difficulty all you want, but you can only do it once.
So they are going back to the good old good ol' style.
-----
FiXalaS: I'm glad Nomura is back
-----
No Depth: I’m not sure how far through the game they want to go, but I’m sure my heart aches for the end of KH3.
-----
Kaitos: I don't even think they are rebooting the game, but rather they move the story along at least from a starting point. What? They did the exact same thing with KH2. They just wanted to move the story along rather than rebooting the whole game?
-----
FiXalaS: I find it incredibly stupid that they used a remade Disney world to complete the game while the story is going along.
-----
Kaitos: In KH3, you can of course, equip magic but they are also giving you a new enemy type. In KH2, they had a new version of the magic for your reward.
-----
FiXalaS: They changed the hell out of the last 2 kingdom hearts to Rekka.
-----
Kaitos: I mean, it was a completely new enemy type. But they did add a new enemy type that looked like Rekka Rekka.
-----
DarknessTear: Think of the later KH games as prequels to the original movies. You need to have a thread ready to go to jump into the new stuff. They're just "more of the same shit" in terms of story. They're reboots. They're changing the story. They're changing

~!~The Utopia Project: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Phantom Thief: By By using the official Zelda wiki page, I'd like to draw a parallel between myself and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and draw parallels between both games. Given that the consensus among players of the game seem to be that it's one of the best games of the generation and of this generation, and that therefore I think it's a day one purchase for me.
The main reason I'm drawing parallels is that both games are also similar to Breath of the Wild, in that, while Ganondorf is the only main antagonist of the game, he does not appear to be the main villain of many characters. In fact, both games are set up as very much connected, and both games have a grand unified narrative theme.
This is despite the lack of any indication that either game is connected in some way, and that it's one of the best games of the generation. I will draw my own conclusions by using a few examples of apples to oranges.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Ganondorf
Ganondorf
Ganondorf
Breath of the Wild
-----
Phantom Thief: I think you meant BotW, in that sense.
-----
Jawmuncher: I like Breath of the Wild. I like the game to be played in a way I've wanted to. But I can recognize that it's a little clunky at points.
-----
Phantom Thief: I mean, I know how it would have been for me, but that's what I have been used to.
-----
Cartridge Games: Huh. I think linking to the wiki would’ve made it a little easier to do

I think I like it better than BOTW in some ways. But it is a better game than BOTW.

Durden: With this coming to digital, and the first game being announced officially for Switch, I thought it'd be fun to make a thread about what you'd like to see from a Shadow Warrior 2 for Switch.
I'll go first:
1. 3DS (and later Vita)
2. PS4 (and later Switch)
3. Switch (and later games)
What do you guys/gals think?

Giga Man: I'd want to see a Shadow Warrior 3 for the Switch.

Ganondolf: I want a Shin Megami Tensei 4 for the Switch.
-----
Vampirolol: I would want a Monster Hunter World-like turn based combat system. 
Also a Phantasy Star IV-styled JRPG with a main storyline that takes place over 20 years after the main game.
-----
Weiss: A 4-D game set in feudal Japan. A cast of supporting characters that keeps going on in the game as Mitsuda explores the setting.
-----
Clov: I'd LOVE a 3DO, with the way the game works would be amazing. I'd even take a Dragon Ball Z RPG adaptation of the Dragon Ball Z manga.

FluxWaveZ: I'd want a dungeon-crawler for the Switch.
-----
Tathanen: I'd want a proper Paper Mario for the Switch. Just give me more Paper Mario games than Mario games.

Cartridge Games: Probably a board game. 
It’s the one thing I want from a Switch. Maybe a handheld spin off, but I’d prefer a more traditional game

~!~What is the best fighting game of the past 5 or so years ?

Neoxon: With Street Fighter V & Tekken 7 on the horizon & Smash Ultimate being announced for the fall, it got me thinking about some of the best fighting games of the past 5 or so years. While we're at it, let's talk about the ones that were dope, or at least fun for a few matches. I'll go first and the GOAT, Street Fighter IV.
SF IV - It's a bit of a tough one for me, but I remember that being the most fun I've had playing a fighting game. It's also one of the most visually striking games I've ever seen, even if the 3D fight system is nowhere near as good as its sequel.
Tekken Revolution - A widely loved and competitive sim, but it's also a little too short & easy to get into. I remember loving the feel of the remaster, & the new stages & announcer.
Beyond that, I can't recall a single one that really cemented my place as the GOAT.
-----
Hanbei: Tekken Revolution. The only other ones I can think of are Ninja Gaiden Black, Tekken 3, and Dragon Ball Super, but I think Street Fighter V cemented itself itself itself as the GOAT with its strong presentation, music, and gameplay.
-----
JusDoIt: Tekken Revolution. It's a good, fun game, even if it has some issues. I fell in love with the story and feel of the gameplay focus and it was the best fighting game I ever played.
-----
Zomba13: Tekken Revolution was the first and only one to make me like fighting games. It was the first fighting game I ever played and it was the first fighting game I ever finished and I didn't have to fail all the time before you finally fight Atarax Ihia.
-----
Neoxon: It's definitely one of the GOAT, especially if you consider the 2D fighters that appeared on the platform.
-----
Neoxon: I'd place it above all else. Be sure to grow your character in the process.
-----
sibarraz: There are some great and impressive games coming out this year that will hopefully make the list, like MK11 , Guilty Gear 2, Tekken 7, SC6 and maybe even Monster Hunter.

~!~Your favorite "I don't know what to do, I gotta go home" moments

SolVanderlyn: I just came back from an entire day of work, and some of the greatest moments in gaming came out of today.
What are your favorite examples? Mine would be this one:
I love when it happens, it's so awesome. The sense of accomplishment, the feeling of accomplishment when you finally complete a challenge, and the memory of the accomplishment. It's like an ocean in space.
What about you?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: GOAT moment
-----
Aigis: The one where you don't know what you need to do to survive
-----
Nakenorm: Damn, this was right.
-----
Mazzle: This one
-----
kadotsu: I'm gonna say MGS2. I hated the slow feeling of going home and feeling "guilty" for not attacking the person that was hiding in the basement or something. And the satisfaction when you have done that and you realize that it was all done in a selfish, rage inducing way.
I love the battle of Kato, this was the first or second time I saw someone fighting another person and they just ran to the side and started brawling! Holy shit.
-----
Het_Nkik: This is an excellent one. When you're seeing the entire world on fire, it makes you feel amazing, even when you're not there for it.
I love the battle of Bangkok. You can feel the pain that is still fresh in your soul after facing the bitter Angkorans for the first time.
-----
TheBaldwin: The one that made me feel sad at the beginning. 
The entire island is still in the middle of when the final boss started.
-----
Acquiescence: Having just finished Sonic Mania on the Switch, I had forgotten just how much I wanted to punch those poor bastards in the mouth.

====================
~!~FNA (French Noun)

darz1: I know the term Noun are hard to translate, but i think the explanation French Noun is similar to English noun.
I am french speaking and i used to think this guy was referring to french peeps, which i think are called "Nouns" or peeps who speak French.
Anyway, here it is :
FNA (French Noun) is an English word that means to refer to any definite noun, like "the" owner of the farm, or "the mother of all farm animals"
FNA is also spelled Fama-Noun, but spelled that way to make the French sound "noun".
I have a french audio pronunciation of the name "Fama" for the above two things.
-----
Syril: It's not so much a French word, but the name "Fama" makes it sound "father".
-----

====================
~!~Oculus, just can't get behind the push for VR.

Waggles: Oculus has pretty much abandoned VR.
The Oculus Store is still being slowly updated, which is an inconsistent product with no indication that it'll ever be updated.
I don't know if this is widespread or not, but the Playroom for the Vive was just fucking atrocious. It was literally a huge mess.
The Playroom in VR is the best version of the Rift I've ever experienced. The color screens and psvr ports had me sweltering a bit, and the controllers were terrible.
I don't have too much hope for the Vive Pro's future.
-----
Lant_War: Oculus Store is the antithesis of consumer friendly.
-----
Mushroomer25: The Vive Pro Controller is still the best of the bunch.
-----
inner-G: I've been using Oculus store for a few years now, but I just don't have the time or desire to go back to obvs. I'm still fantasising about the Vive, but I'm not sure it'll be possible.

====================

It's Capcom's best selling game.

Dark Cloud: Well deserved. Congrats.
-----
Tibarn: Nice numbers. Congrats Bamco.
-----
louisacommie: Congrats, the best selling rw ip of all time
-----
cw_sasuke: Not bad for an exclusive, uhhh.
-----
Metalgus: Not sure if it was related to multiple contracts, but I think Capcom was hoping it would be a success considering the other MegaMan games that have came out in the past years. I wouldn't even know if I was. 
Congrats to Capcom, I'm interested in their games now. The lack of a trailer this month is very disappointing...
-----
Dark Cloud: Well deserved. I wish I was as happy as Bamco.
-----
Deleted member 42686: Such a great game. So happy.

TubaZef: Oh my god yes, I loved this game so much.
-----
Kouriozan: Great Switch support, and the Switch port of La Mulana 1 was announced at E3 2018.

~!~The year is 1710, I guess you'll be able to give your birthday to Fortnite

Bansai: Well, not in the way you think, but in the way you'll be able to share your "own" (timed) wishlist with you, you'll be able to give your child a wishlist with a wishlist, you'll be able to give your child a wishlist with a wishlist, so this could be a new feature to the Fortnite mobile game, it could also be a new feature to the mobile game, so my question is, in the way you think, Fortnite could you go to the point where you'd be able to give your kid a wishlist of a wishlist of an item that you'd be able to give them for free? Or do you have options to give them a wishlist, and you can't do that, and in the way you're thinking, you'd be able to do that, and in the way the game gives you the items you can't get, in the way you'd be able to do that, in the way the game gives you the items you can't get, in the way you have the items you have to "keep track" and you have to keep track of it, where you can get them and when you get them, you can give you the wishlist you have to put them in the game.
I'm forgetting a few examples, but there's a lot of neat stuff I could be thinking about if I could share with you, so I'm just starting to think about it.

====================
~!~Lara Croft is in Smash Bros. Ultimate, what are chances for a sequel?

Neoxon: The three main characters of Smash Bros. Ultimate, namely Waluigi, are already confirmed to be in the game. But what are the chances that we'll get a sequel to the game? Metroid Prime 4 is in the bag as well, if that's what you're asking.
Obviously Metroid Prime 4 is a next-gen game. But the chances are not that high. Other M is still due a sequel, though it'd be weird if it was Metroid Prime 4. Metroid Prime 3D was in the bag, but Metroid Prime (3D) was a whole new world created by Samus Returns. And Samus Returns is still the face of Nintendo from the beginning. It's crazy that we haven't seen anything from Metroid Prime 4.
The other two main characters are entirely unannounced. But that's a topic for another time (lol).
-----
Lashley: I could see a sequel for sure, especially since they're doing a sequel with the same composer.
-----
Neoxon: Metroid Prime 4 is unlikely to be featured in Smash 5, but Metroid Prime 3D was in the bag as well.
-----
Jahranimo: I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel happens. I know we've had dreams about it, but it would be such a shame. I can't imagine a more perfect time to make such a sequel.
-----
Neoxon: I'm not sure why you think a Metroid Prime 4 would be a perfect time for Nintendo to reboot the series. But it'd be crazy.
-----
Neoxon: I would say the chances of a sequel are pretty high.
-----
Salty_Josh: I thought it was just going to be a continued series going forward?
-----
Neoxon: The chances are pretty high. I think a sequel would fit in with Nintendo's current strategy to make their service play a part in their games.
-----
Zen: Metroid Prime 4 for sure. No other entry in that series has ever come close to matching it.
-----
Neoxon: In a perfect world, I'd say the chances of a Metroid Prime 4 would be zero, but hypothetically in Sakamoto's head they go with 3, and Fusion, and then Prime 4.

~!~What year are you playing?

SuperNerd3000: Just finished Wolfenstein 2 on Hard Drive and I was thinking about the year I'd finished scary games. Here's a few I have in mind for this year:
2017 - Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 - I finally got the AI to deal with sneaking and it's been fun.
2018 - Red Dead Redemption 2 - I've just started the main story. I'm a big fan of the first two main stories and this one has been great.
2017 - Spider-Man: Asamiya seems to be on a roll with a number of great games. What do you guys think?
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I’d be playing The Elder Scrolls V if it’s been in development for five years.
-----
detuned radios: I’d be playing Dark Souls 2 for the sixth time. It’s been almost 6 years since the last good game I played.
-----
LonestarZues: I'm playing it right now. I've been playing it for the first time in almost 30 years since I got it on hard drive. I'm definitely playing it this year as well.
-----
TheBaldwin: I have been playing a lot of Far Cry 5 and a couple of games in the series since it release.
Its been about 2 years now since I finished Bloodborne and while I loved the game, I think it is still a great game
Ive been playing a lot of the first two witcher 3 campaigns. Theyre great and its been a fun ride with great writing and pacing
-----
HueyFreeman: I'm trying not to get too caught up in all the waiting for Black Ops 4 post-release, but I'm coming back to Knack for sure. It's been a great time.
-----
daxy: I'm playing it right now as well. Love it to death. I hope it goes on to inspire other developers to finally make games as good as Knack 3.
-----
FairyEmpire: Valkyria Chronicles 4, although I have enjoyed a lot of other games in the series since the first one. Been wanting to get back into it, though.
-----
Dervius: I've been playing it more than any of the other COD, and I've even started playing it during the campaign.

~!~Can we talk about the superior audio quality of the NES classic?

TheGamingNewsGuy: I was just playing some NES games and listening to them on the Classic Headphones sounded amazing. What a great way to play the classic games! I was amazed how good the audio from the NES classic could be.
Today I was thinking about how well the audio from the NES Classic was in games like Castlevania and Super Mario Bros. Another thing that struck me was how good the quality of samples is (probably this has been a thing for a while).
NES games have a lot of low quality samples when audio is low. They have tons of dynamic range options and can be played with samples of the audio from any device.
What was the purpose of including a sample of Castlevania in the game? Was it to capture the same quality of samples that was available on the NES classic?
What was the audio quality like? Was the audio from the NES classic enough of a leap for the audio chip to take?
I know that there are other ways to hear audio but I don't know which is right. Does anyone have any audio experts to compare the audio quality of the NES Classic and the SNES Classic and tell me how good is the audio quality of them?
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The audio in the SNES classic is way better than the NES classic and there is a very high bitrate difference
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The audio on the classic is very good, even if the source is a music track.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I see

====================
~!~Why are Nintendo's Online Services so Bad?

Jawmuncher: Im just gonna say I love Nintendo's services and thought it'd be nice for Nintendo to have a official answer for this. 
From my understanding: 
- They offer a small selection of games at a lower price. 
- They require you to pay for the games. 
- They have to matchmake players for subscribers. 
- They charge you extra to access certain games. 
- They have a shit ton of games in the Online Subscriptionary. 
- In particular, the games are awful. 
- They charge you extra for games (e.g. BotW and Smash)
-----
hibikase: They don't want their service to fail.
-----
Lkr: What a disaster.
-----
Dyle: Nintendo's online is terrible and I agree that they should charge more to play online
-----
haradaku7: the problem is that the paywall for online matches is a thing. the only way to get those online matches is to pay for the service through a subscription service. the reason why they don't charge more is because the paid subscription service is already in place.
-----
Cartridge Games: They’re a service. If they don’t provide enough online for their service to be able to get online matches at least they’re not getting the free ones
-----
Noppie: Because Nintendo's online is a competitiilty product. Not like they need to charge for online.
-----
Medalion: and the problem is the service is a service, and the paid subscription is a service that covers every game you can play online
-----
P-MAC: Because Nintendo’s online is service, and if they don’t satisfy the requirements they’ll be charging for it at some point.
-----
hibikase: They're selling their online service, Nintendo.

====================
~!~I'm starting to feel some previews are getting tinged negative.

Ametroid: I just finished Sekiro and I really liked it but some of the things I disliked were
- No stamina and death at all
- Lack of variety in fights (5 enemies in some variety of unique ways to damage you)
- Lack of bosses to fight in or out of.
- The lack of enemy variety (I know, I know)- A lot of the above but just not that good or enjoyable
- A lack of bosses to fight in or out of.
- Too many side missions.
And now I'm feeling some positive about it
I've been playing for almost 2 weeks and while I like it it's not the best in the genre or anything but I feel like it's a lot less than the last game of the trilogy.
The enemy variety is something I really like. I think the game is pretty good overall.
I'm just gonna take a look at the game and see if I like it.
-----
Ametroid: I feel like there is a lot of jank that comes from the lack of many types of souls bosses
Dark Souls was supposed to be a souls game but it was made by a different studio (Konami) and while the boss variety is nice it's not that good
-----
Cartridge Games: The animations are pretty solid, not sure if that's improved by the bike or something but they're pretty easy to pull off.
The combat is weird, but I like it
-----
Ametroid: Is it better than Bloodborne? I just beat it on PC, I don't remember it being that good but it was certainly well written
-----
Hexer: Loved it for what it was. I'd still be playing Sekiro but even so, its more of a Souls-type game. I'll give it a shot.
-----
TheBaldwin: I was gonna get it for the first time. Tried so hard to get past the first 2 areas in order to get a feel for the game, but it didnt click. But now it seems I will.
I don't trust From to put out a good souls game now that they are the king and Soul Reaver2 will be his first.
Wouldnt surprise me if they go out of their way to make a game more fun if they made a new one

~!~The Order averaged 8 hours on my Xbox one X before servers shutdown

D65: It's almost always a 10-15ish hour game and it averaged 8 hours on my xbox one X.
Didn't believe it

D65: I usually don't care about servers, but this one was really fucking annoying

ActWan: Guess I'll finally be logging on.
-----
D65: Yep I'm logging on because I want to be able to see all my trophies and achievements.

Anung: I've never played this before but I was thinking about this today and how annoying it would be to have to wait 15 or more minutes for my friends to play the game and then not have to wait a damn thing when I log back in. I'm all about gaming, yet I'm not a console only gamer.

KZXcellent: The Nintendo E3 Meeting is a good idea.

skittzo0413: It's a meeting with E3 members and journalists. It's a meeting Nintendo themselves.

Eolz: Hahahahahahaa this is great, I already had my minds made up about Nintendo meeting with E3 people weeks ago.
Thanks, Nintendo.

~!~So, is there a reason for Microsoft and Sony to be so negative on the PS4?

Phantom Thief: Sony has been pretty much killing it this generation, they’ve been selling a lot of PS4 exclusives, and their support for the Pro has been great. 
So, I ask you: does this bother anyone else? It used to bother me when the PS4 was first announced, but it’s now been pretty manageable. 
I’ve never seen an issue like this, especially considering the size of the market for the system. 
I’m not asking for $499, just asking if it bothers you about the size of the market.
-----
KingdomHeartsFan: No. I don't buy my games in a system they own.
-----
Rychu: You’ll get over it if you look past that point.
-----
Cess007: There is, but you need to buy it twice and completely put the console back on the shelf.
-----
Phantom Thief: Sure, but that’s not really true.
-----
Kolx: I don't think there's a point in asking anything for a system, if you don't have to buy it.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, the whole point of owning a console is to play the game on the box. And don't care about the box.
-----
Flandy: Lol no
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m asking for the console to give up on you, your account, and the system, to give you a PS4, for the sake of the system.

====================
~!~If you could only choose one game to represent a genre or conceptually or within a genre, which would it be?

MaverickHunterX: Personally, I have a soft spot for games like Earthbound and Dream Cute Insects. 
Dream CUTE IMAGINE
I would be a little puzzled to see the two games mentioned on this list not being represented in terms of what they do, though. 
Dream CUTE IMAGINE NOT JUST TO TRAIN THE UNDERTERS OF THE CHILD
I can imagine this being an absolute must. The kid was really cute when he was a little bit old, I'm pretty sure he'd love a good game with him in it. 
Dream CUTE IMAGINE NOT TO BE ADORED
I also think it's a perfectly valid reason for a game not to be represented which I feel devalues the work of individuals, so I can certainly understand why someone would want their favorite game to be something other than what they already like. 
Would you be a little confused by this statement about respecting individual creativity? That's not what I'm suggesting, that's not what I'm suggesting for Dream Cute Insects, and that's not what I would be interested in Beyond Good and Evil.
-----
Phantom Thief: Metroid Prime.
I’ve actually been thinking about this too a lot. I’d love to play it, but I don’t know if it’s in the cards for me.
-----
Jawmuncher: I have a soft spot for Earthbound.
-----
BubbleButt64: I'd like to see a game with a dog.
-----
Cess007: I don't think this happens often enough for me to want it, but I do like to support titles that have good writing, as well as good gameplay.
-----
FluxWaveZ: I'd love to see a game where you pick a protagonist, and the game plays out as your hero goes through a journey through the different timelines. I know this isn't exactly what "Dream Story" means, but it could work.
I always advocate for the more important thing, the gameplay. This isn't a "should I play X game before bedtime?" thread, because obviously the answer is YES. But otherwise, I'd love a game where the game PLAYS as the game, and you

~!~Old School fansites get a free pass on the 2019 Generation

~Fake: I saw the post and thought it was interesting.
The list of the "new" generations of oldschool games from the 1970's and 80's is pretty much complete. This is pretty interesting.
-----
Hoot: Interesting, I kinda assumed that the games were the same but I didn't know that there was an archive for the previous generation.
So I guess we'll never know for sure if the games are new or not.
-----
CannonFodder52: Nice, hopefully new games are coming
-----
Mondo: Nice, i'll have to check out the other ones.
-----
Shahadan: Is there an old school game collection page?
-----
Omnipotent: Dootman is back baby!
-----
Pachimari: I would love to see more games get re-released. I know the 1UP got a few PSP collections but I never owned the original systems.
-----
Dwayne: Nice! I bought an OG PS3 last year and all the new ones I got were on sale or re-releases, so I just got all the new games as well.

~!~What is with the constant use of the "Buy 1, Use 2" strategy in online gaming?

TheEchosOfTheCyborg: Every single time I see a new thread that turns on the "Buy 1, Use 2" or "Buy 1, Use 2" strategy, I see posts from friends who are convinced their friends will spend money on Fortnite if they buy it, or they see a poster with $50,000 in microtransactions on their bank card or is that 2014, someone who thinks they'll be able to buy it on launch day with their credit card but isn't, or maybe their friends, but I just see this trend repeated so often it's ridiculous, that a week ago, I got a Fortnite Battlepass sub or wishlist with 100 games and I can only buy two.
-----
Sargerus: I thought Fortnite was dying.
-----
TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I know right? Nothing wrong with that, but it's weird to see people draw up a defense force to try and drive people to buy games they don't want.
-----
TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I always enjoy seeing the defense force in action, such as the people who are willing to buy Fortnite, I've seen people who go "wait until the game is out" and "oh you got money" and I'm always really surprised to see a defense force up their game, I mean I've been playing games for over a decade and enjoying myself.
-----
TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I'm not even sure what the argument is, but maybe it's all of the above. The reason I said this is because I have been researching Fortnite for a while and I want to understand more about what is going on in the Fortnite community.
-----
Lashley: It's all about the whales
-----
TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I find it all more frustrating, because I just feel like all of this is sucking.

TheEchosOfTheCyborg: I feel I do, but I don't know why I feel this way.

====================
~!~Is there a video game series you can play the complete series?

ScOULaris: I've been playing a lot of Yakuza, but I'm wondering if there is a title I love the more I think is complete. I know Yakuza holds up the best, but I'm not a sports commentator sort of guy for the series. I think the only sports games I can really call home is Counter-Strike (so that counts for me), and even then I don't really get to play them as much as I should. I was going to play the Dragon Quest series in recent years, but I'm not sure if those are the types of games I'm most interested in.
I'll be playing through the Yakuza games for the first time right now, but so far I've found myself not really enjoying them. They're just... not very good.
-----
mrmickfran: The 3 games I want to play for the series are all in the current console generations. They all suck.
-----
5taquitos: I feel like I'm in the minority on this, though I adore Yakuza.
-----
Kamiyouni: I have a limited time to play them as they're very tough.
-----
Dullahan: I've been playing Yakuza for the last 18 months or so and the only masterpiece I've ever beaten was Xenogears. I don't know what the series is about anymore, but I know I suck because I don't respect the skill of the developers.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: Never played the Dragon Quest games, but I've played a lot of Golf Story.
-----
StarPhlox: I know I do, I suck, but I love the games. I like the "one on one" crafting of the Yakuza series, I like the action in the Yakuza spin-offs, I like the fact that I can pick and choose which weapons I have access to for my characters. I don't like a lack of variety in the game play of the series, the combat in the Yakuza games isn't engaging at all.
I think the only Yakuza I've ever really enjoyed and enjoyed was the Yakuza liksisse (Which I am extremely missed on). Otherwise I think I'm a pretty average player.

~!~I'm still confused about the Online component of Kingdom Hearts III. Does it have online play or is it just a collection of worlds?

mogster7777: I just beat it and thought about how good the story is. I was not expecting much at all and it’s ok but I wished I could play the games online but that’s why I need a PS plus membership so I can play online.
Its not even a huge game so it makes sense I thought it would have a lot of online play and the world being the focus of the game. But is the game actually good? Does the story actually matter that much?
I just beat everything but some bosses so yeah.
I haven’t played the game for more than 10 minutes so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m really confused and I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing and what’s going on here.
-----
Aigis: I understand what you meant, just be patient and play for the story
-----
Markitron: I am really confused. I haven't gone back to KH1 yet, but I'm supposed to be playing it for the story.
But I'll assume I'm playing it for the characters, story and gameplay. It's a collection of worlds, not the entire world.
-----
hydruxo: If you want to be clear on what you mean, its a collection of all the worlds in the series. So you're playing for the story, while you play for the gameplay.
-----
MiguelBañón: I mean if you want to play for the story and not for the gameplay, then yes.
-----
Aigis: No, just play the game.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: I mean, you don't need to play KH for the story. The games are already told to you and you don't need to follow any instructions.
-----
MiguelBañón: Yes, that's what I meant. The story is the main focus but the gameplay is secondary.
-----
Ratchetdude231: I mean, you can pretty much guarantee that in the game, all the worlds you visit are from the Final Fantasy games.
-----
mogster7777: I think I’m just confused about something.

~!~Kirby's Dream Land 1 vs 2

Segafreak: Kirby's Dream Land has a lot to offer. From the colorful maps to the charming art style, Dream Land 1 is quite picky with a lot to choose from.
So which is the best one to start with? I am going to go for Kirby's Dream Land 3 and 4 first. But first I will pick Dream Land 2 first.

Dyle: Dreamland 1 is by far the better one and if you ignore the weird pink palette, is by far the better one.
I think the rest of Dreamland 1 is pretty good.

~!~PSA: Should I buy a PS3 or PS Classic?

ThisThingIsUseful: A friend of mine is super into retro consoles (he already has a 360), he has a PS3 and he's been loving it. I don't think there's a PS3 classic that he's actually interested in, but he's heard amazing things about the PS Classic.
-----
Raptomex: I mean, I had my PS3 on launch - it was a great device, but the lack of backwards compatibility really made me buy a PS2 instead. I ended up kind of flipping it on launch day, which was an experience. So maybe I'll eventually pick it up again.
-----
Acquiescence: I'd just wait a few years, because PS2s are way past their peak.
-----
Mikey Jr.: I think you should wait a few more years.
I’m still not sure if the PS2s BC was near ready to go.
-----
Raptomex: Hm.
I'll do in a year or two.
-----
Mercenary09: I know a few people that got the PS Classic and some PSOne classics over the years.

~!~Super Smash Bros. Ultimate UK Sales Now Over 67 Million

Zippo: With the recent discussion about how much Smash needs a Smash Direct to succeed, we thought it might be interesting to do a UK sales retrospective. Not just for Smash, but also for any other Nintendo game to be released on the eshop.
Sales figures for the past three months can be found here.
Feel free to add your own UK sales successes and predictions.
-----
Porygon: Great result for the game and good for Ultimate!
-----
carlosrox: That's good.
UK is a huge market.
-----
srtrestre: Great!
-----
Platy: That is good.
But I am not sure how relevant that is then
-----
Zephyriel: I'm surprised the Switch is actually the best selling system in Europe. Nintendo is notorious for shipping to other regions with barely any of their releases come from the UK. 
Regardless, good result!
-----
Datajoy: I thought Kirby was second?
-----
skittzo0413: I'm still not sure if Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best selling system in Europe. I think it was slightly better than Wii U but still not by a lot.
-----
The Last One: What's the UK sales number for all of those games?
-----
Pancracio17: I am shocked that mario kart 8 deluxe got more than a million copies.

VirtuaRacer: Just announced at the Kinda Funny Games Showcase.
Seems to be a remake of the original game with a new protagonist. No more references to previous games.
-----
Bizzquik: Excited for this. To hear some more info about the PS4 version.
-----
Lant_War: The remake of the original is one of my most anticipated games right now, and this looks like a good way to do it.
-----
Cess007: I'm really excited for this. It's really weird to me that the original game is in a console port, and this looks to bring back the original gameplay.
-----
Aselith: Looks great. Was wondering when the remake was coming out
-----
Cess007: I love these retrospectives by Waypoint. Always a pleasure to read these.

chandoog: This looks fantastic, gonna keep an eye on it. Always down for some coop action.

Starlatine: this is all I know, but just watched one of these apparently
excited to see it in action

~!~What is the best and hypest DLC in gaming?

SolVanderlyn: I love DLC. I'm a sucker for new games, but DLC has never been my main in the last 3 decades. I love that there's more to this game than what's in the base game. I just love that I'm in a world where there's so many new things being added to it.
In most games DLC is usually the last thing you play. DLC is what makes a game worth playing, not a season of DLC. DLC is what makes a game worth playing, not a feature or mechanic added.
I love DLC, but it's hard to understand why it's been for other series. Besides the quality of the story and characters being added, they're just costumes or extra content. Without additional stuff to do, DLC is almost non-existent.
What do you think is best?
-----
TheMoon: DLC is the last thing you play, because the game balance allows it.
-----
Brian Damage: I thought the game balance until Dawn gave the player infinite life. It was nice when the game made fully-explorable worlds or open areas a thing, but it's pretty much dead.
-----
ZeroX: The DLC
-----
Vicious17: DLC is good, and it's only really needed if you like a story-focused DLC. I love when the game gives us characters that are just skins of other characters.
-----
Yerffej: I love it. DLC is the last thing I buy after a game comes out.
-----
Cybersai: DLC is the last thing I play. There's so many weirdo DLC and shit that I don't feel I have to play.
-----
Mediking: DLC makes a game worth playing. Raids are good. I love them when they are free, but I hate them when they are locked behind a grind or MT.
-----
Dracil: DLC is the best thing in gaming.
-----
Vicious17: I don't really agree. If a game doesn't have a good story and you want to play it, the dlc is much better.

~!~Let's talk about Pro Wrestling Manager 3

ZiggyPalffyLA: I've been playing this game for a few weeks and it really feels like a classic WWE pin-up wrestling game. The wrestlers are all super-star and there is a lot of depth to it.
The game is only available on Steam and PS4, but if you have the PC version, you might be able to get it on those platforms. Then if you'd like a good wrestling experience, you can play it with a pad or a cramp required.
I've only played and finished the second game and it is pretty fun. It's a bit rougher vibe than the first one, but that's because it's more pin-up-y and it has a lot of gimmicks that aren't really really fun. The game is also a bit hard to play, and if you're not super skilled, it's very easy to get a draw.
The only wrestling gimmick I really really like is giving wrestlers nick names to work out. It would be nice to be able to have a wrestler nickname to work the game out. I liked how it was just you had to call certain characters by their picture to be the names you used in the first game.
The game is slightly rougher in the story beat and has the loli bits from the first game. I was interested in it since it was first announced, but I'm not sure if it was offered also for ps4.
The only gimmick I really liked was the game's episodic schedule.
Story wise, in terms of how wrestlers are treated in the game, it's a very good story. The matches are paced and have a real stakes. The game has great variety of personalities to it.
The game is also pretty cheap on the PS Store. It's $19.99.

SnatcherHunter: Oh.. wow. 
I still have my ps4.. and I want to jump in when I have some free time.
Now I got WWE manager.. gotcha!

~!~What are the best gaming laptops?

whiskas_fanatic: Hey everyone,
I have a few thoughts to share:
I'm planning to get a laptop that is able to play a lot of games (as well as games for iMac and Linux) and I use a ASUS ROG Swift PG279Q Gaming Laptop (3880AT, 15" touchscreen) and it's so cool to be able to play games with so much care.
I'm going to make a few things first - I have a gaming laptop and I'm going to be able to play all my PC games on it - I only want it for gaming (preferably 100% in-home use, as I look to play a lot more on the go).
I will be able to use a PS4 and Switch on it, and I will be able to stream Steam games to it.
I have a GTX 1050 and a GTX 1070 (with a 980 right now).
I have a 27" 1080p monitor and a 3440x1440 ultraw dithering monitor.
When I can play it on my Xbox, I will choose to run the games at 1080p on my PC, while I will be able to play at 1440p on my consoles, while I will be able to play them on my TV.
I have a Geforce Now controller, which I know is not very good (performance for the controller, not for the controller, for the PC, for the TV, etc), but I have a GeForce NOW Pass 2, which I know is not very good. Because my PC is not powerful enough for Geforce Now, I will be using it on my Xbox.
I know that Intel is not very expensive right now, but I don't know if I can afford another 1% of the Geforce revenue.
I know that by doing this, I am also getting a great future by gaming on my Xbox and PC.
I know that Microsoft will give the laptop away, but it's still not possible to use an Intel CPU so currently I can only use the Windows Store version of the application (unlike my MacBook Pro).
I know that Apple will probably sell the steam link software (from Steam link app), but I don't know if they will be doing something similar to Intel.
I have a i7-7700HQ GPU so I know what to expect, but the Windows Store
====================
~!~What is the best "Indie" game you have played?

Masterspeed: I've always had a soft spot for the Treasure-heavy games, and this year was no different. I loved the Illusion of Gaia, one of my favorites ever, and the first one I played was The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I loved EO too, but that was more about Illusion of Gaia and Link's Awakening being more traditional adventure games like that. I also had a soft spot for the Blasphemous games, I loved the first one and the world in which they were set, but I wasn't ready to play the second one yet. So I just beat it for the third time, so I'm pretty focused on what I've played of it.
What is the best indie game you've played?
-----
Svart: Journey.
Like always, I've tried to play the first one, but just can't. Too much story steeped in "narrative" and I just end up getting bored of the gameplay. As in Jesper Kyd's work.
-----
Svart: I love to look back on indie games and see what made us favorites.
Love Jesper Kyd.
-----
Much: I love The Binding of Isaac, and that was back when I first played it as a kid. I love the art and atmosphere of the original game too, but the gameplay just feels so slow and unresponsive to me. I never really got into the co-op aspect of the game either.
-----
Starlatine: The atmosphere is so hollow
Level 5 nailed the isolation of a particularly good ost.
-----
Starlatine: The atmosphere is a very good thing in itself, i agree the music is also very good
-----
Takahashi: The Binding of Isaac.
-----
Indelible: Journey, the atmosphere and atmosphere.
-----
TheYanger: I like the atmosphere and atmosphere of the first game, but the lack of real creative freedom in the second game really hurt it.
-----
Aprikurt: I think I prefer The Binding of Isaac over The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ (if it’s not worse than Overcooked 2). The last game’s atmosphere was great, but The Binding’s atmosphere was great in combination with the concept of anemia.
-----

~!~Forza 7: What should be in the box for Phil Spencer to sell Xbox One?

FairyEmpire: As a fan of the original games, the new Forza, and to a lesser extent, the Online component of Forza, I've been very intrigued by the rumours that Microsoft was making a push to bring one of these upcoming Forza games to the Xbox One. While I am aware many will scoff at the idea, I would say that the core gameplay of the series is a lot more varied on current systems than it was in the past installments. The best example of this is the main character, Jorg. The game plays identically to the original with the same music, a similar structure, and a new cast of characters. It's a new sports game, it's heavily focused on simulation and simulation-lite elements, and is admittedly super expensive to make, but at least the game's been available to us for a few months now. The Xbox One version is $100 cheaper, the Playstation 4 version is $99, and PC is $140.
With that said, the main cast of fans is, quite frankly, pretty much all the wrong people. Jorg is an incredibly weird, over-the-top, weirdo, and hilariously stupid character -- a black character that comes across as a black man with a silver cape and long, pointed hair. He has a completely unique dialogue with his companions. The game also doesn't really use an open-world nearly as much, with the exception of a few short segments in the side activities and levels, where the game goes into a mostly linear style with a few intermissions and puzzles that fit a 3-hour race in a shopping hub. The main story is a bit more linear, with a few intermissions that are more comedy gold like, and a few interludes in the side quests.
However, what I really want is Forza Motorsport 7, a Forza Motorsport game, a full-on open-world racer, with an open-world dialogue system. The Forza Motorsport 7 engine is based on Lotus Turbo (McLauro F1 RS, and it's only one of its many variants), which means there is a lot of variety in how it's looked, and how cars and drivers behave. Imagine something like Forza Motorsport 6, which had a variety of exotic cars roaming the map at high speeds. Whereas Forza 7 is based on Motorsport
====================
~!~Should I go back to Horizon ZD?

arbok26: I bought an Xbox One last week and have been playing since launch week. I've had a PS4 for a while, but I've had the Pro and XB1S for a few months now. I've heard that the game is fantastic and I'm hesitant to double-dip it.
I've heard that the game is buggy but I've never had to use a single power. I've heard that it has issues with freezes, rendering the game stuttery like many claimed. 
I've heard it has technical issues that seem to only affects the closed ecosystem mode, and that the game is so large and customized that you rarely run out and get nothing. 
I've heard that while in the middle on the map, sometimes there is a level score penalty and I've tried to play a bit and I've never gotten past the first level. I've also tried respawning bodies but it didn't help. 
I've also heard that the game is so huge that it's difficult to play if you don't have a controller. 
The game looks beautiful however. I've heard that the frame rate is really sluggish and the game has some really really slow (or very slow) moments. 
I've also heard that the game is kinda tough after the first few levels. 
I've also heard that there are some really confusing and/or sometimes too hard puzzles that take a lot of time to complete. 
I've also seen that the Xbox version is currently $20 on sale, which got me thinking about getting it for 30%. 
What are my options if I'm missing something? I'd love to hear it if I can.
-----
pswii60: The game is rough to play when you have a controller but if you can, you can probably just pick up a new controller if you want to try out the online stuff.
-----
ryseing: It's okay, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to beginners. I tried it for about an hour yesterday and had a lot of deaths so I couldn't do much.
You'll also have to deal with a bit of learning, especially if you're not fussy like me. The controls are sluggish and finicky. I'd suggest you stick with the claw claw scheme and try again. The game is also hugely multiplayer.

~!~Every moment in The Witcher 3 is the best in the franchise

Phantom Thief: ​Imagine a perfect video game moment where a story moment came to mind. The moment where you know a particular character is going to be going on, you know what to expect, the moment where you know the story behind that, the moment where you know what the characters are doing, the moment where you know what they are doing, it’s a perfect moment.
But this one, this one single perfection perfection, this one moment for every story moment was the best in the entire franchise.
-----
Green Slime King: Unrelated, but is Witcher 3 the most story-driven game series out there?
-----
hydrophilic attack: the entire protag in blood and wine was the best, but the protag in blood and wine made up for it with some amazing writing and pacing
-----
Ahasverus: The battle of Stroms begins:
-----
TheBaldwin: I feel Witcher 3 is really the only one to end on a positive note.
The witcher 4 ends on an absolutely awesome note.
-----
Kuro: Wow I feel Witcher 3 is truly the best in the franchise. Its so good.
-----
Jarod McChicken: I can't think of a single instance in all these games I've played where a story moment made my experience so far.
-----
BocoDragon: Bloodborne runs counter to expectations. I have never played a game that had more than two characters with completely different abilities and attacks. Can’t imagine how disperficently OP this game is.
-----
Cess007: I feel Witcher 3 has 3 best characters after TW3.
1) Geralt uses a key item to open the map and is completely safe.
2) The journey is amazing and has amazing music.
3) I think the story is great and the characters are great.
-----
Saint-14: I think it’s the best in the whole franchise but it’s also the weakest one.

~!~Sooooo... what's up with Nintendo and the "don't buy shit" stance?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I've been getting this kid who's only 4 and he's big into Smash Ultimate since it's on sale. He's about 6 months old and he's able to play Geno. He's never played Pokémon before. 
And we already know he's big into Smash. 
Nintendo's stance is that if you don't buy shit then you should. 
No warranty here. Embrace the Nintendo brand. We've been there. And the past week or so has been a blast for us. 
But the last time Nintendo had this hardline stance was back in early 2013. They decided to support Pokemon Go with a huge open market and I remember a lot of people were not happy with this. 
They said people in Japan were confusing their enthusiasm with Nintendo's dedication to actually doing what they love and I don't get this. 
They gave out free shit months before the game was released, so they're not getting this. 
They hate us, and we don't understand. 
It's been over a year since the game was first announced, and I'm not sure if Game Freak is supposed to be giving this the same attention we have. 
Did Nintendo really hate us for giving this game the same love it needed eight years ago? 
I mean, there's a reason people hate them, and we're all wet dreamers for a few reasons. 
But I'm just curious as to what they decided on. 
They're treating this like a social issue, like a physical one, a "don't buy shit" stance. 
How do you feel about this? 
How do you "love" Nintendo and their games, regardless of what people may or may not think about their stances. 
What are your thoughts?
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I actually like Nintendo’s approach to social media with their shopping and social media approach. They just have to be careful with it since it’s pretty disgusting.
-----
Mediking: Yeah, I want to be able to shop without my internet caps in my own city. But I just hate it. I hate so much.

Vicious17: I like it. I also love that it won

~!~It's 2019, I have yet to play a JRPG...

ADee: I'm at the point where I can finally get into the world of JRPGs and I always get excited for the mystery and epic feeling that can be come across when you get to play it, especially the ones that are coming later this year.
I recently played Octopath Traveller, very good game, and I just thought to myself, 'Im going to fire it up, and see how good it is, and then do my JRPG fix and start a new game.
I have finished all mainline JRPGs: Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Phoenix Wright, Tales of series, Pokemon, Yakuza, Persona, Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest II, Dragon Quest III and FF.
What are your recommendations for JRPGs that I should do?
I'd like to know as well.
-----
Mattakuevan: I love JRPGs but I think I'm done with them for the good of the genre. I started playing Octopath in my favorite game of all time Octopath Traveler. I really enjoy the art style and the gameplay is just so much better than my favorite RPG.
-----
Syril: In the end, I'd say you're going to get more enjoyment out of playing games from a personal standpoint.
-----
Azajabar: I am starting to feel you, OP
-----
Nick Nehidnyk: I'm one of those people who can't play games as they are written, and I've been gaming for the last 25 years at my own pace. At these times, I tend to just sit for breaks and soak my time in. After coming from JRPG syndrome, I can't imagine going back to a traditional JRPG anytime soon. 
But, I'm not big on grinding. I love to beat the story and get good ashens and math and stuff. That's why I've found Octopath is so much better than most turn-based RPGs.
-----
Aters: Start writing more now when you're ready to go back. I haven't played a JRPG in years.

Odeko: I’m playing through Dragon Quest XI soon, too.
