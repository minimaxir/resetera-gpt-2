~!~Onkel: Shards of Darkness is the best new F2P mobile game since Ra'saur

Arthoneceron: Full disclosure: the gameplay does not warrant the quality of the game, and the quality may vary from the above in a way that is worth the investment. However, look at the following:
- USD $20 release price
- lots of content
- high quality of content
- it's only one person game, the game is self-contained. building and shrinking the game can be annoying, there is also a very good PVP but mobile only.
- lots of monetization
- it costs a lot of money. Even after you finish the game you can still unlock loot and other things
- You can keep playing
- It's only on Android only
So yeah, it's on Android and iOS, you can get it for free.
In case you are a fan of FG but have not played a FG game before:
-----
Giolon: I think it’s the first game that I’ve played with a subscription to GamePass. I’d rather they continue the series. Actually, I’m not a FG player, but I never felt a connection to it.
It’s a very good F2P game. The only problem is that I don’t know if all the players are playing together on the same team in a big party mode or a party against the other team. I’m gonna be honest, I’d prefer a group wipe and team Conquest over a conquest mode but that’s a pipe dream.
-----
Giolon: I’d rather them keep post launch support for this game, than make it a drip feed of updates rather than a huge cashgrab.
-----
Giolon: I’m not against full fledged real teams though. I’d rather see them try and cater much to the teams of their more experienced players in a big way.
-----
Otakukidd: I have the game on superior Android too.
I have it on my phone, but i think i play a bit on my vita.
-----
Giolon: I guess you prefer the "social" game where you can keep track of everyone’s teams and activities, but the other players can still play as well.

~!~Rayman Legends -- The Boardwalk Simulator

Mcjmetroid: Apparently this was supposed to be released on PC a bit ago but that was botched.
Anyone want a physical version?
-----
miserable: that sounds really bad
-----
Accoun: Gonna be a shoddy product otherwise.
-----
GibdoInferno: This looks like boardwalk simulator, if it had good controls.
-----
KoolAid: The PC version is a mess. I'll wait for a physical version.
-----
Ametroid: Also the boardwalk simulator 2 is coming out
-----
KoolAid: That's on PS4
-----
Xwing: Not even close.
-----
BernardoOne: 2 is coming to PC as well, which will make it even more of a mess
-----
Mr_Moogle: The boardwalk simulator is a piece of shit.

~!~If We Happy Few turns 10 Years By No More Heroes Did You Rescue Your Online Friends?

Realeza: This topic is all about the reaction to the game's announcement. I couldn't find a thread on the other thread about it.
In my time with the game, I came to like, love, care, and I have so far really had to express my admiration for this game's ability to adapt to the internet. I have been interested in the game for a while (it's being published by Devolver Digital!), but now I find myself on the edge of my seat with a game that I have absolutely no interest, it's releasing this summer on Steam.
I have already enjoyed my time with it enough for me to want to continue playing it. I'm very excited for the sequel which will be released on May 31st.
This game is a revelation, and the reaction/adoration it had after playing The New Colossus was enough to motivate me to continue playing it.
For those who haven't played it yet, here's a trailer from the game's release window:
And here's some gameplay from the trailer released in March, playing it on PC:
In my time with the game, I had no interest, I really have no interest at all. I like the game's aesthetics and worldbuilding, I like the game's music, I even like its story. It is an amazing game, but it's not something I particularly care for. I want to play it, but I am going to play it anyway.
-----
Strafer: I was about to say it was the opposite.
-----
Thorrgal: I would say it is one of the best games ever made.
-----
Dusk Golem: The game is a huge improvement over The New Colossus and, on PC, one of the achievements has been added, seems like it's a download to play; some people on the old console side have been asking about it for a long time, and I have to say I'm pretty excited about it, it seems like a lot of fun.
-----
GlamFM: I think it's one of the best games of this generation, and one of the best games of all time.
-----
TheMrPliskin: I love the game, it's my favorite game of the generation so far.
-----
labpleb: I picked it up, bought it

~!~Nintendo Switch Online App Not Working

WhoTurgled: I've had a Switch for about a month and a half and the app is just asking me which games are online and of course I don't know what game I want to play. I'm trying to sign in with my Nintendo account but I see I don't have an option. I'm hoping to load up Arms or Mario Kart but that didn't work either
Anyone else had this issue and have a solution?
edit: I guess it's because I've had the same problem for a few months now
-----
Derachi: Switch online games on the Nintendo eShop.
-----
WhoTurgled: I've had a Switch for about a month and a half and a solution is to attempt a connection to an amazon.com site. Both the US and UK listings have the same options. I'm hoping to just load up a game on the Nintendo eShop on the same link.
-----
Derachi: Yeah, Amazon has a range of troubles with this if you're into that sort of thing. 
You can try a distance of about 200 feet, try a quick test on the internet.
-----
WhoTurgled: I've had the same problem for a few months now and am trying to link to games that I can play online.
-----
Derachi: I'm hoping Nintendo will fix this as well. I'm hoping to finally play some of the games that are available on the eShop.
-----
Derachi: I'm hoping that's not a problem. I'm hoping that if it works then it works for me.
-----
WhoTurgled: I'm hoping that's not a problem. I'm hoping that if it doesn't work then I'll be able to find it on the internet.
-----
Derachi: It might be an issue with the Nintendo eShop servers or something else but I hope it's not an issue with Nintendo. 
I'm hoping that if it works then it works for me.
-----
Derachi: It's a software issue for me as well. I've had issues with the software app on my Switch in the past, however, so it's not that serious.

-----
Bansai: Yeah, it's crazy how big TLOU sold in 10 days, it's actually pretty impressive.
-----
Sou Da: I'm glad it's been 10 days. I'll be there day 1.
Also, I'm surprised it barely sold more than 2.5 million.
-----
TheMrPliskin: Well it could have sold more if it was more common.
-----
BoJack: It's not. I'm not sure if people are just lucky and only get a week of sales if they buy a game and put it on sale. That's not how sales work.
-----
N.Domixis: I’m shocked it sold more in the first 3 days.
-----
Zem: I'm sure there will be people who buy a game on sale for days, but I think it's pretty par for the course.
-----
N.Domixis: It’s not. People who buy a game for a month usually bump it up to 2 million

TheBaldwin: For me it is pokemon firered and blue++
I have not played any of the pokemon games since the early days, but i still love these games. 
Plus, the soundtrack is amazing. 
What is your favorite game of all time?
-----
Odeko: It’s gotta be DQ11, for sure.
-----
Zippro: Red and Blue++
-----
RochHoch: I'd have to disagree, but I'd say Mega Man 11
-----
Omar310: Pokemon Gold and Silver
-----
Ravelle: Rondo especially for its soundtrack.
-----
TheBaldwin: It’s gotta be FFXV.
I’d say it is, but I think Red Dead Redemption might be my fave OST ever.
-----
HStallion: Final Fantasy XII is my favorite game of all time but I'd go for Fire emblem: zero dawn.
-----
HououinKyouma00: The first game I played was Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky. I loved the music but the lack of certain tracks really bummed me out.

~!~New Resident Evil 2 Previews

Dusk Golem: It's kind of a wet fart to say this game has had rough patches for the last couple years, but here's a small sampling.
- The game is looking pretty good from just a preview from Game Informer.
- From the first day they released the game, they did a ton of work to polish up the final game
- The game actually looks and sounds really good, the first time they showed the game was at E3 2016, they showed it again live at E3 2018, they just showed it again there.
- It's gonna be a while before we see the final game, but I'm sure we'll see some new gameplay footage soon.
- They did a bunch of new interviews with key staff, they did some more in-depth videos, they just didn't explain it all.
- The game is releasing in like under a month's time, they just got to the "veil" phase of the game, and of course they're gonna go out and release some regular stuff here.
- They're going to have the game in a pretty plug story mode for the end of the month, they're gonna continue to update the game in that way for a few months at least.
- The game's still gonna get support updates before it finishes, not gonna stop there.
- The second DLC will be on the 18th so they'll probably do that for a couple more weeks.
- The game has a new Monster Hunter stage, they are going to do it in a month.
- There's a new trailer being shown this week, they're gonna reveal it for sure, and then they're gonna go to the "veil" phase and then build a brand new game on it.
- They're going to release the game on PC & PS4 on the same day it's coming out in Europe, but their PC version is gonna finally get a date.
- They're gonna announce the new DLC for the Resident Evil 2 Remake on the 19th for real, but the announcement of the first DLC is gonna come right before it.
- They're going to announce the first DLC for the Resident Evil 2 Remake on the 19th, and then they're gonna build a brand new game on it.
- They're gonna announce the first PS4 port of Resident Evil 2 Remake on the 19th.

====================
~!~The PS4 is killing it this year. What are your top 5 gaming handhelds?

nando: Here are the best and the worst out there:
PS4
Assassin's Creed: Origins
Dragon Ball FighterZ
Mario & Rabbids: Kingdom Battle
Pokemon Quest 8
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
The rest are below. I know a lot of people are more excited for exclusives and small indies here but if you were me, I'd just turn off the lights for the rest.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think I might be feeling optimistic again.
I don’t think PS4 is amazing and the Switch is offside of one of my favorite consoles.
Smash is probably a no-brainer, but I’m interested in most first-party stuff
-----
Ultimadrago: I love everything about PS4. I'm very happy with my Pro, but I have issues with the Pro Controller.
That said, I'll be picking up Odyssey and Splatoon 2, as well as Far Cry 5.
-----
Shark: I have a Pro Controller for all of my games except for Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
-----
nando: I know right away that if sales of games on PSN go through, it will only get better for sure but I'm curious on what's out.
-----
apathetic: Mostly just happy for my current situation, but I think the Switch is on its way to surpass PS4 again this year. I got a launch Pro and have a lot of games that I want to play.
-----
MWorldII: It's not a console war, I'm pretty sure.
-----
Aokiji: Yeah it’s not a console war, but a lot of people are focused on one platform for too long.

Ametroid: I have a pro but I don't even use it for third party stuff
-----
xenocide: I use PS4 for everything.

ULTROS!: Thanks to MatPiscatella for the high-quality pictures!
The game had a physical release date of November 21 2018. Since then it has hit a milestone of 500k copies sold.
The game was released on May 8 2018 and for the first time in Tales of content.io in a decade.
-----
Vault: Did I miss the newest one ?
-----
ULTROS!: Nice!
-----
KZXcellent: I wonder if it'll have cross play?
-----
MajinArekkusu: It's good to know. Hopefully this one is better in every conceivable way.
-----
shadowhaxor: That's good to hear! I bought the first one on release date, and it still runs well enough. I wonder how they'll implement this content.
-----
Robioto: Thanks for posting.
I'm interested in the game, but never thought I'd get to play a Tales game since most of the sequel(s) were free.
-----
Lant_War: I would have preferred a Vesperia remaster, but this is great.
-----
NarohDethan: I have no clue about the future, but Tales of Berseria was one of the best of this gen, well worth the price of admission.

~!~Assault Spy: Black Ops 4 - Spy vs Spy vs Spy?

TheDanimal: I’ve been playing Call of Duty since Black Ops 2 and I’m kind of glad I got into it because it’s one of my favourite franchises.
Assault Spy is the best part of the game, and it’s the first time I’m truly invested in the world. There are no objectives, you are completely free to go anywhere. The missions are all kinds of fun, and there are some story bits, but most of the time it ends up being just boring kill-and-glitch stupid fights.
Pros:
- There is tension
- It’s gorgeous. Look at all those moving objectives, and it’s kind of a shame that the objectives don’t scale all the time. 
- There are always spy ways to back tracks
- Fights are smart, and usually end in a way that’s kind of great and unique. 
- Stealth is fun and engaging
- The characters were great
- The story was engaging
- Characters were all well developed and had memorable dialogues
- It’s a CoD game for fans of spies 
Cons:
- Some objectives are bullshit, like the mission that requires you to disable a sensor. 
- Stealth is not as interesting as a spy mission, and the stealth is not that good
- Story felt like a game that was designed with the people in mind who designed The Last of Us 
- Some of the missions in the regular missions were boring, like sneaking out a guy in an interrogation center. 
- There are some bad characters in the final missions. 
- There are some cutscenes that are annoying but I didn’t notice them. 
- There are some visual effects that remind me of The Matrix but they’re pretty tame. 
- Some of the stuff that happens in the mission is just a b-movie, like some explosions. 
- The game really rely on scripted assassinations, like one guy doing a push-kick move in the beginning and another doing a headbolt move in the end. 
Cons:
- It’s a CoD game from the outside. There’s no real stakes, there’s no set goals, and there’s just a

Cybersai: Fire Emblem Conquest

Raijinto: Mario Kart 8 is a tie between FE and MK.

Pastebutty: Fire Emblem is my favorite
Also, FE is easily my favorite franchise so I'm gonna say FE

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: FE, mario kart, zelda.

Hailinel: I'm gonna say Fire Emblem Conquest.

Odeko: Fire Emblem is my favorite franchise so that's pretty much it, I would have to go for that.

RockmanBN: Fire Emblem Conquest easily. The whole game is amazing and the map is actually pretty short.

Cantaim: The only other ones I can think off are the Super Mario Run and the Metroid games.

antitrop: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

====================
~!~Your favorite character (and why) from an anime or video game made by an anime director.

SolVanderlyn: First things first: I'm not talking about the director here. I'm talking about the character designer.
I love Shounen. I love the way his designs try to emulate the flat-out amazingness of VNs and visual novels. I love Shounen. I love the Layton setting. I love the crazy energy that goes into all of this. I love the quirkyism. I love the deep, lived in moments where you can develop your own whims, or an entire world. And I love the characters. And I love the story.
I love anime. I love VNs. I love VNs. I don't think I've ever had more interest and investment into a game or series as I've more or less accepted the genre as a whole, and I've never really cared for any of the games in which they're made.
And I love anime.
I've never been much into the plot of Okami, and the first time I played it seemed like something I'd like. It was, in part, because I had grown up with the likes of Final Fantasy, Phoenix Wright, Phoenix Phoenix, and that whole Detectiveective trilogy that got a T for story. But I was raised on the idea that anime could be as good as films in that sense.
So I decided to give Okami a shot, and boy, what a ride.
I sat down with Okami. I sat down with the first movie. I sat down with the second movie. I sat down with the finale. I sat down with the final boss.
Okami was a slog in almost every regard. The fight against the final boss, the climax, the resolution. Okami was a disappointment in almost every regard. The fight was way too short, and you could beat the fight over and over with one combo if you wanted. Okami is a game, and it was so badly designed that the ending itself is the biggest gripe in the game. The game ends with Okami being supremely predictable and the final boss not being worth the sacrifice.
Okami felt like a video game finale, and it was...good. The fight against the final boss for the fourth time was a triumph, and the final boss didn't suffer a single death either. The real heartache was the fact that

~!~The last time you played a game that had a great story?

TheFallenSaboteur: I'm not sure I can answer this question because I have a healthy amount of time in every month that I spend gaming but my opinion is that I have played a game that had a great story, but I could not tell you what it was that it had that was great. What game did it really reignite your appreciation for it?
I have played a lot of games from last year, I have played a lot of RPGs, Resident Evil Remake and Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but most of my time has been with Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, Dark Souls, Spider-Man, Bayonetta, Shadow of the Colossus, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.
-----
Silky: 428: Shibuya Scramble
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: No seriously! I mean I've played games that have fantastic stories and I've played many that were amazing. I've played plenty and found quite a few that just gave me an amazing vibe of exploration, wonder and discovery. I've also played some that kept my eyesight and listened to the story piece by piece. Unfortunately it doesn't really set the whole tone for the game for me.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: I don't have the time for this but I've been itching to play a story driven game to put into my backlog. I'm currently in the middle of one, but I have other games to play to keep an eye on. I just want to know how well it really pushed the point that I always knew was over with most games.
-----
Cess007: RE7.
It was the first game I played that made me say "this is for the fans of the franchise, no!'".
It's the first game that made me re-examine my perspective and how I play games. It's the first game I ever played through with a story behind it. That's pretty good, I guess.
-----
TheFallenSaboteur: That's pretty good actually.

~!~The State of Xbox 2019 - Can we stop with the console wars?

Maneil99: Let me be clear, this is not about "Is the XBOX ONE viable or viable and if it is then who then". This is about a discussion about the need for an evolution, and a discussion about how best practices can be found to bring the Xbox One X to market today.
I think the discussion should be interesting, and hopefully Phil Spencer addressed the concerns people have with the console in his State of the Xbox recent speech.
He talked about keeping the console competitive, and investing in backwards compatibility, but that is all just rhetoric. He mentioned the XBOX TWO during his speech, but I think we need to have a better perspective on what the future holds, and the future we will see Microsoft implement policies towards improving future
-----
kadotsu: If they want to beat Nintendo in sales then the Switch is their only hope.
-----
Aiustis: The S is the future of gaming. 
Now it's time to let go.
-----
Seedy87: "Concentrate your content, man. We're not letting you play one game at a time."
We've come a long way,
And sadly, the people who keep consoles like the Switch and X1 are the worst that NeoGAF will come around to shove in the console race.
-----
Aokiji: It only needs to be a two year policy.
-----
Maneil99: They want to play one game on a capable device, and if they want to do that they should also play one on the next iteration of the console or PC.
-----
Lothars: I think the next step to the Xbox family is to ensure backwards compatibility is offered for every platform. 
They should be working towards that.
-----
Aiustis: I can see it working for other purposes. We have now crossed the line where Microsoft is testing out the waters with the Xbone.
-----
Maneil99: If they don't give us a good answer then it's not a good system.
-----
Benji: If they get the adaptive controller then why even bother? The Xbone has a higher refresh rate and is super rough in games. It would be great if they could integrate some configuration into the system, but it's a no go.

~!~What's Your Favourite Gaming Laptop Gaming?

Mr.Deadshot: Hi everyone,
I love to browse my PC. I've been gaming for over 30 years. My first console was the Atari Jaguar and now I'm well into my second generation. I started my PC a few years ago and it's still rather good to this day. I have a few questions:
1. I've owned a PC and have it plugged into the PC Engine but I've never had a problem.
2. I'm a PC gamer since the Sega Master System. I've been getting a PC for almost 10 years now.
3. Is the Switch a good laptop?
4. I believe my laptop is a bit of a headache to find deals on. The Surface Go was a good laptop with a good gaming mouse, keyboard and VR headset, but you really are talking about the best gaming laptop I've ever owned.
Thanks!
-----
Silky: Your laptop is a headache to find a particularly good deal in the U.K. I don't think it's a good machine, but I'm sure if you prefer its more portability over your rig I guess you probably have a fair share of it.
-----
Eolz: 16gb i7, pretty much everything else is under $1, but PC Engine is very good, I'd get anything for that.
-----
DocSeuss: I love my PC, but I'm going to go with a 3.5 or 4gb SSD. I don't really like having an extra 2TB HDD to swap between (for example, I used to have a 4TB HDD laying around, but never could get that thing working properly. Now it's $400!)
-----
J75: What type of laptop are you anyway?
-----
Finaika: Anything that is a gaming laptop.
-----
Podge293: I love mine, i've been using it for around 3 years now.
If you have a laptop with a SSD i'd recommend a regular laptop but if you can get a decent one with a few more games especially if you don't mind having the OS updated to work on high end hardware
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I've been using a laptop that came with an SSD for quite some time now. I'm using a 2tb 6gb, but I'm not a fan of games on those devices. I

~!~Where are all the mobile MMORPGs?

IbizaPocholo: MMOs, MTs and ARPGs are all pretty much everywhere on mobile. There's even a big ARPG coming to the iOS in October called Cataclysm, which looks like a mix between FFT and WoW.
I think the only stand out series to me that I love right now that I would consider "MMOs" is Final Fantasy XIV. I love the idea of this game has a lot of depth, there's a lot of content, and the mobile gaming audience is usually pretty diverse. I like the idea of being able to create your own character and having classes which you can play on your console, and even has a mobile version of XIV.
The combination of all the different classes into a single game is something I think that I love as well. There are a lot of great, unique experiences to discover, of which there's no shortage. I think MMO's are the only ones that I don't know about, and perhaps I should try to play more.
-----
Ghost305: Mobile games are the only moba type I guess. They are so incredibly expensive and hard to find so I just stick to PC.
-----
Caeda: Oh yeah OP. I love the idea of an MMO on mobile, but I really prefer mobile. Mobile is just easier to make and play than console but I can't deny it. I just wish that there was a better F2P version of XIV.
-----
Ringten: I prefer PC/Mac/Linux
-----
Noisepurge: I've been playing FFXIV a lot on my phone. I like the idea of having a sandbox MMO where you get to create your own character, with all the classes available to you.
I'm interested in a guild based on that.
-----
TJ_Electronica: I just picked up an iPhone 8S over the weekend. I use it for MMOs and ARPGs and that's about it.
-----

~!~My neighbor kid plays on a Switch (Broken Dock and Battery Issue)

ChristopherDX: Has anyone got a picture or a video of the Dock or battery life of the Switch that they are getting for christmas in Germany? My Switch is plugged in and the battery is not doing enough to support the port. I am about to get a Switch and it does about 4 hours of play before the battery dies. Is it dead? Is that normal? Is there any way to reset the Dock or get the Switch out of the dock?
-----
ASaiyan: Broke Dock are typically much more rare than battery life issues. I have had a couple of such bad docks, and they've all been in the form of completely borked. Luckily for me, the battery life of the Switch itself hasn't been too bad to my knowledge, so I've been relatively careful. No idea on how long these bad boys can be, but I'm wondering how long without reset.

~!~Why is Nintendo's First Party Acquisition of Control such a Package Way Later in the Game Industry (For Developers)?

mutantmagnet: I just found this article on ResetEra.
It talks about first party (and even pro consumer) acquirements in the past.
The implication is that Nintendo will be the market leader in terms of allocation of resources going forward. They have been very successful at that in the hardware space.
But how exactly is the reason so far?
I find this article very interesting.
I'm a graphics junkie so I have a lot going against the way in which this article is being written.
-----
Meelow: One of the reasons why is because Nintendo is now in a position where they can make a good profit on their games.
-----
Jahranimo: Why is it that they are the market leader now?
-----
BDGAME: Because they introduced online multiplayer mode.
-----
DesmaX: But is it the same as this? I just bought a Switch
-----
mazi: huh. i thought this was just another area they were in since day 1
edit: i read the article in the title, we all know they were the market leader when it comes to games
-----
Jahranimo: Ah that does sound like a good argument for the former.
-----
Kuro: The money Nintendo is making from their first party is exceptionally well timed.
-----
Fat4all: one of the things they need to profit from is that third parties are getting increasingly harder to do than they were before, while third party output is still being impacted by the boom that was the first half of this generation

Hero of Legend: Well, it's generally a publisher's decision to invest more to support their platform rather than push it aside to meet the needs of their platform.

~!~Would it be cool if Nintendo made a new Fire Emblem with a female lead

Hero of Legend: I'm not even a stranger to female leads, personally. Awakening had a pretty cool female lead. I like the game as it's... not a direct sequel.
But a female lead in a game of Nintendo's style would be a pretty crazy thought. Especially when you consider the fact that we're already given female leads only in games like Xenoblade Chronicles.

~!~Darth God of War: Why you should play it first or play it in order

Memento: Doth we really need a poll now?
I may be the only one that knows)
So I just posted this in favor of this PSX interview where I talked about a lot of things, so I wanted to share it with you guys.
And it probably won't get enough clicks, but we will talk about this in the OT.
Anyway, I think we can safely say that the game is very good and perfect, with the right kind of combat system and of course the right kind of story and story telling. It adds a lot to the atmosphere and the story and it even adds a touch of wonder and mystery to the game.
Yes, we are talking about a game that has a whole lot of mechanical and artistic aspects, but also a few artistic qualities, and also a few artistic shortcomings.
Here is the quote that I posted in the thread of the game yesterday.
So, here is what I just said:
There is a good reason why we should play this game first, it is a classic classic JRPG experience. And if we have to, it gives us a reason to play the best genre in the business, specially action games with RPG mechanics.
And, if we play it in the order of release, it is an amazing experience.
Of course, we should not play it in first place. The game is not a masterpiece, but it is one of those games that got better when you played with a better understanding.
-----
Lant_War: The game is absolutely perfect for the first couple of hours. The story is dumb, you can't even tell if the main villain is a kid yet he's there lmao.
-----
Hascines: You can tell if the villain is an aged heiress or aged woman when they both are talking. 
Just cause a villain has a beard on his head lmao
-----
Aokiji: I’m not sure if you know the villain. I’d just say the one with the big ol head hero glasses. Hmm. 
And I’d like to know what the other characters look like

Cascadero: I think you should play it in release order, there is no "order" of the game. You can choose your first and last lines in

~!~The Making of Sonic 2 and the Hedgehog [Slash Rope Spin-Off]

Jawmuncher: So I wanted to share with the other members a bit of history on the 2D side of things. While the edge case is to say a 3D Sonic game that's more in the vein of Sonic Adventure/Contra as opposed to Sonic Heroes. The biggest issue with the topic is that it's kinda weird how Sonic Heroes is just on hiatus. So I wanted to start a little appreciation thread for this series.
So what the hell happened with this title? The same crazy creative decisions were made with the Sonic side and it just kind of fell off. Then again, the spin off games were an insanely successful force to go to to go home. So I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not, but I'd like to understand why this was such a big deal if I had to guess.
Sonic Heroes is really one of the best sidescares in video game history. It's a game that just really wants to be changed for the better. The game's story is pretty much a shared theme throughout the game. There is a lot of backstory to be had. It's got a lot of backstory to dig into. 
But how many of you guys remember this game? I tried to remember but my head is a bit weird. 
Don't get me wrong. I would be all over this. But I feel like nostalgia just wanting to play as Sonic. I don't want to say I love it. But I really do want to. So here is my case in all of this is for those who wanna say something about it. 
This game just completely reignited a love for me. I seriously can't go back to. Even though I know it's not as good as Colors and Generations. But when I look back on it now. It's just utterly amazing. Even though I've always been a fan of Sonic and the Secret Rings. 
And I say that as someone who adores this franchise. The Sonic the Hedgehog movie just released and it just got released on the same day. Just absolutely stunning in its cinematography and presentation. As if I was in a real Sonic game. 
I'm just in love. Especially now that I'm actually enjoying a playthrough of this game. Especially as a Sonic fan. It just blew my mind back when this game came out

~!~Apple removes (and shares) App Store reviews [Up: Deleted]

Krejlooc: Hilarious given how Google was the one to pull it, but Apple is really the only one to actually remove App Store reviews.
The thing is interesting, because Apple apparently has some sort of set ups for review-sync. You have to open the App Store (or something like that) if you're synced with the App, and you can open the Synced Apps options in the official Apple-exited app.
I wonder if Apple plans on actually deleting the review scores, or searching for them by name. I guess they won't.

~!~How do you deal with backlogs?

Tiny Chihuahueño: A big part of my life. Growing up, I was the only one with a job. My day jobs didn’t allowed me to buy as many games as I wanted. I could’t commit to as many hours as I wanted, even though I was much more into RPGs. 
However, things have changed. Now I can play games whenever i want. And I don’t have to do that since I’m busy with backlogs. 
This is why I have been playing my Switch, and it’s because of how I play them. Whenever I play a game, I have a new game to play and I start to play it whenever I want. 
So now, I have a backlog that allows me to play a game that fits my interests and time, that is not hindered by my life as a kid or busy with work. How do I deal with the backlog? How do I treat my backlog?
-----
Lkr: Find a nice game and go for it
-----
Indelible: I usually just play games, but when I feel like playing something I'll start a long long long long list of the games I want to play.
-----
Maxina: I try not to do this, it's destroying the routine of having to have a backlog.
-----
Slamtastic: I have the opposite problem with long time/no game/etc. and I just get my ass handed to me in various ways, including games, and I end up just playing the games I want.
Like, I don't even have a game that I needed to in certain circumstances, but I still play it when I have the mental willpower to do so!

TheBeardedOne: I usually just play, but I don't play games too much now that I'm older. I find I don't want to play at all when I'm ready to start new games. I don't want to start new games or worry about them becoming obsolete later.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Then I'll start the ones I want to play, but I'm not sure what.

Simply Sami: I've done a couple of marathon races and they all had long, detailed races that involved me and the teams of other runners up until release day. I started doing more marathon races with the longest number of races and cleared the last set of hurdles before running up to the last point and getting gold.

DanteRavenkin: I've done a couple of races on the road and I just don't have the energy to go straight for the longest time. I don't have a lot of time anyway, and if I'm playing a game I want to play the right way, so I'm usually listening to my friends, or my favorite game developers. 
I'm doing a lot of open world marathones lately, like AC:O or Forza Horizon 4, where I'm really focusing on the open world.

~!~What's the worst version of a video game remix?

signal: I have a small opinion on RDR2's OST, but I have to limit my thoughts on it to the original.
I've never been the biggest fan of Rockstar's GTA soundtracks but I've played every Rockstar game to varying degrees of success. Most memorable for me being the GTA 3 Vice City soundtrack.
But I've never been the biggest fan of the Skyrim soundtrack. Always been a fan of the original modding tools that Rockstar used to make, but I've never really been able to find the right way to play the Skyrim soundtracks.
For example, the first time I played the Skyrim mod was with the Creation Plus. I played Skyrim and made a bunch of sound files and it was pretty good. But I heard how the game used the Creation Engine to make some jingles.
I heard the Skyrim mod was pretty good too. But I think the Creation Engine is just weird and not a great place for a game like Skyrim to stay.
So I tried to imagine what it would be like if I just played Skyrim and made a bunch of sounds and found a new meaning to the character and the world.
I know people like to use the Skyrim sound files, but there's a reason some people may actually prefer the Creation Engine, especially when it comes to Skyrim, which is a pretty great game.
I know the OP didn't reccomend me advocating for the use of the Creation Engine, but I'm curious to what peeps can think of the worst soundtracks of the late 90s.

dadjumper: I was gonna post a classic Doom song, but you already had it covered. lol

Grisby: There's a lot of good Doom music but I like the ones that came out for STALKER.

Both of these are so fucking good, and the Evil Within 2 is easily the best game ever made.

~!~Video bug: For some, bug is greatly appreciated

Krejlooc: Ok, so, I took some of my my interest in video game development to heart, and I had some of the following concerns.
- I don't have a stable internet connection. So, I had to connect to a private server (which was completely unsecure and completely unacceptable for the reasons I mentioned) for the project. I was able to connect to private servers in a manner that was just fine for me (if disconnected by unlicensed channels). And you guessed it, I needed to connect to a server that was unlicensed.
- I only had a 2G connection, which is unheard of for me on the internet.
All of this is perfectly fine for me. I was able to connect to private servers other than Nintendo's, and they worked flawlessly. It's not a big deal to me that I've known issues with the Nintendo servers before, because I get these updates really quickly.
But, to actually play games, I had to connect to a server that was just fine. I was able to connect to a private server that was unlicensed, which I was able to connect to a server that was unlicensed, and so on. Just the prospect of having to play a game in the dark, and probably with annoying servers that are completely incomprehensible to anyone and have me play a game with a broken connection is completely off-putting for me. I know it's not the norm for me to get a game turned into a game for my birthday, but is it even the same level of frustrating?
So, I think this is a really good and unexpected thing, and I hope people appreciate it for people like myself. I just wanted to point out one of these issues that I found extremely frustrating, and hopefully others appreciate it for the people who play games and enjoy gaming.

-----
Theswweet: I imagine everyone having an XB1 anyway.
-----
Theswweet: I ran into another issue with the 2070Ti. This first problem is the 2080Ti not being able to use the full bandwidth of the GPU at full speed. This forced the GPU to only use ~50% of what the GTX 1070 can do. 
This also didn't help for ultrawide games.

The generals are generic guy.
The story-wise it’s the first half of the game and the one with the most twists and turns.
-----
Nirolak: The story of generals is pretty self contained.
The factions are all in a defined position and are motivated by the same goals, they do not have much to do aside from a few "heroes" they will start with.
The story in the second half is the main thing going into the first half.

~!~I'm really digging the art style of Pokemon

Theswweet: So, I just finished a Pokemon adventure game, and it was pretty good. I love that it's set in a region that's basically a melting pot of different time periods, and that each Pokemon has different moves and stats that affect the entire region. And honestly, it hit all the right notes. Some of the stuff in the games is really fun, like the characterization between the trainer and client (I think, but I can't remember what it was called), and the art style overall is really good.
But one thing that really bothered me was the art style. We all know the art for the remake Pokemon games, and that's pretty much it, but now I'm really digging in to it and really liking it. I remember liking the Pokemon Yellow art a lot, but I don't think it's anything like the original artwork in the games.
The video in this thread is really good, highlighting the artistry and craftsmanship in the games' backgrounds, and the quirky interactions of the characters.
Now, I'm not generally a Pokemon fan. I prefer the classic style of Pokemon, and I think the new one looks cooler by that standard. But I want to give credit where credit is due: the art style of the Pokemon themselves.
I'm not saying that the original art style didn't contribute to the craftsmanship, but it really made it all the more enjoyable.
-----
KZXcellent: I think it's pretty incredible. They nailed the feel of the characters and the art style. It's a shame that the remake looks like it's held back by placeholder models and models that seem to have been remade several times in similar projects.
-----
NKnight7: I really like the art.
-----
TwilightSparkleMotion: I thought the Pokemon designs were really bad.
-----
Theswweet: I know they messed up the intro, but it's nice that they're remaking it.

Theswweet: Ah, I didn't even realize the opening was so short. That's great.

Lkr: I think you get what you pay, maybe try a trial with some promotion.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think you can try leaving a comment with a Nintendo representative and form to say they're aware and can’t refuse you a refund. If not, it’s probably better to say they have a system that’s covered by warranty and I’d just leave that to you as they did a number of times.
-----
Kokonoe: I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but this is your best shot.
I'm sorry, but what's the refund option at the end of the transaction? What happens when you refund, but they refuse your account a full 20 days later?
-----
Captain of Industry: Yeah, I’m going to wait a bit for a refund.
-----
Noppie: Hm. I don't know if I can just leave a link, but I can't really believe the best solution is to give a private message to their support.
-----
Aters: Isn't that about a refund?
-----
Jaded Alyx: Do you forget to put the link in the OP?
-----
Captain of Industry: I can't :(
-----
Kokonoe: I have no problem with that at all.

~!~Do you think we'll see a Switch revision?

mazi: as more and more games are entering the market, the Switch seems to be the last resort for many gamers.
if so, what do you think is the general pattern for the console?
-----
Phantom Thief: I'm sure we'll see a Switch revision.
-----
KoolAid: My gut says it will be a new revision, but I don't think it'll be a revision by the end of the year.
-----
Cartridge Games: The price point and performance would be a huge downgrade for sure.
If it wasn’t a revision then I wouldn’t be surprised if it flopped
-----
Oheao: I'm sure we'll have a good time with the console. There is a lot of good games on the system now, and we've started seeing all the different versions coming out.
-----
XandBosch: I doubt we'll see a Switch Pro revision with a few exclusive features, though I'm not all that against doing what I want :D
-----
Phantom Thief: I'm sure we'll. I'm not saying it'll be a revision, but I'm pretty sure they'll work on the new model in any case.
-----
Fuchsia: I doubt we'll see anything for it.
-----
rochel: Can't even imagine how good it would be for the system, I guess.
-----
kadotsu: I doubt we'll get any new models for the system.

~!~What is your favorite Kingdom Hearts game?

Vire: I'm currently playing through Kingdom Hearts 1.5+2.5 ReMix for PS4 and I love everything about this game. It's a very bittersweet feeling, this series was known for a lot of things and was very popular back in the day, but it's also very much a Kingdom Hearts spinoff now.
Ultimately, I think it's Kingdom Hearts for me.
I'm a major Kingdom Hearts double-chociné and I really feel like I'm reading these books, but I'm really left, as far as the franchise goes, to be put down if I'm not playing with the Pip and the other characters.
As far as the story goes, it's really great. It's not stuffed like the other spinoff games, but it's dark and serious. I love that it starts with the group of whales, then goes nuts and steals all the important stuff. It's a real good story.
And for the characters, I really love the supporting cast.
I really like how the game starts out with the group of pirates. But then they decide to show the main villain the fuck up, and there's a lot of stupid cutscenes and plot holes with Sora and co. coming across a pirate. And then there's a scene where they're locked in a dungeon together and he's trying to beat the crap out of the other group of pirates but the other two have a plan.
I love the storyline. I've been wanting for so fucking long and now I'm happy for square for their to finally do this with a Kingdom Hearts game.
So what's your favorite Kingdom Hearts game?
-----
Joey Ravn: It's a really good one. The concept is just amazing, and the gameplay is just so fantastic.
It's also a very mature game, with an evil, broken ass view of the world from a perspective of Sora and co. and Sora spending a lot of time on a boat. It's one of those things where you're all just accepting to this world and the ever-changing story is just magical at that point.
-----
Alastor3: It is a good game, but not as good as I remember it. A lot of things are worse than I remember, the story is bad (I know, I played it), the characters are bad and the game is bad, but I don

~!~It's time for ARM to go back to the Original GBA/DS library

SantaC: Playing it again after 3 decades.

Krejlooc: Now we need the GBA and DS emulator on Switch with proper frame skipping and scanlines.
-----
Krejlooc: it's time
-----
signal: The same day I reinstalled my 3ds and am now thinking of getting my hands on a GBA to finally play this again.
-----
Kresnik: I can't believe it's been 3 years since I played it.
-----
SantaC: I haven't logged in for 17 years and this is my fault.
-----
CormoranStrike: I'm guessing this will be a permanent fixture in arcades.
-----
Krejlooc: It's an actual game. Someone will need to make a GBA emulator for it, just like with the Pokemon emulator. Don't think there's much there, but I bet a decent amount of people do.
-----
Pokemaniac: If the Joycons connect to the Switch properly, you'll be able to use the GBA for D-Press by Mizutsune, and you can also buttonpress specific shoulder buttons like Mr. X and he's happy.

~!~How do you go from being a fan of classic Resident Evil games to playing them?

SolVanderlyn: I've been playing a lot of the RE2 Outbreak mission mode in my progress. I'm not very good at the game, but I love the classic survival horror style.
I've always wanted to play this game, but I just can't. The campaign is so slow and boring, and the game's such a chore to get through. I was always interested, but I just can't seem to get into this. I really hate the classic Resident Evil style, and I'm always hesitant to buy new ones.
When they come out, how do you go from loving classic Resident Evil games to playing them? Any reason you do that? What did you do wrong?
In particular, I've always wanted to play the DS Resident Evil games.
-----
jstevenson: I play them as often as I can. Then I think about RE2 on my PS4.
-----
vestan: I literally only play them when I get the game. The only exception being the first mission where I played the DS version, and then I played RE7 on my PS3.
When I do get the remake of the original trilogy though, it's usually around 9-10 hours of play time.
-----
WrenchNinja: Only if you can stomach the slow pace. The DS version is great but if you like the old style then it's a big step down.
-----
theaface: I play them when I'm in a mood to play something. In the past had to wait a while, unsure of why. In this gen it's easy to just do a re-run. But if that's the good kind of play, then I'd wait, I'll be waiting for the gen to end even better.
-----
JaeCryo: I play them when I'm feeling down and I'm not usually a JRPG or a traditional, survival horror game.
I'm also a fan of classic RE, the DS version, and the original RE7 are all in my top 5 games of all time.
-----
Takahashi: Play the original Outbreak on PS1. It's ok and the pacing is great. Play the remake with the difficulty you like. It's a no brainer, it's a remake of the original game with the same gameplay but a

~!~How to Install Valve's Half-Life 2 mod?

Bufbaf: Valve's game modding scene has been on a rapid decline. Valve's modding scene is a peerless smorgasg of developers, artists and programmers. It's one of the few games that I can run on my PC, and for good reason. It takes pride of my knowledge and knowledge of the world of Half-Life and its lore, but I can barely run it. How do I go about install some Valve's modding engine mods for my PC?
I'm thinking on my laptop directly, and I'm wondering what's the best way to install these mods. I'm leaning towards the modding engine, because it's the closest to what I want out of Steam. It's got all the bells and whistles of the other modding engines, but it also has all the essential stuff that makes a good PC PC PC awesome.
I'm thinking about using the Windows Compatibility Center, but I'm not sure what the best approach would be.
-----
AgentOtaku: While you can use an editor I don't think there's anything that would enable you to effectively change the ingame text to match the ingame. I'd suggest using the Reddit Nexus site
-----
Windu: I would not recommend mods over mods.
-----
El_Chino: I only ever put mine on mods unless you use them extensively.
-----
dadjumper: Probably using mod authoring tools to change the ingame text. I only use them to mod out the parts that I think are important.
-----
texhnolyze: You can't do that for mods. You have to use mods.
-----
texhn: I mainly mod out the ingame text. If you don't have any ingame text in your game files, I would just use mods.
But yes, mods is the best option.

~!~Polygon: The 'Overwatch's Anthem' is the best realized story of the year so far

Nirolak: It turns out that EA took a lot of cues from Games Workshop and its other IP's and used it heavily in their design.
Highlighting the story is a common sentiment from the previews of The Division 2, and I thought a quick one at the end of the roll showed a lot of care put into the game.
-----
Truant: I agree. There are so many stories to tell in games.
-----
Kade: I thought it was pretty good.
-----
Shugga: Yep, i agree. It's easily the best thing Overwatch has going for it.
-----
Vicious17: This is the most insightful and well done article I've seen on Era in a while
-----
Nirolak: I mean, yes.
It's pretty much Overwatch's storytelling and writing that shines through in combination.
-----
Parenegade: Please don’t make me choose between lore and gameplay
-----
TronLight: The ending of the article is a good example.
-----
Parenegade: I loved the lore and it is easily the best thing that Overwatch has going for it.
-----
Kaim Argonar: I love it so much.

~!~Let's talk about the Twitch app.

Troll: With Twitch, you can stream from any device. There are no ads. There are a variety of things you can do with it. Do you like the look of it? Do you use it? Do you like the idea of a Twitch channel? Does it have a vibe?
I’m curious about what people think. I also have a Switch so it’s another possum.
I have a Switch plus it’s great to have all your devices connected. I have a PS4, XBO, and PC. One thing I notice a lot at my place is the lag. Is this intentional or unintentional?
-----
Llazy: I like it, I hate it when it's not used as often as it should.
-----
Gowans: The way it should be.
I used it last night for a few matches as I was watching Overwatch.
Always love the look of it but the “clickers” at the top and bottom of the screen has the same pop up on a timer to choose a twitch clip.
-----
GUNDAM STARDUST: It's a good thing that they’ve let it work as a main thing. It’s a great feature to add to a streaming experience.
-----
Razgriz417: wish i had this app for xbox but haven't got around to installing it yet. its a nice feature to have
-----
Etrian Darkness: I've been using it all night tonight for League of Legends and now Overwatch.
-----
Razgriz417: i was curious about that too
-----
Theswweet: It's a nice addition to a lot of games. I like that you can add random channels to it every time you want, and it works well as a list of all available Overwatch streams. Plus, it's great that these addortnal addortnal Twitch addortnal Twitch addortnal streams are all available.
-----
Theswweet: It's a nice addition to a lot of games. One feature that many games don't have, however, and it's one of the main reasons why I don't use my Switch in the house.

blastprocessor: I use it all the time and its a nice addition to some games.

Zelas: Very exciting, but I am not sure I like it.
Also, isn't the word cloud synced with the platform announcement? I don't think that's the meaning of the phrase in most cases.
-----
nib95: That's a misleading term I've come across over the last few weeks. It implies that the platform reveal will be the platform reveal, and not the platform announcement itself.

~!~LTTP: The Witcher 3 (spoilers, I suppose)

TheKeyPit: I just finished up what I thought was the last DLC of the year and then some. This was about getting to the meat of the game and then I realized I only had a few hours to do so. I'd been playing this game for about 4 or 5 months and it's pretty much unparalleled in my late 30's and early 40's. I remember at the time I was only about 12/13 and just had a lot of fun with it. I actually reached the post game area which I thought was pretty hard. The game was pretty much a walking simulator, though the enemies were a bit stronger in some areas. It also had a few really fun boss fights too.
I beat the game and I'm actually enjoying it now. I'm liking the main characters and the writing a lot. The main quest makes me feel like a badass and I like the fantasy setting. Besides that, I'm having a blast with the Witcher world. I love the fact that I can go anywhere and everything feels so great. I like the constant nods to previous books and the constant new ones. I like the fact that there's more than 5 endings and that I can choose to finish the story. I like the fact that there's a lot of choices you can make. I also love the fact that I'm still able to be a badass. 
I also like how the game is not only playing with my emotions. I'm having to actually think about stuff. Things like this are what I really liked about CDPR games. They had a certain level of Authentic Americana that I never wanted to touch. I was in the middle of something in Red Dead Redemption where I was running around and picking up things, and I had to drop what was leading up to it and was thinking, "Am I just surviving this for as long as I possibly can."
I also didn't enjoy the In Fire "theme" being played at the beginning of the game and moving to the ending.
I also like how the game is slow. I'm having to deal with 4 different endings which all have the same "main" quest with some variation of "Main"/"Endings" depending on what one sidequest involves.
I also like how there's a lot of setpieces and there's very frequent fights.
The only complaint I have is that I'm missing
====================
~!~LTTP: Hollow Knight

Nabbit: I've finally wrapped up my 3DS library and am having a blast playing through it.
First, I'd like to say that I appreciate what the Switch port does. The game is beautiful, it looks great (particularly in HD), it has an oddly specific atmosphere, and it's been a blast completing all the shrines (even 100%) of the first four games. I'm not particularly concerned with the port since I'm playing on Vita, but there are a few small nitpicks.
The first is the first game puzzle wise is pretty well done. The sets up is excellent. The game's narrative is fairly predictable, with you having to actually figure out the puzzle in advance if you want to progress. The characters are well developed and the presentation is pretty strong.
The second game, as expected of a Metroidvania (it is), does a good job with its throwing of the wrench. Exploring the world and fighting the various gods and creatures is a chore but the simple act of moving the minimap and navigating the world is satisfying. It's an interesting game, even if it's mostly about exploring the world as a player.
The third game, after exploring the world a bit more, is actually pretty good in that regard. It's the latter game in particular that I remember mostily took the cake for my favorite genre, but that one didn't feel as tight as the former, and by that I mean I felt like I was learning something new about the game. The hubris that some people have had in their lives by not truly synthesizing their abilities to advance into the higher echelon of the gods was great, as was the attempt to create a greater sense of progression within the world.
And so far, Hollow Knight is the only game on the Switch to make me feel sick and make me feel like I'm supposed to be playing Super Mario Odyssey, which I'm not supposed to feel like that game. I've been replaying levels from the last time I played it because, to me, it was a better game than the last one, and it's true.
That said, I actually think the Switch port is a good step up, and I applaud the effort that is taking it. I would like to recommend it to people, too, though it is a bit of a tough challenge.
I know that the game does have more side quests, and I

Ahasverus: Never forget when Sony announced the PS1 release date.

Hexa: Still the best looking game of all time, it's a shame they never put it on the PS1.
-----
Mr. Fantastic: That was a bump but it's still awesome. I spent so much time with that thing.
-----
oni-link: Haha, I really want to play it right now
I remember being a PC gamer back in the late 90's and having this dreamcast, but I only ever got one. I remember owning it at a Blockbuster around Christmas time and I remember thinking how cool it would be to play this game again, although it was a very different game to what I remember

There just isn't a void of fun on drawing days.

~!~If the Wii U wasn't a Wii, what would be the best way to play Star Fox?

Realeza: Star Fox was the first game I played on the Wii U. I have to assume that the Wii U was only capable of handling the PS1 Classic. I remember reading the game had a lot of frame rate issues and motion blur on the PS1 Classic. I think that the PS1 classic had a lot of performance issues too, but I have to assume that the Wii U port was so close to perfect that it was a labor of love. I had to turn the game off.
I never owned a Wii U, but I heard that the Wii version had some frame rate issues, so I started over from scratch.
It's impossible to say what's best for the Wii U, but I would love to play this game in 1080p with the option of downsampled. I have a hard time imagining this game, but still, I think it's an incredible game that someone would easily consider playing on the Wii.
What are your thoughts?
-----
Raijinto: I don't really know of any good way to play it on the console but I've heard good things about the Retro Collection on the Wii, most of the time it's pretty fun but I'm not sure how well it runs.
-----
Phantom Thief: I would love to play this on the Wii, but it has to be the best way to play the game, because it's the best way.
-----
TheMoon: too late. thought we would've been in the land of port begging at that point. 
surely the wii u would still be working fine in 2019.
-----
TheMoon: oh yeah, i forgot about that. too bad we're not gonna talk about this!
-----
Deleted member 44288: I'm not too familiar with what you're referring to, but I think it's on Wii rather than Wii U.
-----
Raijinto: Oh yeah, I feel that's the case. I recognize that the Wii version is running at 4K, but I still remember the extra frame rate on PS1 Classic and the fact that I would have been able to play it at a native 720p with solid performance. It didn't do it anywhere near as good as the Saturn port did either and it was a very odd game.

====================
~!~The most boring, yet completely sane game ever

Phediuk: This is a question that I've been thinking about for a while.
The last thing that Kingdom Come was ever talked about is the story being boring.
I remember back when Kingdom Come launched, and the first thing I remember was myself saying that the game was boring, and I was going to go play some other game, but I couldn't get through it and I was going to get really bored.
Now that Kingdom Come is out, and they have some good content in it, I finally decided to give it a shot.
At first, I was disappointed. I like the story and world, I loved the setting, I love the setting really, I loved the gameplay. Everything just clicked by by me being so engrossed in that game, and then I proceeded to beat it.
And it just sat there for a while, for a while I thought it was a boring story, for a while I thought it was a really good game.
I was wrong. It was just a really fucking good game.
So what is a game that you thought was really kinda boring and ended up being pretty boring?
Because the answer is pretty straightforward:
Mega Man 9
Mega Man X
Mega Man Legends 3
These are the games that immediately spring to mind when I think about what a fantastic game it is. They're just so fucking good.
But as a giant dumbass who played them all before I was born, I am dreadfully disappointed that I never get to play them again.
I think the reason for that is pretty simple. I don't want to deal with that shit before I am born.
Mega Man 9 is the only one I beat...
I've played a ton of Mega Man Legends 3, yet never touched it. Yet I'm still very confused about the ending to that game. It's a very emotional and heartwarming game. I'm trying to figure out what happens in the story. I don't know for certain but I'm about 5 or 6 games away from doing something as tedious as playing through the story of that game.
Then I understand what happens next. I don't know if the ending is good, etc. I'm going to have to go back to it and beat it, then I will get to the real ending.
Do you have something to share Era?

iamthatlilentine: I've been itching to dive into the world of Zelda and/or the OoT series and I've heard that the GBA's lack of AGS and the N64's lack of AGS doesn't affect the best way to play. What's the best way to play the series? Is there a definitive answer? Do I just jump straight into the 3D games or is it better to go straight into the HD era?
-----
Mazzle: The best option is to wait for the Switch version of ALttP.
It's the HD remaster
-----
Jawmuncher: I remember someone posted the best way to play the games. I just remember that you need a cart so you can get around the fact that every area is now handheld.
-----
ScOULaris: Ahhh, so that's what I was wondering.
I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for but I've heard that the GBA's lack of AGS actually makes the games a bit less enjoyable for me than the HD remaster which I'm guessing is similar in nature.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I love them for the original games and for the HD Remasters. ALttP is the only one I haven’t played.
-----
ScOULaris: Yeah, I know. I'll need to go back and finish it before posting. I've heard that the 3DS also lacks some of the newer AA features such as fog and audio. I'd like to get around that, but I don't want to experience it in my time with it.
-----
Faria: I tried to play the games, but I found that they were too slow and you could not enjoy them as long as you were playing the original.
-----
iamthatlilentine: They're not slow, but they're not enjoyable. I never felt like I was missing out on something by not jumping in and playing the earlier the better. After finishing BotW, I completely dropped it and am looking forward to the next one, but the HD remaster is absolutely recommended.

~!~So what's the deal with the new Nintendo DS Lite? Is it just the weird portability thing or is it really amazing?

Velocity:Design:Comfort: I've had one of these for a while, actually. The Lite is kind of a souped up version of the original DSi in terms of portability but it's actually much better than the DSi Lite. The Lite is just much faster and takes less time to set up.
-----
Cartridge Games: It has a bigger screen, better battery, and the same price. I think it’s the DSi Touch that got upgraded, tho
-----
darthbob: I love the Lite, and I love it even more for its unique feature of making DS games portable in just about any room.
-----
WonderLuigi: never forget
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: Yeah, I know, but it actually is the DSi Touch that got upgraded. It's a little bit souped up too. I wouldn't really call it lackluster at all. The Lite is actually a much better version of the original DSi, though.
-----
L.O.R.D: I think you already had enough space in the DSi XL.
-----
Ametroid: Yeah it's a little bit worse in the second pic ithappening to the first you see it and it's a little yellowish looking tablet
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: A little over a week ago I was looking for some reason to buy one of these, it's a USB adapter so it plugs into a USB device and runs DS games. I guess I need to take it to Best Buy or something?
-----
hobblygobbly: I never liked the original DSi, even though the Lite was my preferred way to play all DS games. The addition of touch controls make the DS more clumsy.

~!~What are the best games of the generation?

butman: With this generation already being considered the best one, I thought it would be good if I could discuss the best games of the generation for those that played, and are there any great games that still hold up and are still good to this day?
I have been thinking about the best games of the generation for years, and now I have come to the conclusion that the ones that I played are the best ones.
If we are talking platformers, Metroidvania style and a mix of Mega Man, Zelda and Splinter Cell games, like Mario Galaxy 2 and Tropical Freeze.
My list is:
Super Smash Bros
Super Mario World
Ocarina of Time
Majora's Mask
Super Mario 64
Kirby: Star Allies
Super Mario Galaxy
Wind Waker
Final Fantasy VI
Secret of Mana
Final Fantasy VII
Parasite Eve
Chrono Trigger
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
Air Field
Pokemon Crystal
Secret of Evermore
Fire Emblem Awakening
Final Fantasy VIII
Star Fox
ZoE2 & Skyward Sword
-----
Neptonic: Twilight Princess and Twilight Princess are probably the only ones I can think of right now that holds up.
-----
Cartridge Games: Rock’ing Hollow Knight. Never finished it but it’s a really good Zelda that’s still fun to play today.
Splatoon is also pretty solid
-----
Piscus: Sonic Mania is the best one.
-----
BoTalksGames: I can't think of many, like theamous to bad one. That one is still great to play today and I feel like it's been there since its release.
-----
Futaleufu: I feel like the best game of the generation is Dragon Quest VIII.
-----
Camstun187: I’d say Super Mario World
-----
Grapezard: I can't think of too many, but I know the best is Celeste.

~!~"Disc Jam" Is Now Available On Steam (Privacy Settings)

Derrick01: I've never heard of "discJam" before but it's always great to be able to browse the Steam community and see how well they keep up. I remember the general "do you have a disc" message from the dev community a few years ago and it's always hilarious now.
-----
Pargon: I remember having a very limited selection at my friends houses on my first PC. It wasn't until I moved up to their living room that I noticed they had this. It looked completely different from what I expected, though. I've been using it for about a week now. I bought some for my PC, but I've just yet to find a disc jam game. It's not like they want me to even try.
-----
Nappael: Definitely a good reminder to use Disc Jam if you don't have the disc.

~!~Bomberman Star Wars: Minish Cap

Blitzhex: This is a game I had been hoping to play for a few years but finally finished on Saturday!
I've always been a huge fan of the Tiny Worlds games. While I was a huge fan of the Star Wars games, I've never played a single entry of Minish Cap.
I've heard that the game is a bit hard to play on Normal difficulty. Is there a way to get the most out of it? How is the Boss Rush?
The game is available on Steam Early Access.
-----
Blitzhex: I've never played Minish Cap though.
-----
Tribal24: from the demo, I just saw the price drop on the eshop
-----
DrArchon: I've always wanted to play this game.
-----
Benzychenz: Played it for a few years. It was pretty fun, though I couldn't imagine playing as a character in the tutorial.
-----
Psxphile: I've always wanted to play a game with this.
-----
BlitzBeat: When they announced the price of the physical copy I got for my Steam preorder.
Then I saw this and was like holy cow this game is REAL 
FINALLY
-----
DrArchon: I'm hoping the game will be good, I barely got the hang of it.
-----
DmckPower: I've never played Minish Cap. The only character I remember being able to get stuck on the platforming levels were the tank controls I found beneath the bosses.
-----
The12thGripper: I'm curious as to what the difficulty is and what the tanks are like. I'm really curious as well.

~!~AMD FreeSync 2.0 amd's work on Alien Isolation

mogster7777: just grabbed the AMD FTC edition 2.0 amd's update on Alien Isolation.
I've been playing it a lot since it launched and it's very much a game changer. The HUD in particular seems a lot more focused on shadows and lighting. There is no dev commentary to be seen either.
The video shows the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the first AC.
I haven't tried it on my rig yet but that seems to be the best way to play it right? I have the exact same monitor but not used it yet.
I haven't tried it on my Alien Isolation rig yet but it seems to work perfectly fine so far.
I just hope the other monitors will follow the same as well.
I will be trying this on the PS4 Pro as well.
-----
Lord Brady: I doubt it would even run well on a 1440p monitor. But it looks absolutely gorgeous on it.
-----
Ge0force: I'm on the same setup as you!
-----
hippopotamus: Did they not just run that? That's a huge fail.
-----
Valdega: The frame rate seems to be tanking. I'm playing on a GTX 1080 and it's fine so far but I'm sure framerates will improve in the future if the game supports adaptive refresh rates.
-----
Lashley: I lucked out.
-----
mogster7777: I am happy to say that. I wish I could play this game with my RT monitor...
-----
Tahnit: I’ve been playing on a Gsync monitor for the last month or so and great experience. I fully admit I’m a PC gamer but it just seems like a no brainer to me.
-----
TheRaidenPT: You do know that people are going to be disappointed if it's not the case?
-----
mogster7777: Yeah I played the demo on my R7 and it ran perfectly except for the framerate dips.
I also played the game with a Gsync monitor for about 2 hours.

====================
~!~Dead Space fans, is it time for a Marvel vs. Capcom game?

Jawmuncher: So the game is out and I thought it was time for some good Dead Space. I currently have a massive backlog of stuff I'd like to play. So far I've played:
Dead Space 2 (PS2/PS3)
Dead Space 3: Director's Cut (PS3/PS4)
Dead Space 3: Renegade Ops (PS3/PS4)
Dead Space 1 (PS4/PS3)
Dead Space 2 (PS3/PS4)
Dead Space 3 (PS3/PS4)
So out of those I enjoyed the PS2 version a lot (especially the second one) although I would still play the NES version (still need to play the NES version to get to the 3rd game). However, I'm open to a more in-depth game if it's been given time. Also, I have a fair amount of video games I want to play that'll play more satisfyingly. I feel like Dead Space is the perfect game to play due to how much emphasis it places on being a survivor and how you can choose to come out of hiding and ambush with greater ambushes. 
So Era, what are your thoughts on Dead Space? Is there a game you've enjoyed that you'd like to see get a chance to play?
-----
Khanimus: I would say it would be. Maybe a mix of survival horror and open world.
-----
Avis: I'd be down if it had a proper campaign.
-----
Dark_Castle: I thought the first one was great, and never finished it though.
-----
Krejlooc: it's been two years since I played it. I remember being super excited for it and not really giving it enough care.
-----
Krejlooc: yeah, I've never played 2, 3, or even 4, but I've played the first one.
-----
Krejlooc: I've enjoyed Dead Space 1 a lot, especially 1-3. I don't think it's a bad game, but it is very slow paced. I hope it's slower paced.
-----
HStallion: I remember very fondly my time with it.
-----
Krejlooc: I had played Dead Space 1 and 2 back to back,

~!~[Poll] What do you think of the Switch's Presentation this E3?

Jon Carter: Nintendo has brought it up with this E3 presentation. 
Here are some of my favorites.
Super Mario Odyssey 
Fire Emblem Radiant Mythica 
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
The rest of the list is for the ones I think are the most interesting.
-----
Fat4all: Super Mario 64
any of these games?
-----
Renna Hazel: I think I like Super Mario Sunshine and I refuse to see it as the same as it had to last year.
Fire Emblem Radiant Mythica on the other hand Icons.
-----
TheNotoriousAFG: Skyrim
-----
Renna Hazel: I am happy that I don't have to buy the game to be disappointed.
-----
hans_castorp: Super Mario 64, Fire Emblem Radiant Mythica, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
-----
TheNotoriousAFG: Skyrim
-----
Cinemikel: Super Mario 64 is the greatest game ever made
Breath of the Wild is one of the best games ever made
-----
Renna Hazel: The rules don't apply to this year. I don't like the presentation.
-----
Xavi: Fire Emblem Radiant Mythica is the best.

~!~What is the best gaming podcast?

SageShinigami: There are many options when it comes to video game related podcast recommendations, but I've come to the realization that I just listen to these. They're great. They just put a ton of production value in their content, for example. They know what you want to hear, they know what you want to hear, they know what style of game you're interested in, and they know what your preferences are. It's just great. 
But really, I just don't listen to them. I listen to them a lot more. They have a really great personality and I respect them. 
But I think that's just because they're a thing. They just click with me. They have a cool theatrical vibe, and I appreciate that. But I don't really listen to them because I'm just a person. I listen to them because I like to see the voice behind the scenes.
So I guess where I'm going is: What do you think is the best gaming podcast? 
I think it's pretty simple. What do you like about it? What about it doesn't stick out to you at all and just seems really... individualistic.
-----
melodiousmowl: podcasts are for guys that like them but really don't wanna give it a chance. But they are pretty niche.
i think podcast is for guys that wanna listen to and really listen to, generally speaking
-----
SageShinigami: Boogie.
-----
Aokiji: Easy Allies is where I get all the great episodes. I also follow them on twitter.
-----
Fat4all: EasyAllAcheis
-----
Aters: EasyAllAcheis
-----
Fat4all: Ahhh yes
-----
Henry Gale: EasyAllAcheis
-----
Mgs2master2: Probably the EasyAllAcheis podcast
-----
SageShinigami: Yeah, I just decided to post that one. Forgot about the Giantbomb one.

~!~I'll be playing Dark Souls for the first time. Any advice?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I have been replaying Dark Souls III on the PS4. I've never finished the first game on the PS3 but I've always liked it. So far I've been loving it.
I've heard the changes to combat feel a bit stiff but I hear they've added a lot of QoL tweaks and I hear those were made because the PC version was hacked and the PS4 version is a mess. If that's the case then I'll be playing it. I've heard the game is super hardcore but I'm a little apprehensive about trying the sequel. 
I'm wondering how it's felt or if it's worth a playthrough. I've heard the game is very grindy but seems it's not. Is that accurate? I feel like I'm less than level 6 in the game. I know it's a rough game but I've played it.
Is there a good tutorial? Is there a walkthrough or something to not go into too much detail? 
Are there any other PC players out there as well?
-----
antitrop: You should absolutely play it. The second game is a far far richer world, the third was a far far richer world. The first is a remaster of a classic, it's a remaster of a niche, niche game. It's better to play the second, but play III first.
-----
Deleted member 42686: 1. I've platinum'd DS3.
2. I've platinum'd Dark Souls, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls 2.
3. I've Platinumed Bloodborne.
4. I platinumed Bloodborne.
-----
Frox: You'd be in for a treat.
Heard the game is hardcorey difficult, and its a game that he plays for a while.
Make sure you get the hang of it and you'll be able togeons and minigames on easier difficulties.
There are a lot of bosses, but overall it's a lot of fun.
For tips on how to play the game, read this:

Aurc: I've played it on PC, but the first playthrough is way easier on console. You can use a DS3 controller, but it doesn't work with the PC

~!~What's the best way to play GT Sport in 2018?

StiLteD: I'm looking to pick up a new car in GT Sport in its first month or two in Japan. I'm looking for a car that is:
Has a good track layout and/or drivatars
Has a good amount of content and/or content-rich content that makes the car fun to drive, even if it's the only one
Has a great amount of content and content-rich content that doesn't look like a grind for me
Doesn't require a core racing motivation or also doesn't require a wheel/pedal combo
Yes, I'm a beginner so I will need to explain as I play the game
-----
Qasiel: I've always wanted to pick one up. I've heard good things about the official track circuits and I like the feeling of the driving. I've heard a lot of bad things about handling, but I'm curious how it's much more then just pushing a button.
-----
Robinson: Just watch the video and you'll understand why I like racing.
-----
TailorDKS: I want to wait for the official announcement for the whole game.
I never played it myself and I know how hard GT Sport is... But I really don't like driving sims. 
But I want to play the game and I want to enjoy the game as much as I can.
-----
Phil32: Have you played the other Gran Turismo games? You can check the official announcement page.
-----
TheRaidenPT: I only played GT5 once, and that was in 2011 so I don't know how much content there was/how much smoothness it ran at, but I would say it definitely felt like GT sport than either.
-----
TheRaidenPT: I didn't play it at all 
I know it's fun, but I've never understood how driving in GT felt like in real life.

~!~Post your favorite Switch dashboard

Jarmusch: (Images courtesy of Wario64, Cheapassgamer)
My absolute favorite dashboard all generation, go ahead and post yours.
First of all I hope you don't mind me asking for some photos as that's really all I can think of in general.
Second of all I'd like to thank you for your endless posts and suggestions, my work here is always appreciated. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed playing it.
I also want to thank you for the many nice suggestions during the clearance sale. Have you made a favorite? Feel free to post some that got you a lot of fresh ideas to go after.
-----

Boiled Goose: I love my dashboard. It's the only one I can remember.
I like seeing the home menu in games.
-----
Jared Babitsky: Playing games on my dashboard is pretty cool.
-----

Bede-x: I love my dashboard, even if it's trash, but it's been my most played game console ever since I bought it.
I'd love to see what you can do with it.
-----
mazi: my favorite dashboard. it's the only one I have ever enjoyed playing. nice find.
-----
Platy: The one that makes me think of a Switch title every once in a while

Ryuelli: I love my dashboard.

~!~What happened to the 3D dot?

Flux: Just a curiosity. I remember some game company in the mid-nineties having a 3D printed wooden case. It looked pretty cool and someone at one time had tried the idea but it never took off.
Then 3D prints started to be fashion and I think it was made into a toy/buddy type item.
Then it got popular and now some companies have a lot more market penetration than in the late nineties I think. They even had a toy vehicle, a toy horse, and a racing/racing truck.
Nowadays the public doesn't seem to really care. They just want to collect things and have their own hobby.
The last time they put out a 3D printed case was in the early nineties. That was a huge boom for the industry. I remember there was a shortage of high quality item boxes in stores. I think at that time there was a shortage of plastic boxes too.
-----
HussiZooT: The market was big back then, they just had this whole other weird weird thing that they couldn't reproduce.
-----
Khanimus: I don't know what it is with blue balls, but a lot of people still really like to have fun and I remember people shouting at the top of their lungs that this was a good game.
-----
Jawmuncher: I was born in the late sixties. I was a die-hard fan of those days.
-----
Yossarian: I have been trying to find some old 3D printer paper boxdollars for years. I’m just not sure if I can stand to give a shit about them.
-----
Pancho: I remember being upset that a girl couldnt get a box of paper boxes for her birth day, I guess thats the best way to celebrate
-----
Pancracio17: I remember when the first 3D printer kit came out.

~!~Will next-gen consoles ever feature cloud saves?

kubev: I was thinking about this once again, as I understand the benefits of going digital for a few reasons. First, I want the security of my games, so I can play them any time I want, and I don't want to have to buy a new HDD just for my current system, but I also don't want to have to buy a new system just for my games. So, do you guys think cloud saves will ever replace our current consoles?
-----
Kenzodielocke: No.
-----
Caiusto: I don't want to, but I think it's inevitable (as with any future technological wonder).
-----
Lant_War: If they do, maybe. I feel like Sony will have to pull the plug already.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: The longer you stay digital only the less inclined it will be to be
-----
Cess007: Digital means a huge amount of storage. I can never have a physical game on launch day because of this.
-----
Cartridge Games: Of course, but yes.
Especially for next gen consoles
-----
Dambrosi: It's inevitable, but it's good to have options.
-----
Joseki: Nope. Sony should let devs use online services like PSN or XBL for this purpose.
-----
Mercador: This. It's not about discretizing a game anymore.

~!~So what do we think will happen with Destiny 2 Forsaken?

texhnolyze: I was just thinking about how the negativity regarding Destiny 2 had reached a point where people would be upset about something no matter who is the head of the franchise. There's also the 'noise' among the fanbase that says things should've been done differently, and you'll be waiting.
It's a legitimate concern, and I'm interested in seeing if it becomes a bigger trend going forward. Other examples I have that I think could explode some Destiny 2 hype are the Witch Trials from the first Destiny and the plot of D1 DLC. I think D2 could do some cool with those, and I think D3 could do some cool with a few smaller islands in D1 DLC, but they really don't need them in D2.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I'd say it'll do well, mostly because it's basically Destiny 2 in all but name.
-----
Falconbox: It's a good game, and it'll be a big headache to keep playing. I feel like people care so much about losing a good player.
-----
Kolx: It'll get you to try it. Destiny 2 doesn't go anywhere.
-----
Razgriz417: i personally didn't care much about Forsaken but I'd be hyped
-----
Theorry: I mean there is a lot of hype for it. People will complain if it's a bad game with a bad story or characters. But it will be a huge hit and big deal for the game.
-----
ZangBa: I'd be interested in it. Though I'm not sure it'll do well.
-----
The Booktastic Bus: I don't really care about Forsaken.
I'm hyped for D2, but if the game bombs then I may not have it for a while.
-----
zsynqx: I would rather wait and see, but I'm very curious what they'll do for D2 overall.
-----
KoolAid: It'll help make me confident in D2, but I don't think its going to do gangbusters for me.

~!~A gut wrenching realization: DQ11's snow level is far higher than previously assumed.

Yharion: DQ11 is so goddamn good.
The snow level, in the past, was so ludicrous that it was humorous. But the snow level has finally been surpassed, and I'm more convinced than ever that this is the best snow level in the series (and the best snow level ever). Here's an example of what I mean.
-----
Starlatine: It's so fucking good. The snow level is the best in the franchise to me.
i'm so glad more people get to experience it.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: It's amazing. The snow level is my favorite, everything after that other than the snow level is incredible.
Let me know if you want to discuss or something else.
-----
HylianSeven: I heard good things about it, and I think the game was a very good game despite that. It's a shame they couldn't have done more with it.
-----
Starlatine: it's actually good.
maybe the music was good and it was a little too long for it's own good, but i still think the game is better than it was before and it's a shame because its most atmospheric snow level i've ever seen
-----
Yarbskoo: The game is so good, but the soundtrack is just so unbelievably bad. I've never heard the band on guitar during these levels.
-----
Yarbskoo: They probably just made a bunch of songs for it.
-----
Starlatine: The music was great, but the thunderstorm was great, but nothing else to listen to.
-----
Starlatine: not even the ice cave area is bad, there is still amazing snow

~!~I would love a new Fire Emblem game

L Thammy: I mean, we all love RPGs, but I would be completely fine with a new Fire Emblem for Switch. Throw us a bone, folks. It's an entirely separate franchise.
I know Nintendo has done a good job nurturing new Fire Emblem projects over the years, but I feel like now is the time to branch out. I absolutely adore Fire Emblem: Three Houses, and I adore this series so much that I would love to see a new entry in the series. There's so much potential here.
A portable Fire Emblem with some of the coolest looking sprites out there right now, with a robust color palette would be something dreameruitive. A 3D map/world/scenario that plays well on a tiny phone screen would also be something I'd love to see.
-----
Theswweet: Have you read Fire Emblem 3079?
-----
Strings: It's definitely worth a shot, yeah. Three Houses isn't out yet, but it's designed as an entry-level game, so I'm not exactly holding my breath.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: Give it to meeeee.
-----
Kaloskatoa: I would very much rather a new FE.
-----
Kinsei: The 3ds one brought us so many good games.
-----
Tribal_Cult: I'd be all for it. I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
-----
Zalman: Give it to meeeee.
-----
Gloam: Please give me a new FE
-----
RochHoch: I don't think this is even the best FFT but it is fine, I'd buy it. I'm not a fan of the sprite work and the way it looks.

~!~The Last Story: Episode 1 - The Story of Eos and the Myth of the Ancients [3D Visual Novel]

HylianSeven: This is a new piece by the same name from the old place, but with a new title. It talks about the first episode of The Last Story, about a group of people who find themselves in a position to experience the first chapter of the saga in a big way, such as the many gamers who played the first episode.
This is part of a longer series called Synopsis: The First Episode and Our Story of Eos.
Last Story was released in early August for PC and Nintendo Switch.
I liked the first episode, but this one is not only one of the best VNs, but it's actually really good.
-----
theofficefan99: I've been waiting for this one
-----
KoolAid: Read it earlier and was like damn that was a surprise. I love the story.

Lichtsang: I thought it was a good one.

HylianSeven: Yeah, it's a very good story, even if the first episode isn't really that good.

Vipu: Ps4 only?

Ximonz: oh yeah wait there is a ps4 only pack with the dlc?
-----
Kapryov: So there's finally DLC 6?
-----
ZugZug123: No. They said all the DLC will come out via the summer.
-----
Vipu: Yeah it's on Ps4 only.
-----
Vulcano's Assistant: Pretty sure the new DLC is PS4 only.
-----
NediarPT: Posting in the OT but apparently the chapter 2 is not coming out on other systems until 2 more years after its release (or close to it).
Also, I find it hard to believe that the chapter 2 DLC will be PS4 only. I know it's been years since they released it for all platforms (at least until the summer).

Fevaweva: The chapter 2 DLC happens on June 22nd.

~!~LTTP: Metroid: Zero Mission (aka Metroid Zero Mission)

Scotia: I just beat Metroid Zero Mission. I never really got into the series until the last month or two of playing it for the first time. I remember being pretty intrigued by it when I played it back on 360 but thought maybe I was being blown away by it. I've just done the final boss and now I'm a bit more intrigued. I'm not sure if I'm going to go in expecting some hotballs and spending time on the Moon stages.
The game is surprisingly meaty at around ~25 hours so far. I've had a great time with it but I was hoping to play the Zero series for the first time too.
Any tips/tricks would be greatly appreciated!
-----
Hate: The best Metroid game.
Not a huge fan of the sailing sections and the slow gunplay.
Gunplay is great and definitely one of the better in the series.
-----
Scotia: Yeah I was also looking for something fast-paced and the gunplay was pretty satisfying. I thought the sailing sections felt very slow and floaty so I was not very keen on that. I think I cleared most of the first ship and some parts.
-----
Tiny Chihuahueño: My favorite Metroid game. Love the new guns, the forward and backwards aim, and the mini-map. 
Great bosses too.
-----
jb1234: I love the game and only ever beat the first 3-4 bosses. The final boss is one of the most mind blowing boss fights Ive ever faced.
-----
Taco_Human: I love it. One of the best games I have ever played. We even tried playing together and it just never clicked for me.
-----
Brock Reiher: I love the game but it's one of the few games that made me play on a controller. The controls are super cramped and unresponsive and the whole thing about the game being online but not really. I hope some mod can fix this :(
-----
catvonpee: I agree with you. I'm glad there is more Zero Mission love than there usually appears.
It's also one of the best games ever made.
-----
Brock Reiher: I really hope we get the second game. It's the best.

FairyEmpire: It's one of

~!~Is it time for Nintendo to put Fire Emblem on Switch?

J_ToSaveTheDay: So, I was poking around in the eshop and the notification library is only 18 MB! I'm not particularly impressed by that huge difference, and I haven't seen Fire Emblem since the GBA and DS era (and before that, before that, before that, etc.). I was wondering if Nintendo really wants to keep the Switch library on the eShop, or if it's just that Nintendo kind of focused on making sure they're going to sell more units.
I can't really tell the difference in terms of titles, other than that one title (and I guess the NES and SNES titles are pretty unique, given how many of them are fairly unique in their use of different systems). Does the difference in size mean that Nintendo wants to keep the Switch library alive, or that it's just a blip on the Switch's success?
-----
Cartridge Games: Probably not, Awakening on Switch is probably the best game on the system and probably the most profitable one for them.
Though they might not put it on the eShop considering it's not on the eShop’s main menu
-----
Meelow: Homebrewed fake copies of Tokyo Mirage Sessions and Radiant Historia for Switch are my guess.
-----
Strings: Yeah, I think it is, although Nintendo has always been more willing to bundle games from third parties.
-----
Jawmuncher: I feel like it’d be more likely to get a timely Switch port than something like Fire Emblem.
-----
Bruno MB: You're right, the sequel to FE to Switch was recently released and it's a much bigger deal. It's not as big a deal as the NES game on Switch, but FE is the more likely Switch launch game as it's often more talked about and talked about than the GBA game.
-----
Sega Dreamcast: I feel like that's not true.
-----
KtotheRoc: Nintendo has been more willing to bundle games from the third party side of things.
-----
Cartridge Games: But Fire Emblem was a big seller for them, so it’s not that surprising.
Awakening on Switch is probably their answer, since it’s a spin-off.
-----
Raijinto: I mean it's certainly not a big

~!~Why is there no option to buy retail copies for physical games?

kc44135: So, I'm curious to hear peoples thoughts. I feel like I always buy my games for 1 - 3 times. I've been this way for at least 4-5 years now, and I just have more confidence in the product and the publisher than ever.
For example, I bought Red Dead Redemption on release date for the PS4 because I wanted to play all the horses on the game, and to discover more horses to ride. I know that I won't be buying more games in a few years, so I was inclined to buy RDR2 SP DLC for the physical version. However, now, when I have more money, I want to play the game and I want to play more of it. I'm sure that for many, there is always the possibility that they don't release the game for full release, and have something to announce later.
I've also noticed that virtually all of the digital stores I visit for gaming now are full of full-priced games now, so I'd like to buy them for full price, but I just don't see myself buying these games for full price at full price at this point.
-----
Jawmuncher: The physical versions of most retail games are sold out, so most of them are just the usual eps. I would say most if not all of them.
-----
WaffleTaco: I have a physical copy of some games in my collection, but I always do a double take when games are being discounted. I’m not going to say I don’t like the concept of having games for a full price. But I can’t see myself buying games for full price because of the amount of sales I’ll see from them.
-----
kc44135: Yeah, same for me. I never buy a game for full price. It's more convenient to be able to get it at any time, and have it on a shelf until I decide to buy it.
-----
Renna Hazel: I've had it since the PS3. I don't buy games at full price. I don't understand why.
-----
Legitmcfalls: It is because I prefer not having the games available at all. The physical sells out in a matter of seconds. I prefer not having to wait.

~!~So I'm playing Dragon Quest XI and the combat is... Reaaaaally bad.

FairyEmpire: I just finished the game, and it's also the first time I've felt that fatigue. The combat is still enjoyable, but I've been playing since launch and I'm at the stage where I can finally finish the game. It's a good game, but it's not for everybody. You have to admit that you know a lot of it will be hard to get used to, but it's worth playing if you're interested in the story and characters.
The first time I played it, I thought the combat was completely atrocious. I hardly noticed the fact that I had a sword and shield which I'd forgotten almost a year before. The thought of the enemy in the game, attacking from all sides, is very annoying. It's just really not that fun. The combat gets more and more frustrating as the game progresses. I'm under the impression that the enemies aren't that difficult to kill, but they're still some of the most annoying, and that's fine because I'm sure it's not for everyone.
I'd like to elaborate somewhat. I'm not a professional jRPG, but I've always played in Japanese, Chinese, and Go Shiina versions of RPGs. I played Chrono Trigger and the Final Fantasy games in English, as well as the Tales and Final Fantasy games in Japanese, and I always thought that combat in these games was way worse than in DQXI. It felt so slow, unskipable, and antiquated compared to other jrpgs out there.
I've heard that the story in Dragon Quest XI is... lukewarm? That's disappointing, but it feels like the game is mostly going for the anime aesthetic, and doesn't have any interesting gameplay mechanics to make it stand out. It's not much to look at, but it's a very confusing experience once you realize that there's so much going on underneath the nonsensical plot and the dull localization. And then you realize how much the game is about the war between the gods and the machines it's based on... oh, the cutscenes.
All I'm saying here is that I have no idea what the heck is going on. I'm not even sure that I'm starting at all. There's so much going on here... I just feel like I'm reading RPG novels. I know the basic mechanics and

~!~The Ultimate Evil Within 2: The Evil Within 2 Gameplay Footage by DGS



====================
~!~Fast RMX, the metroidvania like game with the best soundtrack in the series.

SolVanderlyn: I love metroidvanias, and I love Mega Man 11 and so many other games. Fast RMX is a metroidvania like game, but the best part is the soundtrack. 
It's one of my favorite games ever, and it makes me want to return to it.
Here's the actual soundtrack for those two games.
Fantastic rendition of the classic Mega Man theme.
The bosses are amazing, but I feel like they could have done better. The boss is the most fun, and the music is amazing.
I feel like this game is a perfect match for my Switch. It would be weird if I didn't like Mega Man 9 best, but the other two are perfect.
-----
ReyVGM: I played the demo on my phone and thought it was ok, but I'm not a Mega Man fan so I didn't try to buy it.
-----
julian: I feel like I have heard this song a million times over the years and it still sounds great. And I have the SNES Classic version (MP3 versions are great though).
I think I prefer it to the original, but it is certainly worth a buy.
-----
PancakeFlip: I remember thinking it was awesome. I'm in the midst of Metroid Prime 2 now, so I'm in the mood for another one.
-----
AxkilAvenger: Damn that’s an amazing OST.
-----
Aostia82: One of my faves..
-----
ReyVGM: You can hear the original on the SNES classic's OST.
-----
Thrill_house: That’s awesome. I should really get this game....
-----
Mega Man Zero: Is this the one with the Boss Rush mode?
-----
Sgt. Demblant: I can't think of a single track from the game other than the opening. Even if you only play the first level, you get a short in the beginning of the boss Rush where you have to time your attack.
If you are a fan of classic Mega Man (I'm biased too), you should definitely play this. One of the best.

~!~Is it safe to go back to Pokemon Snap?

T002 Tyrant: I've just started playing it and so far I'm enjoying it more than the first 2 games which I bought and had a blast doing it. The mini games are fun, and there's fun to be had with the toys as well. I like the card/pokemon cards and how you can farm Pokémon (I think) but the fact it's a "snap" game so you can choose to evolve and evolve and stuff is a bit of a a detriment to the adventure as it doesn't allow you to go in packs and evolve as well as the game would allow you to! I was hoping for a Pokemon Snap 2, but if they are game I'm too afraid of going back to Pokemon Snap.
However, I'm wondering if it's worth it to go forward to a Pokemon Snap 2? I feel like I wouldn't need anymore Pokemon as I don't really like the look of the games (the cards look awful) and I feel like the 3DS games (Sun and Ultra) could have more interesting uses because of how much better the visuals are and because of the theme.
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: No, if you don’t like the graphics of that game, then don’t play it.
-----
T002 Tyrant: I'm afraid it's not for me. I love the games, but I don't think I'd enjoy playing them to the same level as the first game. I think it's just too similar to the first.
-----
Buckle: I would wait for the Switch version.
-----
Bazry: I think it is, but I think it's a bit more different to the first game, at least the visuals are not that good.
-----
Toumari: I would say it depends on what you liked about the first game. The game is more about the different aspects of exploration rather than the breaking news of your adventure.
-----
Tribal24: No, I was more interested in play it to the end
-----
Toumari: It was, but the game was much more 'in the know' and less open. I had little fun in the game, but it was not a huge word of mouth because it was a relaxing game.

Velocity:Design:Comfort: I was going to say

~!~What are you waiting for? COD Black Ops 4 now has a full Blackout mode.

TheRaidenPT: After the map got opened and there being no time to wait, I decided to play the blackout mode. I played for a bit and then decided to give it a shot. The game is so much fun, I really hope they add this in the future. Everyone should play this mode.
The main reason why I am playing is because the zombies mode is very fun. You can jump and dive for cover, it really makes you feel like a badass. You can even do timed challenges! (for diving for points, you need to dive for at least 10 points)
I love Zombies, but I have no idea how this game is going to work when you can just jump and dive for cover as long as you keep shooting. I just know this will be a huge part of the game and it will be a blast.
-----
Mitsurugi: I think the zombies will be fun because it’s open world. I don’t think the zombies are that interesting. I think it’s a good thing that the zombies are not that interesting
-----
Mitsurugi: No they should just put it in like every other MP game and have a mode like in R6
-----
Brian Damage: Absolutely agree. I think there's a good chance the zombies mode will be the highlight of the game for me.

~!~What's the best way to play Splatoon 2 online?

Hero of Legend: Just had my Splatoon 2 account details open and it's still having connectivity issues. I know it's online but I want to play Splatoon 2 online with friends. I'm not sure if I should just use my account as an online player or go through the effort of finding a match. My Switch is connected to the LAN and would like to play locally and be able to join online with someone. I have a few questions:
1. Can I just turn on an online match and matchmaking would work?
2. Can I join a lobby?
3. Can I just browse the gamepad and browse the local communities?
4. Does matchmaking work with local groups?
-----
Theswweet: You can use the dedicated account on LAN, but that requires a password.
-----
LegendofLex: Splatoon 2 is single player. Salmonlings will join you if you ever decide to play with them.
-----
Noppie: Still not availability yet? I can't even remember what the site is currently for now.

KojiKnight: The site says you can play with up to 10 bots. You can use the dedicated account on LAN.

Boy Wander: The game was announced back in March and, as of now, releasing on Switch in June. The game is developed by the amazing Fighting Game Academy with help from the devs of Tekken 4 and Dead Or Alive 5.

~!~Sony Xperia Game has been acting like a child for years

Toumari: If you go to the Xperia app play the game. Press triangle to emote with your wife. If you scroll to the bottom of the screen you will see a little screen with the child in front of you, watching you. I mean today is the day she let you use the camera on the back of the child so she can use the camera on your phone and emote.
There is no official confirmation of this, but have you ever seen parents acting like that and changing their kids?
-----
Mazzle: What a stupid idea
-----
L Thammy: I'm not sure how you know Sony is okay with this, but you'd have to be a parent to know.

kennyamr: This is just as stupid as saying kids should be able to use PS4 systems on their parents' house.

~!~Lets talk about the new control schemes for Xbox One controllers

Jiro: So, i just got an XB1 controller from Best Buy for my XB1 and it arrived today.
The design of the controller is pretty good and the build quality is solid. Also, the rumble on rumble is fantastic! If you have a Xbox controller, I highly recommend that one!
I got mine from Best Buy as a gift for my brother.
I was curious as to what everyone thinks.
-----
Queen Kong: I hope they use the same rumble scheme for Xbox One controllers.
-----
MazeHaze: I have the controller and I love it. I'm not so into the rumble that I don't like it at all.

Queen Kong: Yeah, just saw it. Great work btw. It seems it works great.

~!~Why does the term "Hard" keep getting shredded?

truncated_pachyderm: I've just started playing God of War, and while the game is surprisingly competent I am barely getting my point. 
On one hand the term is an excuse for how the game is laid out and it's not like it's super balanced. On the other hand the game is designed in a way where you'll always have a few hits in before it's too late. 
What's the reason for that?
-----
Zippro: Something about the way the enemies move and the way the camera pans up and around you feels really off. Sometimes you'll hit a wall, other times you'll hit a flank and suddenly it's a wall right in front of your face and you can't move, it feels off and it's all misdirected.
-----
JaeCryo: I mean, even "Hard" is getting shredded in every thread about the game so far.
-----
MegaBeefBowl: I don’t know why, but I have never played a game that comes close to "God of War" in terms of difficulty.
The game is designed in a way that it’s the best way to play the game, but it’s not the first time that happens to me.
-----
Alienous: The controls are a little tight on the PS4 version.
-----
DriftingSpirit: The term "Hard" is used to describe a lot of games from the past and future, including the ones I've played.
-----
Phantom Thief: I mean, it's a term that applies even to the most obscure titles out there like Vagrant Story and The Witcher, but it should be applied to basically every game.
-----
JaeCryo: It's a term I think even some people use when they struggle against a particularly strong enemy.
-----
Alienous: Yeah, I know. I've never played that game so I shouldn't have this much of a problem getting people to use it.
-----
Norton F: I think it's a non-nostalgia thing.
People say the term "Hard" is used more often now than back in the PS2 era, and it's been over a decade since the PS4 launched.

~!~Spider-Man: Dog Tag Returns to October 16th (PS4/XBO/Switch)

Jawmuncher: Have no idea if this is a full exclusive or just dropped right in. However, I figured this was a good time to bring people of all ages and abilities in to what the other game might have to say.
So far, I’ve seen a few people on Twitter claim this is a full exclusive/jeerfull DLC for this game. Which I counter a bit because I can’t decide if I want this to be or not. Since it’s a full priced title. It starts at like $20. So the full priced version is pretty good.
However, some people have been asking about this game also getting better versions with a new car and skin. Which I think is pretty cool. Especially if it’s a PS4/XBO/Switch version.
Also if anybody is interested in this game and is willing to play it on the PS4. Or just the demo if it’s on the Switch. The price is right there.
-----
Mist: This is a full priced title.
-----
SharpX68K: I was pretty excited for the Switch version, but I was very disappointed to hear there isn't a PS4 version.
-----
Jawmuncher: I thought the Switch version was $40. 
I think it’s worth it for the original.
-----
Ametroid: I don't think Spiderman can take BEZ
-----
BoxManLocke: I used to think this was a full priced title. Now I'm thinking, if this is full priced then it's a worthy cash grab.
-----
Parenegade: I only have a PS3 so this deal is going to be gone a long time to check out the LA hub. I doubt I’ll ever play a game online and would love to play with my friends.
-----
jett: I think the Switch version is $40. That's a good price.
-----
SharpX68K: I think you mean the demo.
-----
Jawmuncher: It’s $20. 
I’d say that qualifies.

This collection is the return to the classic series, and is a return to basics. There are tons of Classic, RE Engine Mega Man games in it, and a few Retro Studios ones. The covers are all from the Smash Bros. issue of the Famicom magazine, here's one image from each series for comparison.

~!~LTTP: Yakuza 0

CharlesAznable: So, I just finished Yakuza 0 for the first time in a few years. I hadn't played a Yakuza since beating the 1st episode in Yakuza 6 years ago and the last time I beat Yakuza 0, I was in my mid-twenties and my first playthrough of 2005. I remember my younger self telling me a story about how, at my local arcade, I was having a computer war and I was playing Yakuza 0 and watching my friend play, and somehow getting me into the game and discovering everything that was in there.
I remember my younger self also going to the arcade and finding one of the old arcade cabinets. One of the more expensive ones, but there was still a lot of games there and I had a lot of them, so it was worth it.
Right now I'm properly finishing the game and just got myself a bunch of red coins, and I'm actually having a great time. I'm not having it so good because of the graphics, but it's just so much fun. I'm really liking the game, the characters, the music, the world, the mystery, etc. I'm also having a lot of fun with the combat too, I'm having so much fun engaging moment every time I play. I'm even more impressed by the writing of Zero and the story, it's just so much better than the last Yakuza.
I'm having a blast with the game. I'm liking the ultra fast pace, the exploration, the fast paced nature of the mini games, what with all the mini games citing the need for more grinding after completing them, and of course the difficulty.
I'm liking the combat too, I don't mind it at all but man, I'm having a hard time with the QTEs and the lack of checkpoints.
The game looks much better now, it looks washed out and cave like now. It's still so damn gorgeous. And I'm liking the air guitar better with the mask, boy oh boy.
The gameplay is, yeah. I'm liking it a lot. The game is paced just the same as when it launched so maybe that's affecting my opinion a bit.
Overall, it's probably one of my favorite games of the generation and I'm enjoying myself more than I did the past few years. I'm having a blast with

Atheerios: It seems as if the Switch is seeing the largest first week sales in history, and overall Nintendo Switch sales are great.
Every week first party games skyrocket in sales.
The top selling games in the week is on the 1st, with the 2nd week sitting right at the top is soon. It looks like the Switch is in the top 20 of most selling consoles in the world right now.
Doesn't it kind of suck that at the beginning of February, the top selling games in the week were GTAV, FIFA 18 and Red Dead 2.

~!~Why do the Xbox Adaptive Controller colors all look like a palette swap?

Dartastic: So, it's been a while since I've done it myself, but I remembered trying out the TUNER TUNES trial at my friends' place. The colors all look exactly the same, but the blacks and tones come off a bit differently.
I've seen a few people report the same issue with the Adaptive Controller colors on the store for some time, but I didn't notice any further fixes or feedback on Reddit. I'm curious as to the reason except...
Microsoft doesn't want to encourage this sort of behavior from the community.
This seems like an issue to me, and it's really weird. I get that people enjoy seeing what it looks like in person, but if the color tones are the same, then what's the point? I don't want to see the same muted colors that the community has been seeing all this time.
I've always thought of this as a similar thing in the case of the Sakura Wars color swap, where the purple overall looks like a palette swap as opposed to the other colors.
-----
Reckoner: It's not something you should see all the time, OP.
"They all actually look the same" is false advertising and it's the norm.
-----
Dartastic: I get that. I don't really see why people find the Adaptive Controller colors like this. They seem to be mixing the colors with the colors.
-----
Dartastic: I think it's part of the culture. People see the colors they want and are there for it.
-----

~!~Cross Play, Devotion, Anthem vs EA's Battlefront II and Days Gone

Loudninja:

-----
Maxim726x: I was going to post this but I figured it was worth sharing.
-----
Zelas: Anthem is a better game than Days Gone.
I love cross play, it allows devs to have better control over what players are playing and is far more stable than the traditional matchmaking.
-----
GhostTrick: "cross-play" 
(Not saying I agree with this)
-----
IbizaPocholo: Anthem: "Cross-play"
-----
Rumblebones: I don’t know if that is fair, but the “competition” aspect is interesting to me, the game will be released publicly next month, will have everyone worldwide playing, and will have lots of cosmetics and crafting. The trailer also touches upon the similarities between Days Gone and CoD. I also wonder if this is a cross-platform trailer.
The other thing to note is that the Xbox version will not have cross-play with other platforms at launch because of the performance. There is no indication yet what the “Competitive Freez” will be like.

====================
~!~OK, let's say my launch PS4 is busted. Let's replay some games, and post our best memories.

Me: Just starting to get the gears feels.
Ok, so my launch PS4 is busted.......
1. The cable is not tight. I've heard lots of horror stories about this, but I'm not sure if it's the cable or the joycons. The joycons are fine, but the joycons just feel like they're moving too fast.
2. The cable is a little loose, and the joycons are still holding on. I've heard this before, the joycons are fine, but at a full price, and I'm not sure how long, I'll have to buy a new joycon set in an heartbeat. I'm trying to figure out where I can get the performance and IQ from the controller with a standard PS4 controller, but I don't know much about how those matters. Is it just a PS4 portability issue? I'm curious about the controller reliability of the controller, but I'm sure that if I do get a new joycon set, I'll be amazed.
3. The joycons are not reliable at all. There's just no button remapping, which is a must for me. I have a launch PS4, and I have no idea how well the controllers worked or how to change attachments work. There's so many problems... especially with the joy cons and the sticks. The sticks have been laggy to the point where I have to go to the sleep mode to use them. The cable management for the joycons is not great, and I'm not sure how to move them in general. I don't know if there are drill bits or connectors to plug the joycons into.
4. I'll probably end up regretting this, and I'm not sure if I'll be spending next week spending money on this. The reason I'm asking here is, is I'm playing a lot online. It would be nice to finally play some games with my buddies, but I just don't know how to move them around.
I'm not a very patient player, so I sometimes end up doing the manual moves or pressing the "move" button to make my sister move the camera in one moment, while I wait for the next manual action.
I'm not sure if I should hold off, or play this game for a bit.

~!~"The King of Fighters'n" My Hero's quest (PS4) added to PS+

Gradon: Hey all,
This month's monthly update for PS+ adds King of Fighters XIV's Season 1, New My Hero theme, and several other additions. Keep in mind though, this update is just the download version of the theme.
The patch notes state:
I liked the music so much I had to share it with everyone. Can't wait to play this again!
-----
Porygon: At first I thought it was this patch as well.
-----
TheStebe: Oh wow awesome, I forgot about this patch, will add it to my library
-----
Ryutaryi: No PS+? That's kinda weird.
-----
Gradon: I played the first few missions of this, but the world map is just a menu. I checked to see if it was available in the menu and it didn't appear. I tried to play as the world map, but it's just a menu.
-----
Ryutaryi: Yeah, I should've checked and see if it was available in the ps plus section.
-----
Ryugarr: I bought it right before the game came out and I absolutely loved every second of it. I'll download it again for sure.
-----
Papertoonz: still on my work list , so it wont get locked behind the paywall
-----
Spring-Loaded: Whoa 
I was hoping for a PS+ free copy of this to be available for PS3 and Vita as well. 
I guess the PS4 doesn't have this, either ?

~!~Anyone else miss your old '60s console?

BladeoftheImmortal: I miss my old consoles.
You ever see those old discs that look nice today but in the early days they felt like a toy. I'd be totally on board with that but after watching a few of the videos on the net I've kinda lost my sense of console nostalgia.
-----
Derachi: I think it was when I was around 12 or so. I had a SNES and N64 for a good chunk of that time. I think I owned a minimum of a dozen consoles at some point. 
The PS2 and Xbox were the last consoles I ever owned, but I did have a PS1 and a N64. I was also a Nintendo fanboy at that point.
-----
BocoDragon: I miss the PS1/N64 era. I’m one of those people that only has nostalgic memories of the console manufacturers themselves.
-----
BladeoftheImmortal: I still have that trophy medal from the old place
-----
FairyEmpire: My SNES and NES eras were those big bastards. I had a very early PS1, but didn't own one until PS3/360 generation. The PS2 was a game machine that took 300-400 games to beat the Dreamcast, and that was in an all-in-one package. The PSP was simply great, I even played the new games on it when I was younger. The Wii was the first and greatest of handhelds, and it had a lot of great games (including a brilliant port of the original PS2 that was eventually sold for 360s). It was a lot more of a console manufacturer back then, but the fact that they were making a new generation of hardware with the PS2 and Xbox was pretty special.

-----
stealthyfrog: That's pretty awesome. They're doing a lot with content.
-----
KZXcellent: I was hoping they'd push in a special pack that included three Acts or something. I guess they've given the power pack a LOT more time.
-----
Regulus Tera: Bahaha!

~!~How would you feel if Nintendo didn’t release a new Mario Kart for Switch?

delete12345: I am in favor of a new Mario Kart. I would be fine with getting a new entry for the system (I prefer Mario Odyssey as a portable MK game, and would love to see DK Tropical Freeze on the Switch), but Nintendo doesn’t want to cannibalize the approach of previous Nintendo games (so no more MK8 Deluxe).
If there’s any other series you’d like to see released after a Mario Kart 7, I’d include (but don’t necessarily have to wait for a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe), and why it wouldn’t be DK Pass.
-----
Noppie: I don't think it would sell well. Nintendo doesn't have a racing game, if they did it would be a dud.
-----
delete12345: Ah, okay. Thank you.
-----
TriggerShy: I'd be okay with Nintendo releasing MK7 if it was legit, though.
-----
Ababol: I'd be okay with them not releasing a new Mario Kart, as long as the quality is outstanding.
-----
delete12345: True, but I feel like MK7 is still the pinnacle of the series.
-----
Mazzle: They already have the racing formula in place to appeal to a mass market, and doesn't need an entry level roster.
-----
Deleted member 14002: I for one am dissapointed in Nintendo who feels the same way.
Placing MP on the Henshe should not be a challenge.

~!~I don't get any Smash Bros Ultimate gameplay footage

Kylo Rey: I just got the first smash adventure trailer from a friend of mine and it does not provide any gameplay footage whatsoever.
So what am I even playing?
It's a video capture card (there are no USB ports)
The first thing I do is put my phone into the capture card and open the foundry, go to page 11. It is good but it seems that the game is not loading and it says "Not available in store or online".
The second thing is that it says "product cannot be connected to device storage" which I checked before and was not true at all. It said that it's hard to connect to storage.
The third thing is how to deactivate saves.
I checked again and it says that the game is not loading but it connects to storage.
There are hundreds of usernames and passwords.
The most recent thing I found is Shadowplay.
It says that you have to create an account and it's easy to create a character.
The second thing that I deactivated is the app and the game says that you can't save.
It says that you need to set a save file and it's hard to access it.
The third thing is the "stuttering" bug. It says it's because the game is not loading and there is no sound. It says you have to close the game and start it again.
I checked again and the game says that you have to use the game to create an account.
I closed the game and the game said that the character is not available.
It said that you have to play through the game with a controller.
You can go back to the game and go to the profile and the character is not available.
The game says that you can't invite people in the game
The third thing is the "stuttering" bug. It says it's because the game is not loading and there is no sound.
I closed the game and the game says that you have to open the character and it's not available.
The third thing is the "stuttering bug" and then closes the game and kicked the game back to continue.
The game says it's getting harder and harder to invite people.
I closed the game and once more the character is not available.
I was unable to get the game to load.

~!~Will God of War be the 'post-apocalypse?' Game in the Next 10 Years?

Phantom Thief: I am sitting here reflecting over the last 10 years on God of War, the series, its director, Kojima, the series, and the bold marketing message it has been announcing and the ways it has been consumed. I know it has had an outsized popular backlash, but I want to talk about what the reception to the game has been through the years, and what the reception has shaped and changed from one revered series to another.
The game has been hyped for so many things, from being rebooted, to being the big new epic adventure, to an epic story, to another popular movie, an anime, a trailer, a trailer disc, a trailer disc. It has faced so many awards and is so received so much, and it doesn’t even have a single word of praise about itself, or its story, or its direction, or its gameplay, or its direction. 
While this may be true for most people, I think it is important to talk about how the game has been received, and how it has shaped the reception of its series. This is even without the claims of its specific role as a post-apocalypse. It is the game that has become, critically, mainstream, in the ways it has influenced pop culture. These are the games that have gone on to win the Metacritic Backs Up Awards and become games that influenced popular games like Uncharted, Mad Max, God of War, Horizon, GTA, Call of Duty, and GTA:Online. 
Some of these games – Journey, Cuphead, The Last of Us, The Evil Within, Journey, Journey, Crysis, Ghost of Tsushima, Metro, Half Life, God of War, God of War: Ascension, Cyberpunk, The Evil Within 2, Gran Turismo, Fallout, Nier, Red Dead Redemption 2, The Evil Within 2, Biomutant, Monster Hunter, Okami, Persona, Monster World, Red Dead Redemption 2, RAGE, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Sable, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Tekken 7, Soul Calibur, Halo, Luigi's Mansion, Mario Kart, Metroid, Resident Evil, Splatoon, Surgeon Simulator, Resident Evil, Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, The Elder Scrolls, Xenogears, Yakuza, Tony Hawk

~!~Which games will you wait till all-new DLCs are released?

Araujo: We have been hearing about this for a while.
In particular, the hype for God of War just keeps going stronger. And if we are talking DLC, it is usually the Battlefield or Destiny situation where it gets announced, and we can wait till we get our hands on the game.
So, which games are you waiting?
Do you buy all new DLCs?
Or only have access to some new ones?
Also, what franchises and/or modes do you prioritize?
-----
Drewton: God of War, Spiderman, Days Gone, Horizon 4, Splinter Cell
-----
vestan: It's definitely all-in, I still need to finish all the DLC.
But I'll probably wait until the Christmas (when I have more money to burn) and maybe buy it day one.

Kyoufu: A lot of the time it's all in release-gasm.

ZiggyPalffyLA: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a great game, with a few flaws (never played many). But it's definitely the best one out of any Nintendo game. The sense of exploration, exploration, and adventure is paramount. There's a reason the Zelda games are a staple of Nintendo's video franchise.

~!~The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Amazon/Mozilla push to find every old lost game and find everything taken

Tizoc: The strange ghost from "The adventure that started the whole all-new adventure game" thread
It's a recent trend with the recent push of remasters. We've seen a few on the PS3 and 360, and some on the PS4, but lately we've seen most of the big ones go for the scrap, and even the original game of the generation, Shadow of the Colossus, came to an end at the end of its life.
Many people, specially on the old side of the internet, seem to have been waiting for the chance to jump ship a long time ago. After all, the original game was a puzzle game in disguise, but well, that wasn't the final push it seemed.
Now, I'm not specifically talking about the push to find every old lost game, or the recent push to find every old game in existence, but rather about the push to find every old game and get everything in every place.
The Playstation Classic introduced us to a new appreciation and appreciation for old games, and it's this appreciation and appreciation, that we see with the Playstation Classic. The Playstation Classic is the PS1 classic, and it's a machine that sets the standard for all other machines in the market and for its country and console. This means that the Playstation Classic, while it's kind of a weird machine, has a lot of value, and it's a good reason to get one, and so I think it's a good time to get the Playstation Classic.
The Playstation Classic introduced us to a new appreciation and appreciation for old games, and it's a thing that we can see with the Playstation Classic.

The movie was still airing around the time the movie's title was mentioned. The actor who plays Coyle had not performed well in the film and the movie's director had to shutter the movie. 
A sequel to the film was supposed to be released in theaters around the same time as the movie's movie. Moviegoers were letting the film air for about 2-3 hours before it was eventually taken down.

~!~Have you ever bought a game that was very cheap and then spent 10 hours and spent more hours just re-buying it?

KrigareN-: I think this can happen with a lot of people, especially those that have very high spending habits like myself. Last time I bought a game I was very happy, but with very low prices, I ended up not playing it at all.
Now I've bought a lot of games for less than full prices, and I never spent more than a few hours in the game, yet I never spent more than 10 hours in the game.
I think this always happens to me. Is it just me, or does the way Steam works always offer a lot of great games for less money?
-----
Mazzle: Not really.
If you want a game to be worse than the rest of the games available for it, you'll never get it. And there's a reason why publishers don't go that route.
-----
XSX: Definitely.
-----
Flandy: Yes and I say this as often as I go through the store
-----
TheRedSnifit: I've never bought a game I didn't really enjoy.
-----
Cess007: It's not always a problem, but I would have regretted buying something that was incredibly cheap. I've never bought a game that I had a bad opinion about. It's just that there are too many good games being made at the same time.
-----
KrigareN-: I don't think it's always an issue. Sometimes I buy games that I really like and then I forget everything about it and it turns out to be a mess.
-----
Kazoku_: Literally never. Especially when it was like $200.
I could give up on a lot of RPGs and games I really wanted to play for a while, but I just never did.
-----
KrigareN-: I've bought a lot of games for $60 on Steam.
-----
Phantom Thief: This is me too! And I usually wait for price drops, but I never impulse buy a game.

~!~Is the Switch's biggest screens actually bigger than the 3DS?

Neoxon: As of March 6th, the 3DS had the smallest portable home console ever (per the New 3DS Guide). Considering how big the home console has become, I thought it'd be a good idea to look back on where we got the most portable home console-sized home console-specific games from where we got the Switch. And if we do, what games do you think were big games as a result?
With a huge screen, is it really possible to have a big HD-screen portable home console? Or, do we have the complete opposite, where only a small portion (e.g., the handful of games that are actually on 3DS screens) are actually big screens?
-----
FrostyLemon: Nope, not at that size.
-----
Nuclear Muffin: The Switch is the size of a Game Boy!
-----
VillagerMax: I think most people consider the 3DS to be the largest screen to ever exist. The screen on the Switch is tiny, however it does exist as an hybrid, so it's not a portable home console.
-----
LiK: Not the 3DS.
-----
Noppie: I thought this was a thread about the 3DS that was the largest home console ever and the opposite.
-----
Wolfgunblood: The 3DS. It's the largest portable home console ever IMO.
-----
Neoxon: There's more than enough portable across all of Nintendo’s titles to warrant a larger screen, in my opinion.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: Not the 3DS, but 2DS, 1.5gb to 6.1gb.
-----
Kuro: The 3DS. The 2DS is the largest, and the Switch is the largest portable console ever.

I've already started with the PS1 version with the following:
That's about it. The rest is history.
-----
KZXcellent: I'd say the main branch is the big jump in quality from the original (which was a PS3 launch title) to the last half. I think there's a lot of changes that need to be made as well.
-----
Maxey: I believe Final Fantasy 8 was the first game to get official translated translations, on the same time as Final Fantasy XII.
-----
Dreamboum: Yeah but even with that perspective I think the main branch is the biggest jump
-----
Aters: How is this a spoiler?
-----
Dreamboum: You can say that in the thread title 
But yeah, the major branch is a big deal
-----
Gegz: I don't think it's a spoiler, I'm pretty sure it makes sense at least :D
-----
hussien-11: It's a very good game, but the quality of the official translations is questionable, the story is a classic and the characters are... not.
I think folk want more games like this, so they want a better quality product.
-----
Jawmuncher: The PS1 version on PS4 was already a thing. 
The X-2 on PS4 was something else.
Now, they could have proper voice acting for the translation. That’s one of the best things about the game. As well as having a really good story.

~!~Why did Nintendo cut its first party share on the Switch?

Phendrift: Does anyone remember the 2DS or the 3DS?
Nintendo has released a consistently strong first party line up on the Switch thus far. However, it seems like the Switch is different. It seems like Nintendo has more freedom to design its first party and more flexibility in terms of what it gets on the platform.
Do you think this is a smart move? Would Nintendo have made a better game on it if they had released a portable yet again?
-----
Narasumas: I think it’s just a case of budget.
-----
phanphare: they could have released a portable version and I wouldn't mind huge sales but I think it's a pretty simple thing to do
-----
Sub Boss: Because i see 3rd party games, not 1st party games, on the switch
-----
Aters: I don't think that's an option.
-----
Phendrift: I think it’s simple.
They can release an N64 version, but it’s going to be $100+ and portable, and they can also release a new 2nd switch entry which is going to be more of the same.
-----
Zalman: They know people want Switch to bomb.
-----
TheMoon: it's a simple thing to do.
they know people want indies, so they want to make money with nintendo platforms.
-----
Cartridge Games: I imagine it’s the same, as they keep selling 3DS and soon switch games.
They don’t have to worry about it too much.
The switch doesn’t need to be a 3rd party. They can sell whatever they want (except a new game)
-----
Mazzle: They don't need to worry about it too much. They've been able to keep selling 3DS, Mobile, and Switch.
They know people want indies as well as Switch.

vestan: I'm not too familiar with this but this showed up recently on the Steam page and is apparently very good. It's a short game with a good combat system and a decent artstyle.
-----
BDS: I don't get the hate, but I can't stand how bad this game looks.
-----
Lux86: I like this game. Definitely not my kind of game
-----
vestan: Btw, I think it's a good game, but I don't like the way it looks.

Sotha_Sil: I remember seeing this game and being intrigued by it on the PS Store. Now I'm not sure if I'm interested in it...
-----
Saint-14: This looks cool and I’m not sure what’s bad about it?

vestan: I think a lot of people didn't like it either because it looked like a cheap mobile port. The PS4 Pro version looked better though.

Sotha_Sil: It's $30 on the PS Store.

~!~Do you think Sony's new PSVR program could tank in value?

Wololo: I would like Sony to get out of the hardware business entirely, if it means cutting some of the crappy, niche, and maybe not so expensive accessories they charge for.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it would only work with accessories. Not sure if there's much value in it.
They’ve already said they’re not touching VR too soon
-----
dmix90: I think it would be a bad idea. Accessories will remain expensive as is.
-----
Trago: No. I think it's a nope for most people. 
VR is already too expensive to justify.
-----
shaneo632: No.
-----
Memento: It will sell fine. But top line PSVRs won't sell as well as they should.
-----
The Last Wizard: It’s going to be a no brainer. If you want to support the platform I feel. It’s a huge market and I think Sony knows it.
-----
Betty: They'd have to cut some of the accessories to at least cover that portion.
-----
Kawngi: I quite liked the idea, but it would need some more premium content and DLC to really make it worthwhile. I think it's the right move, but it was a bit of a nightmare on their first attempt and I don't know if they could have fixed it with a fresher showing of the product.
I wouldn't be surprised if they just scrap the idea and instead add PSVR support for PS5. 
If they are serious about getting out of the hardware business I'd be happy for them to just scrap the idea and add some PSVR support for PS5. That's a small consolation, but it should at least give them the chance to make a more mainstream product.
-----
cakely: I think the most likely scenario is that they at least make a small VR-only budget, premium VR headset, and a base PSVR device.

~!~LTTP: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Wow

Phantom Thief: Yeah, this is not a LTTP thread, even for Breath of the Wild.
This is not a LTTP at all.
So, I just finished Breath of the Wild.
I have some thoughts on the game that concern me.
Breath of the Wild is great. It’s one of the greatest games ever made, and one of the best games ever. The sense of adventure and peril is unparalleled. The world is so beautifully realized. I have not been this sad and anxious since I completed the first world in OOT. I feel like I am doing the same thing again, in my own world.
The level of art direction is just sublime. The music is genius. The sense of scale and wonder is in wide use. The enemies are appropriately larger in number than they were in the first game.
The story is as good as it gets. The gist of everything is there, and the characters are as charming and in excellent hands.
I’m not even going to go into the secret methods and back-stabbing that are in this game.
The combat is good. It’s simple, but not really overly so, and the enemy variety is great. The enemies have a great variety of abilities, and I really find myself enjoying the darker tone and generally darker atmosphere of the first game.
The two main exceptions are SoT and ALTTP. SoT’s enemies are pretty underwhelming, but the scale and magical nature of the world and its inhabitants makes them engaging and fun to fight. ALTTP has its issues, but the writing and voice acting are on point.
I love the art style so far. It has a very good mood to it, and the jumping puzzles are all fun and engaging. I do wish that the cutscene skipping bug was fixed. I’m not quite sure if that would’ve been a problem if it didn’t. I guess that would explain why the game is so memorable.
The only major complaint I have is that the difficulty is so uneven. The game only gets worse from here, and although I’m nowhere near a Wii-level of difficulty (it’s pretty much level 8 or so), I can’t help but be pulled in by the oppressive and depressing atmosphere.
I will

~!~Monster Hunter World has sold over 6 Million Copies [PC]

Rodjer: This is insane, and we can even say that the game has sold more on the Switch than on the PS4, with an average PC game of like 20-30 Million. 
Monster Hunter World is a great game, with many features that the Switch could use.
-----
Kalentan: Impressive, I'd guess.
-----
texhnolyze: Wow, that's impressive.

Kyoufu: Monster Hunter World is killing it now, I guess.

~!~Poll: Which has the best soundtrack?

J 0 E: I havent played KH3. But I was thinking about it a bit and I´m sure I heard that soundtrack way more than KH1
-----
Salty_Josh: I think it better Kingdom Hearts and Birth By Sleep.
-----
darkside: I think Terra for Nomura was made for the FF7 Remake
-----
NightShift: Terra was made for the FF7 Remake for the Switch.
-----
Bishop89: KH2 is still the best in the series and VII was made for FF7 Remake
-----
FiXalaS: Kingdom Hearts 2
-----
Roxas: KH2 is my personal favorite, but Birth By Sleep is a close second.
-----
Roxas: Nier is the best spin-off in the franchise, but KH2 is definitely the best game.
-----
Chaserjoey: I’m going to go with Kingdom Hearts.
I played the first three games in the series and was so excited for a remake of VII and it’s biggest flaw was the lack of a true 3rd Strike game. I loved how the series had chemistry with its cast, Ayane and Yumen, and whatnot. BBS was another interesting turn-off, but was just really dull and repetitive for me.
-----

====================
~!~I wish there was an easier way to get into the series, has anyone tried it?

Deleted member 1258: I've played through the first game, which is the first game in the series, and I've done a lot of things in it, except I really don't want to bother with the rest of the game. I know I'm probably going to have to skip this one.
I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do with the tools I have for playing through the games?
-----
vestan: Probably the Nier Automata demo.
I'm looking to try and break into the Platinum tier and jump into the Nier trilogy.
-----
Aters: I did a lot of digging and found a lot of info that I do miss. I'm assuming that you can use guides or some sort of process to find stuff? I had tons of fun with the Platinum Demo, but I played the first three and dropped it.
-----
Deleted member 1258: Just follow the guide, it’s very easy. You will probably be great. I’ve read that it’s a lot more of an interactive movie than a gameplay demo
-----
Real Renaissance Man: I did a lot of reading, tried several different guides to make sure it was all explained along the way and most importantly you'll be able to see if you've already done the game before by looking at your loadouts and difficulty before you begin the game. It's really good and a real shame that it's coming out on PS4.

~!~What is your ideal way of sending messages on Switch?

Lant_War: The Switch has a lot of social features, and it's still one of the most popular platforms for Nintendo fans. I just realized the other day that I only send messages on the account I use for Smash.
I'm also not super interested on sending friend requests or anything like that. But I can send them to people on other platforms if I feel like it. I've been doing this for years now.
My ideal way is to use a private messaging account for everything, so I can see the conversations I've been Text'd with, send them, then ask them for a reply and continue sending.
I would be nice if you guys and gals could weigh in and give you a simple yet really effective approach.

~!~Why are the Resident Evil games so popular in Japan?

Crazy Izanagi: So I’m sure most of you are thinking “the west is scared of RE,” but that’s only partially true.
The Resident Evil series has been in a weird situation for quite some time now that began to explain Japan’s specific weaknesses.
The first was the lack of momentum and a lack of innovation in many titles.
The second was the over saturation of modern games which hit a sweet spot and got a lot of people hooked to them.
The third was the lack of horror movies which always felt a little out of place or a big jump out of the park.
The fourth was the fact that the game is actually a survival horror game and had to force you into playing the actual Survival Horror part to survive.
The last was the lack of memorable third person shooters.
And last I heard, the series has been dormant for almost a decade and the last time it really did well was when 4 and 5 came out on 3DS.
So which is the reason why the series has been so successful in the western market? Is it because the series is really popular in the west?
-----
Fat4all: i thought the only reason they are still getting new IPs is because of the popularity of Resident Evil
EDIT: nevermind, forgot about the latest of the series
-----
vestan: I think it's because the series actually ends up being really popular in the west. Recently I came to like the first three Resident Evil games more as a Westerner myself and I played them all in under half an hour on handheld.
-----
Van Bur3n: Because the west is more open about their IP’s and can actually bring it to a more normal platform.
-----
Aurc: They've been doing the opposite all their lives. They're the only ones that really care about their IPs critically, and this is why. They care about your games.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: The western audience doesn't care about RE, they're cool with RE7, and we know what Capcom is working on with RE.
They are never going to get the success they deserve.
-----
Rineol: They're the only ones that really care about a particular genre/issue(s) and have actually put something else on the table that they

~!~What is your favorite side quest in gaming?

dharmapolice: I’m curious about what goes into making you love the game. 
I started playing Witcher 3 about two weeks ago and the main quest was a very good and memorable side quest. 
But I had already finished the main quest in Witcher 2 and got the 4th one before the big update (which added side content and a bunch of things). 
Do you like side quests? Are there any particular ones you all think about during the play through?
-----
ASleepingMonkey: I played through the Trails in the Sky duu9 last year and absolutely loved every second of it. I didn’t even have a ton left in me to go after.
I really liked the two in Fables in Sky. They’re all good, but I put in a lot of hours before I really understood what the story was trying to accomplish and I really liked the quests.
-----
CenturionNami: Dragon's Crown. 
I played the first TWD for the first time and absolutely loved every second. 
Then I had a really bad feeling realization that I was playing the weakest sidequest in the game. I was like, "this is.... not what I was expecting. I should just...stop and think about it."
Then it happened.
"Oh, it's a piece of crap made by a really really really really really really really good person."
"Yeah, but I can't imagine liking it at all."
"It's the worst."

~!~The six year run on Starbreeze's (eurocom, as we should know by now) "indie studio" has been a thing for a long time

Phantom Thief: In today's issue of the journal hetector. Starbreeze (or at least, I think it's been posted in the Starbreeze thread) considers their Independent Games Studio label a bit like a label for a fossil fuel:
-----
LewieP: Yes, I believe this is published.
-----
Dreamboum: Their former boss left the company and there were some troubles with the management. They're in a difficult position right now honestly. They're making a lot of money with their own limited studios and they're trying to make quality games. They're not in a position to be greedy or bad at anything else.
-----
Daffy Duck: That's pretty harsh if you consider the studio like PlatinumGames as an independant studio making games
-----
Phantom Thief: They are independent, yes. They made the studio to be very greedy and terrible.

~!~How often do you buy games on Switch?

Odeko: This weekend I just went for the big prize in Smash Bros Ultimate.
I had a great time all day, playing with friends was a blast but my particular position was with a friend who was playing Fortnite.
My party is above 50 so I had to wait a few hours.
My wife is playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and I’m enjoying it.
Now I’m carrying my Switch in my room and I just got my eshop card and checked my account and I could access the funds.
I guess I’ve settled on two to three games a month.
-----
Porygon: I'll usually only buy one a month, but in the past year I've been doing it more often
-----
Grapezard: Only buy one a month, unless it's a game I'm really interested in, or a family game like House, for example.
-----
Renna Hazel: If it's a game I really like, and it's the first time I'm really invested in it, I'll usually buy one a month.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I buy 3 a month. 
Generally I buy one every week at least.
-----
ghostcrew: Only one a month. I don’t really do it on a weekly basis. Just once I know I'll like it on launch day.
-----
Pancakes R Us: Only one a month. Actually only one, because I need to make sure I’m buying the right version.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Nah, I only buy one a month.
-----
Decarb: Only one a month. I usually buy one every month, though there is normally a fourth game a month between).
-----
Jaded Alyx: I mean, I don't have a second hand store and haven't had to actually try and buy stuff, but I do make exceptions for big digital games like The Witcher 3 since I generally just go for what the community puts on the cart and DLC, if I like it enough to justify it. This has been a process issue for me since launch, though.

====================
~!~Capcom should take another look at Ace Attorney.

Maligna: Seriously. How does this franchise compare to the originals?
I'm talking about an Ace Attorney game set in the Ace Attorney universe. It looks and plays fantastically.
The game is gorgeous. The artstyle is an evolution of the original anime, with a colorful cast, colorful environments, and a story that ignores fantastical elements (I love that aspect of Ace Attorney). The game has a pretty high resolution photo mode. The game even has a pretty neat easter egg system that lets you find the next killer justice per season (though I feel like this would be a pain to implement).
I haven't played the original but I know this is a remake of Ace Attorney. How would that compare to that? Is it more impressive? Is it a modern game? Does it offer any retrograde justice?
-----
Jucksalbe: It's a modern game. You can play it on modern hardware.
-----
Maligna: How do you mean? Are you implying that they did a modern version of the original game?
-----
Hentz: I think it looks better, but theres lots of things about this game it's hard to judge personally.
-----
Maligna: This sounds more like a modern AA spinoff.
-----
Phantom Thief: They tried. It was a remake to appeal to the people that came before them.
-----
Scotia: It’s a modern game. It looks as good as the original game did.
-----
Maligna: Ah, wasn't aware of that. I'll check it out at a minimum.
-----
Phantom Thief: I mean, the original game has a beautiful art style, but the modern day setting and overworld doesn't work to the same degree as the original. 
But it's a remake, so it's not a remake that does what they should try to do.
-----
Jucksalbe: It looks good, but the camera in the original isn't as good, and the overworld is a bit of a mess.

~!~Capture cards are starting to hit the market

60fps: I’ve been trying capturing all manner of game systems in my collection for the past year or so and I’ve noticed that there’s a new set of devices to buy and use that seem to have a small but dedicated dabble in mini devices.
My capture card is tiny (6mm!) and the easiest to get started with because it’s a USB adapter. I’ve been looking at cheaper options like an external capture card that accepts a USB device as input and has an internal battery and it’s pretty cheap so I’m tempted.
I’ve been pretty happy with this, I’ve had my ElGatoCapture adapter for about a year and it charges without being charged once. It’s pretty good I guess.
I’m pretty happy right now when I pull off my capture video and what’s playing on it is, a picture. I’m using the Capture Wizard up in Reddit and the product’s pretty much universal across all devices.
What’s interesting is that this allows me to download the capture software from Nintendo’s site (there’s a preview warrantee going right now on everything) and even up and coming capture software from Nvidia. The capture software seems to have a price tag and is priced reasonably. This is good for anyone looking for something more budget friendly, but I’m hoping for people who aren’t planning on doing every capture and want something that's a little more cost effective than what capture cards cost to do.
I’m not planning on doing any game capture because at some point I’m going to need a capture card for my Switch and a Switch U that supports local capture.
Now, this is probably not “killer” by any means but I really hope Nintendo Manufacturers start making new capture cards.
More devices that support local multiplayer (e.g. Nintendo Switch capture card)
I’m not going to use my capture card for Wii U, Wii Uu, Wii UuU and Switch.
What do you guys think? Do you have any capture cards available to you right now or are there any devices you guys use?

~!~The Worst Thing About An Overpriced Item

Phediuk: I'm making this thread because I'm about to dive back into Pokémon 2019, and I feel like I have to recommend this video that just made me incredibly wary of what's coming out of my Nintendo Switch:
It's so poorly choreographed, so poorly thought through, and so poorly priced it's almost laughable. I'll be buying it tonight.

Grapezard: I'd be more worried about how well the system itself runs on battery life and the hardware itself.

I have a 400 MB HDD with 2 games installed and I have 25 MB free. The OS doesn’t work for any game on that list. I think it’s an issue with the slim? It’s not a problem for anything else.
-----
Flandy: I think it's just for Sony and how much space it takes up
-----
NegroNinja: I have 2 monitors. 1440 and 1080p. I don’t have a 4k monitor to use them with my PS4.
-----
Kuro: just a few incidents I've noticed.
2 games booted on base PS4 from XB1 and had no problem.
-----
LonestarZues: It's a bit more common for the OS to just die or be removed rather than simply get stuck.
-----
Crayon: I've been playing my Switch a lot lately. I've been having a lot of fun doing that. It's not a system level issue, but something that affects a lot of games and OSes.

Vipu: I can't even play a bit with the ps4 in the room.

AquaWater: I am totally interested in seeing more of their games, but yeah I don't really care for them. They don't appeal to me at all.

~!~Overwatch - Picking Tracer - Picking Chrom

Neoxon: With the D.Va. Expansion coming out next Friday, we’ll be bringing you with some new information on the Picking Tracer. Given the D.Va. character was one of the more controversial picks in the Overwatch community on the competitive circuit, it’s good to have another chance to see Tracer.
This will be the first time we see Chrom. The reveal for Chrom was almost right around the same time as the D.Va. character, so I’m hoping we can get some more details on the relationship between the two soon.
-----
Platy: You know what, because it's not about to be "duh"
-----
Dest: You know what, I'm more interested in the reveal that's already out.
-----
Killgore: I'm just happy to see a new Tracer for sure. Played the beta for a while and it was amazing.
-----
Chronospherics: I'm not sure if they will use Genji or not. I would be pretty happy to have another character with more utility.
-----
Borman: If they do not (for example, having Genji in a hero pack), then I'm ok with them using the default.
-----
Neoxon: Well, I mean, Genji isn’t even in OW right now, so I’m not sure what to expect out of it.
-----
Jahranimo: Wow, thats a little disappointing.
-----
Masterspeed: I'm excited but not that interested. I really liked the Chrom. But I'm just happy to see more characters.
-----
KillGore: You can hear me if I get Genji in OW lol

~!~What's happening with Atlus?

Crazy Izanagi: On the one hand we're getting more and more news about the upcoming Lost Arc and on the other it's getting more and more questions and answers about it.
As of late we’ve been hearing constant news of a new Lost game.
Do you think these games will come out in the next three to six months?
Did it already happen?
Are they still going to update the game?
Are they going to make a new handheld game?
What is everyone expecting?
-----
KoolAid: They haven't even announced what the other titles are.
-----

Tribal_Cult: I'm worried
-----
KoolAid: I meant in the middle of the topic. :/
-----
Lotus: They haven't announced anything.
-----
Lotus: They haven't even announced anything.
-----
Abriael: To be fair, they haven't even announced anything.
-----
Phantom Thief: I mean, they said we'd hear more about Lost Arc next week, so it makes sense.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I’m worried.
Those games have the potential of being a lot different from the original game.

~!~Why is there no option to buy PS4 games on PC or Xbox?

entremet: Well it seems the Xbox/PS store is as bad as it was for the last few years. There are no reviews, no insider marketing deals, no acknowledgement of what happened, no pushback, no moderation, no games being sold outside of Asia. I'm starting to lose interest in PC games.
I don't understand why I can play Gears of War 4 on PC, and it's a night and day difference. I played the first chapter and it was the same between PC and Xbox. I'm not interested in Uncharted 4.
I don't like Black Ops 4. I hate the game. It's just awful.
Because I have a PC, I have a PS4 and a PC.
-----
DarthWalden: I think the move from PS store to PC one week before release sort of did this very nicely.
I have never been a huge fan of the PS store but it was a change I was pleasantly surprised by.
I have a PC and a Switch and am going to buy Spider-Man and Forza Horizon 1 next week.
-----
Lopez: PC gamers are scared and have gone PC for the most part
-----
Noisepurge: maybe they are seeing “how many will buy it” and want to support it.
-----
HStallion: I know I am. I rarely buy new PC games and I much prefer to be able to play them on the go with my wife.
-----
Proteus: I thought the Xbox Store was better and reliable compared to the PC store.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: Sony wants you to buy their games. They won’t.
-----
Flux: I don't think the PS Store is as good as the PC one for me. The Xbox one has a much more loyal audience.
-----
Hardvlade: I love the PS store but the exclusives section is incredibly shoddy. I would just turn off reviews and everything else, and if it wasn't for the rumors, I would have totally turned off my Xbox.
-----
Necron: I would not be excited by Halo Wars 2 and Wolfenstein 2.

====================
~!~I need to introduce a child to gaming and console gaming.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I live in a town far away from the city where I grew up and where I never had a console. I grew up with NES and SNES and I was never really good at gaming. I remember my highschool class playing the NES on a CRT TV and moving to a small CRT. I'd play for a bit but it only took until my Junior's course in computing and laser computer to really get interested in gaming. I'd play anything but. I was a computer guy at the time so I had to be selective. I was also selective of what I did and didn't do in my free time. I'd do all the free computer or whatever stuff and it was a lot more manageable.
I did have some free time as well. I got into Fortnite a long time ago. My brother and I would play. We had a pretty good time with God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2. But the real hardest thing for me was figuring out how to play games properly. I could never remember how to win in a strategy game like that. So I can't play well paced shooters or strategy games. I just need to get my ass handed to me and learn how to hit people.
I was in middle school. My dad was a bigger Playstation fan than I was, but he bought me my first gaming TV in 2007. It was the Playstation 2. I got a PS2 at a thrift store and played it for a few years. We got to be good at videogames when I got older. Then a year or two ago I got a Switch and started playing video games. I don't really have a way of playing games or using my hands or anything. I only play shooters or strategy games. I just want to be better. It took me a while to relearn all the basics again. I can't really play the same games as other kids. It's really hard. But I still try.
But I'm not there yet. Last year I finished a mission in Destiny. This year I'm going to finish up a mission in WoW. I'm gonna do this at my own pace. I don't want to get to waste hours getting better at a game. I don't want to spend my life like that. I want to do this.
So
====================
~!~Anyone here ever use a wireless keyboard and mouse?

Krejlooc: I am.
I don't want to be the worst person you randomly hit with a game, because I want to be able to keyboard/mouse and keyboard/mouse and keyboard and mouse.
Ever.
I was playing God of War when the game made an auto alt right quest.
And it was glorious.
A young lad walked in and said "how many times did you cross this mountain?"
And I said "no."
And he said...
And I said "fuck you stupid child"
And he said "nah"
But I left the game.
I'm not sure what you were looking for, but it was in a movie with the American flag over the background.
I only saw it in the trailer for Horizon ZD, and I'm wondering if I'm supposed to have seen it coming.
I'm sure it's been there since I have played it, but I didn't want to spoil it.
But who was looking for it?
Me?

samred: Get a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and even mouse and keyboard. I've had a Logitech G305 wireless for a good while, and I love it.
-----
Syriel: I use a wireless Logitech G203. I just got a new one that came with the Spiderman game.
-----
Krejlooc: I've just had a fat mouse for about two weeks, and I'm using my Logitech G900.
It's what I've used for about two years now, but I've never actually used it. What I've been seeing with most Logitech mice is that they are essentially the same. I don't feel like using them, but I look forward to when it's something I should invest in. 
The Logitech G900 is my #1 m
-----
Flandy: Yeah jump on that shit now
-----
Krejlooc: If you've been seeing those mice on the store shelves you'll have a butt load of money out of it.

Krejlooc: I thought about it, and...

Aniki: I use my Logitech G900 with a Bluetooth mouse. Its perfect.

~!~Nintendo Switch Online - New Games Available on 9/18

Regiruler: Some games (mainly Kirby) are out on 9/18, and they're not available for download, but they're also 50% off and you can play with others.
I'm not sure if all the games are available, but some are pretty cheap.
These games are:
NSMBU Deluxe
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Super Bomberman R
NES
Mario Tennis Aces
Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze
Mario Tennis Aces
Pokemon
These are all good value, but it looks like they are pushing online only.
These are NSMBU Deluxe, Super Bomberman R, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
-----
The Last Wizard: So no Tropical Freeze is a deal, with online?
-----
Regiruler: Yep.
-----
Regiruler: Is there a list of all the games on Switch online?
-----
Kanjiology: Is there any price drop for Bomberman?
-----
Kanjiology: Anyone?
-----
Regiruler: No idea, thought it was 50% off.
-----
Fireblend: Super Bomberman R for sure

The Last Wizard: I’m guessing you have the Deluxe bundle for 50% off, the base package will be around 80% off.

~!~BOTW is the first true Zelda and it just works.

Dizagaox: The most important thing to me and my friends is that BOTW is the first true Zelda and it just works.
You’ll notice on the title screen of the game, the same thing happens everytime. I don’t think it’s something to be proud of, it just works. Zelda is just so good.
I’m just as much a Zelda fan as I am a hardcore Zelda fan.
-----
Kamiyouni: The first true Zelda.
-----
TheSubsequentStrajack: It's not just a Zelda game. It's a Zelda game in a totally different category.
-----
vestan: It doesn't just work.
-----
Shugga: I think the reason why games have been popular for decades is because they force the player to adopt a different gameplay style for different reasons than you'd expect. Smash Bros is a good example of this.
-----
Mazzle: You don't need to learn a new game
-----
DarthWalden: I think that's the most important part for me. 
I played the first few hours of the game and I gotta say I was not enjoying it at all. 
I mean the game is a 3D Zelda game, so I guess? It just doesn't have the flair to it, I'm not sure why they took that away for BotW.
-----
Kadin: I don't know what it is about BotW but I think it's a great game.
-----
Dysun: I think it works because of the constant dialogue and “back tracking” throughout the game. It’s the sequel to BOTW but you do backtrack a bit andExplore some more. It’s a fantastic game.
-----
Okabe: I never got that until last month

~!~What do you think of the 'Fantastic Four' and 'The Silver Case' franchise?

Crazy Izanagi: So the 'Fantastic Four' and 'The Silver Case' series are both acclaimed gaming franchises of the same era. So if you ask me a question that the older games have had a chance at becoming a more popular is if they are the best. I’d like to limit my answer to the first three games.

The Fantastic Four:
�The Fantastic Four�- 
�Eric the Wise�
�Joseph the Cowardly Warrior�
�Yuri Kurubia������������������
The Silver Case:
�The Silver Case�- 
�The Silver Case: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles�������������������������������������������������������
The Fantastic Four is the first case of each of the games and is generally regarded as the most iconic case in gaming history. It is often the most well known because of the setting, the setting's themes, and the simple interactions between the cast.
Joseph the Cowardly Warrior is a case that has often been associated with Final Fantasy, including by its name and by its gameplay. It is a series that came to be referred to as Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, or FFCC. Crystal Chronicles is a word that means cow, or in Japanese, "baby," and was initially conceived by three children. These children were named Joseph, "Wish," and "The Wizard," and were later shaped by their mother into cow and wizard. The four main games in the series are Crystal Chronicles, FFCC, Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Blue Method, and Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Green Method.

====================
~!~I wish I could say that Shin Megami Tensei games aren't really well made games, and I love them but that's just not the case

Dreamboum: I don't know when it happened but I think the first game that came to mind was the final fantasy series. It started on the PS2 but there were still a few games developed for the PSP and it didn't really sell very well. The first game that came to mind was Shin Megami Tensei 5 but that was it.
Now that there's been a proper revival of the franchise I think it's time we get to see it again. I think the first game that really brought it to the attention of the west was the Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation, a Shin Megami Tensei game made by the fans of the legendary Kirito. It was a spin-off and it sold very well. The first game after that was Persona 3 Portable. The second was Persona 4. The third was Persona 5.
It's time to celebrate a franchise that was quite dormant, but still has a very active fanbase, a successful business model and is still keeping in the West. I'm talking about the Shin Megami Tensei V.
- The business
Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation was a spin-off game made by the fans of the legendary Kirito. It sold pretty well on the PSP and Vita, but there was still a few games developed for PSP and Vita that didn't sell well.
- The business
Atlus USA and Atlus Japan are very successful in the business side of SMT, they're very profitable nowadays. They're publishing the games in Japan and the West, but they're not really cultivating a strong following in Japan. They're publishing SMTV now, but they're only publishing in the West and only in Japan.
- The business
Masahi and Hashimoto are both long time industry figures, they've also done SM games in their lives. They've also published in Japan and the West. SMTV is still going strong. They recently published Persona 5. 
- The business
Capcom USA is also very successful in the business side of SMT

~!~What if the PS5 supports voice chat?

SageShinigami: I've been wondering this since the announcement of the PS4. What if PS5 supports voice chat? What if the PS5 supports this as well?
I understand that voice chat on consoles is pretty niche, but I'd still be curious to know how much of a population Sony takes voice chat as seriously as PS4.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It's a niche game and if voice chat isn't on the platform you're playing on then it's not going to work very well for voice chat on consoles IMO
-----
Knight613: It doesn't work well on PCs.
-----
Toumari: I'm not sure Sony even allows it.

Phantom Thief: Yeah, Xbox also supported it for a while, Microsoft was the same.

Replicant: Pretty sure it won’t work properly with consoles.

Spyder_Monkey: I mean?
-----
inner-G: I believe it supports chat on consoles but I’m still not sure how big of a community it can get on pc outside of some mute friends like me and some others using it on ps4.

Phantom Thief: Oh, I don't get it.

Liam1884: I think you mean Sony? Speak on console is a perspective that I'm not sure I agree with.

~!~what is the best third person mod you played in 2018 and have not re-installed it?

Canas Renvall: I've been re-installing Yakuza 6 recently and I'm having a blast with it, however I haven't played it in a while due to Kiwami 2 and God Eater. 
I did play Zero and Kiwami 1 and Kiwami 2 in the same year, and had a blast, however I really like 2 and Kiwami 2 to similar degree. 
I'm thinking of re-installing it for Kiwami 2 after loving it so much. 
What was the best and why?
-----
Ryengeku: Yakuza 6 is a remake of the original PS2 era Yakuza and is absolutely gorgeous on PS4.
-----
Canas Renvall: I have to say, Yakuza 6 is by far and the best. Just because it's a remake doesn't mean it's the best. I'd rank it above Kiwami 2 but behind a few other good remakes.
-----
Jawmuncher: I’d argue the original remake of Yakuza 6 above 6. It’s got the best combat system imo.
-----
Jonno394: Additions and I can't think of more recent games I have replayed.
-----
Jawmuncher: Yakuza 6 is the only one I’ve played that I can think of off the top of my head. I think it’s worth replaying if you enjoy that.
-----
Canas Renvall: Thanks! That's actually a great recommendation!
-----
aisback: I played Yakuza 6 in January and I think it's a great game and I got it for £8
-----
aisback: I was really surprised to find the combat system to be really bad. The only good thing about it was the optional minigame.
-----
aisback: I think it’s better than Kiwami 2 which I played a bit. I think the stinger is better than Y6’s but I’d recommend the original one

~!~Biomutant sounds like the best N-sidescrollers of all time

SolVanderlyn: This game is really good.
The world, the characters, the music, the story, the puzzle solving, and the gameplay.
I'm not the biggest fan of the game itself, but I love it.
It's like a Pokemon knock-off. Like, it's super smart, but it's not the greatest platformer game of all time.
The story, while a bit simplistic, is great. The good guys are dead, and the bad guys get to be the bad guys. This game has the best puzzle solving, and the best music.
The game is absolutely brilliant. The only thing it has going for it is the punchy overworld, but it works so well with the brain.
The level design is such a piece of work. The first time you get to a new city, it's just a straight road to the main story. You go to the main lobby, it's short, and the music is amazing.
It's a fantastic game.
-----
DarknessTear: The only truly memorable N-Seed game was the original, which was basically just a collection of mainline N-Sidescrollers. I don't think I've ever beat it, though.

~!~Smash Bros Ultimate - E3 2018 trailer



ScreamingMadden: My only concern with this game is that it seems like thematically it's Smash Brothers, but I'm not 100% sure. It seems like that’s not the case.
-----

ScreamingMadden: I think you're right. I haven't tried it yet, but the first two trailers had some very interesting lore, and I liked what I saw. I just think it'd be a little weird to make Smash Bros a linear game. I know it won’t be, but we’re just saving it for later.
-----
Blackleg-sanji1: You’ve been warned.
-----
Renna Hazel: It makes sense. It was only a year ago that they were planning to overhaul Smash way to well.
-----
udivision: It's a direct from the game and they just didn't do a lot of work on it.
-----
DecoReturns: Because it’s not the best Smash announcement ever.
-----
ScreamingMadden: I just wanted to point out that it’s not the best one. They’re just trying to make straight to the point. They’re not even going to fix a major complaint from fans that were disappointed in how one of the characters was never playable. 
The one thing I do not get though is how the “different” part translates to "me being disappointed". It is a big, big deal and I do not personally think it is complete garbage.
-----

====================
~!~LTTP: Red Dead Redemption 2 - if you haven’t played it yet, now that’s a damn survival game.

TheGamingNewsGuy: I’ve had this game sitting in my backlog ever since I purchased it in the last Direct. I’ve gone back to it thinking it’s a masterpiece and I’m currently working on it as I was planning to before the Direct.
Now I just finished the last bits of the game and have a few thoughts on it.
I remember that the game didn’t quite tell you that much apart from the beginning of the game. The clothes you pick up are all supplies you need to make progress. I thought this was a big part of the game which made me appreciate the importance of camp management.
I went to the beginning area and had to start harvesting animals. I could have done nothing else if the planet didn’t revolve around me and my animals. The game had great atmosphere to me. I landed in a home and the only way to get out was to kill all the animals.
The game had a lot of game systems which all play very similar to survival games. You can work on your loadouts and work out your equipment sets to craft whatever you need. I thought this was a great mix of RPG and Survival game so when the credits started rolling I was on my knees with the animals.
Even animals! I loved the variety of what animals could do. It’s a survival game so you have to focus on the basics and not worry about getting your hands dirty. The game also does a lot with its crafting and crafting up to 3 animals in a single inventory would have required me to do over 100 inventory runs.
Since you have to hunt and you can craft anything you need you can focus on the basics. It’s a survival game but with a lot of mechanics which you can use to craft anything you want.
It felt satisfying to kill all the animals and get my hands dirty.
The game really encourages you to not be greedy and over ambitious. You have to not be greedy with resources and to me this was quite a challenge.
It was also refreshing to know that you could still be excited about your new surroundings. The game does a great job of giving you a nice start to the game by

Cess007: It's still relevant, it just needs better performance on PC, it's a shame.
-----
DarthWalden: Is it on Battle.net?
-----
JaseC: I think it's just a little buggy on PC. There's no offline racers, and the arcade mode in particular doesn't look as good as it should.
-----
DarthWalden: Thanks. Was wondering why the heck is there no OT for it. I'm not sure if I want to play it or not.
-----
Aiustis: The game is still shit.
I had my fun with it I think, but I feel like it's going to be the Dark Souls of the Dead Souls Ranks.
-----
JaseC: I think it's still relevant, little buggy on PC and the arcade mode in which you can play as the Fox in Star Fox, but there's no offline mode, and the game is still a bit shit.
-----
DarthWalden: I guess I'm not sure. I tried to play it a few years ago maybe a couple of hours in, but it was a bit and was not "fun".
I guess I have to admit I'm not sure if I want to play it again.
-----
JaseC: It's still shit. It's not a Battleblock Theatre type game. It's levels, bosses, enemies, and all that jazz. It's worse than a Dark Souls game again, either by far.
-----
Bartend3r: This is getting old !!!

~!~ESRB rates Nintendo's "2P" games for Switch

Atheerios: This is the first time in over a decade that a Nintendo IP has been rated in "ESRB". The rating was made possible to help push for the release of a "high quality" indie game due to the release of "Super Mario Odyssey" in April 2018.
The rating was also used to introduce the new "Super Mario Maker", which now features 16 players.
The NES Online app was also included in the rating.
For other IPs rated in that rating only, see here.
-----
mazi: so they've basically said they want to make other kinds of games?
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it’s pretty clear they want to stay true to whatever they’re doing and not try something new anymore
-----
KoolAid: This could be the best game of 2018 if they made a lot of the games they have are rated for, so yes, it's a great game.
-----
Soapbox Killer Returns: They've seen the success of this genre and have said they are working on something. They're not changing their ways.
-----
808s & Villainy: This goes beyond just being on the Switch
-----
Lelouch0612: Well they have to make more money now after the success of the NES games.
-----
Lelouch0612: It's a profitable industry on the Switch.
-----
Rosebud: This is pretty huge.
-----
Kapryov: This is not a one-off.
I think they have something to do with the success of the NES games.

~!~Why do gamers keep asking for remasters?

Phediuk: The current remasters don't exist.
Some have only recently started taking advantage of it. The first were Uncharted 4 and Final Fantasy XV.
-----
Vicious17: Because most of us long for the days of the past, the days of floppy disks and the internet.
-----
z0m3le: Because it's the internet, and if you want to find old videos, lists are always small and hard to find, so most of the time they are lost in the hyper focus of the internet.
-----
Silky: Because you'll never find old videos again
-----
Kenzodielocke: Because the only thing we have now is the next gen consoles.
-----
mindsale: Because I’ll always appreciate games with the finest of textures, sound, and storytelling.

Neiteio: Because gamers have been asking for everything.

~!~Is there a way to get back into Pokemon?

Denman: I've gone through the same cycle of discovering Pokemon and catching them, then playing them again.
I've tried playing Let's Go the Yeti and it's been a tough journey. The games are accessible, I like the story and the way the region is used, and I like the simplicity of the games.
I do not like the fact that you're still in the wild, and it's a shame because I like Team Rocket.
I've tried playing Let's Go the Yeti and it's made me appreciate the game more. I feel like I'm playing the same game, and then I'm playing it without knowing any of the mechanics.
I've tried playing the trading card game and that was a step backwards. 
I've tried playing the Pokewalker game.
I've tried going to the Distant Worlds and it didn't really help, but I also tried playing the Safari Zone map and faught two Gens with Pikachu.
I tried going to gyms with every friend I have.
It's a shame because it's my favourite game, but that's not really a reason to play with others, it's more of a reason to appreciate the games and if you're struggling, but, man, I like Pokemon and I like this, it's better than playing with others.
Has anyone played Let's Go and are you struggling?
Help me out here. I need your help.
-----
Varibah: I've tried playing Safari Zone with every friend I have.
He hates me and he likes to smash me every time.
-----
Denman: Yeah I'm struggling a bit with catching Pokemon that you can't catch, especially when I don't know shit about catching Pokemon. It's a shame because you can play this game without knowing any of the mechanics.
-----
Piston: I think you have to catch a few Pokemon to evolve them, if you capture them you can catch them and catch them for a limited time.
There is a pidgey and a Pikachu and they are yours to kill.
-----
Atheerios: I haven't tried any of the games but I did try some of the Safari Zone (and Gyms) in Let's Go. They are more accessible than I was.
-----
Atheerios: Safari Zone is region 4
Gyms are

~!~In the pre-DMC era of Game Boy Advance software, Capcom was the best.

TheGamingNewsGuy: Ever since the release of Resident Evil Revelations 2 in 2001, Capcom has been on a roll. First they released Resident Evil 4, then Resident Evil 2 Remake and now over a dozen new IPs, all being first party titles. With that in mind, maybe it's not hard to think back to the Game Boy Advance. We are at least 5 more years into the 3DS' lifespan, with 4 new IPs (DRAGON QUEST, POKEMON, and THE GHOST will come out next year). This is Capcom's strongest period with a lot of great games in that time.
The World Complete with Capcom!
- Resident Evil™
- Monster Hunter Stories
- Street Fighter Anniversary
- Street Fighter II USA
- Megaman X Collection
- Street Fighter III: 3D World

~!~What's the best game to play in a bed?

TeddyShardik: I was very late to bed today and had a dream about playing my bed. I went to sleep next to my laptop (tablet) and I wondered if I should stay up until 4 am today. I need to play something that will not only be relaxing but also has a good atmosphere.
I have the following games that I was thinking about when thinking about bed playing :
Ocarina of Time (I only played this in bed)
Majora's Mask (I only played this in bed)
Metroid Prime Pinball
Mario & Luigi: Dream Team
-----
Omar310: The Legend of Zelda:
I'm supposed to be sleeping as well as cooking when I'm dreaming, so I sleep for about an hour.
-----
SolVanderlyn: Man, the bed I have is always my favorite. I love how cozy it is.
-----
Cess007: I sleep to three.
I do it sometimes, but I found it too much nowadays, especially since I'll sometimes have to have more free time.
-----
Kytes: Sleep two times a year.
-----
Ossom: Sleep 2 times every day. I sleep till my chest hurts.
-----
Pascal: I sleep when I feel like it, usually when I'm working or studying.
-----
Cess007: So many sleep animations. Man, this stuff is comical!
-----
KtotheRoc: Sleep two times a year.

I believe this is availble for folks at GS and Target during 4/30/19.
While I cannot guarantee if it is applicable elsewhere, I think this is a pretty good deal for those interested in games that won't be fully on sale during that time.

TailorDKS: If you are interested and buy it during that time, you can get it on Black Friday to get the price. 
Yes, I think it is applicable everywhere else.

Punished Dan: Thanks for the heads up, would have held off.

Kanann: Not available in the UK or Europe :(
Still on sale.

~!~How can Square Develop a Game?

Hieroph: SE has always been a sucker for in-your-face, enthusiastic players willing to take on their projects, and generally a lot of "gamey" games that are enjoyable enough to be fun. But the success of their games has been disheartening because they have always been in this awkward spot between classic JRPGs of its very first iteration and Action game design with its obsession with fast paced action. 
Now, with the recent FFVII Remake reveal, it seems that the project has been brewing for quite some time. Square is a company that can turn a profit, but when it comes to making good money, it is more difficult than it used to be. 
Their main concern is that if they don't release all this time, people will forget what made them who they are. 
This has been a common criticism that was mocked in the old days, but it isn't as prevalent as it is now. I still hear it all of my complaints, but let me break it down a bit: 
- Potential moneyhatting
- Potential hype surrounding a new Square Enix game
- Potential hype surrounding a Square Enix game's failure
- Avoiding answering a lot of Tabata's questions regarding a new Square Enix game
- Not going in completely new directions with the story or the new games
Now, these aren't my views, since I think they are based on long time ago and long time before, but let's say I had a similar reaction to Tabata as to how people react to various games.
So for me: 
A: Square Enix games were boring too. 
B: They have a long history of mediocre games
C: They are not really hyping a new Square Enix game. 
D: Yes they have games where you can grind and collect stuff, but they also don't really have games that are that kind of transition between JRPGs. 
What do you guys think?
-----
FiXalaS: I think Kof.
-----
MattX: Huh? No one asked for this?
-----
Bundy: They have the maximum amount of games in their backlog.
-----
Azajabar: I think it is time for a remake of FF7. I am not that big of a FF fan so I can see this being a hard sell

Bony Manifesto: That seems more Warframe-y than I would've expected, but still.

Deleted member 46641: I don't think I've ever seen a game on Switch in a trailer before.
Love me some Warframe but I'm not into mobile games so I'm not sure I'll have much time with it

~!~Nintendo Switch: new Firmware update (Ver. 6.1.0)

Lite_Agent: It's been two weeks since the Nintendo System's launch, and it's finally here. Switch firmware update (6.1.0) is finally out. It's completely safe with no known issues, yet at the same time it's not anything you'd expect.
A quick rundown of what's changed thus far (from what I remember read on here back in the week or so)
Spoiler: What's New
Spoiler: Emulator (unlocked with a patch)
Spoiler: Emulator (unlocked with a patch)
Spoiler: Emotion Details
I've had my PC since day one, and being a console only user I've never seen any big performance hit on my PC before the Emulator update hit.
Now, I know the emulator is not without some flaws and it's just a nice-ness to have, but it's still a bit disappointing to have all of the big games running on a single core instead of the blazing fast Nvidia GTX 1080/4A tech. At least the lack of any big issues means I'm not going to have to wait for the big update to play all of them again.
Are there any other users having performance issues on the Switch?
-----
Fularu: I’m not even sure there’s a difference between emulators and Steam
-----
InquisitorAles: I am not sure there is a difference. I think Emulators are more suited for fullscreen games, but I can't find any reports of emulator problems on steam?
-----
Lant_War: I tend to keep my switches in a cool room with an external TV, so even if I have the Switch to use for emulated games I'll play them anyway.
-----
Vena: It's been a great upgrade, thank you Nintendo!
-----
Stopdoor: I assume the difference between Steam and Nvidia is that emulators target the Switch, and Steam is targeting other platforms.
P.S. Also: I'd assume this doesn't track with other consoles, but that's just my honest opinion.
-----
Memento: Emulation is not a problem here.
-----
Solid: What's changed to happen?
-----
brokeastronaut: It's a system level difference.
It's not quite that big

I've got to admit that I thought it looked pretty mediocre.
Would love to see this style someday.
-----
Neoxon: I do hope they'll show up at Blizzcon, but I'm not hopeful. I hope they show up together as the "Competitive Mode" announced at Blizzcon in Blizzard Plaza.

Falchion: That was a fun trailer.

I'm looking for some great games to play on the Switch, and I want to know what you think about 2019, and what kinds of games you would like to see come to Switch?
-----
ASaiyan: I'll take one for the Switch.
-----
Kiraly: I'll wait for the Holidays.
-----
Razor Mom: Yeah, I'll wait for Switch.
-----
ASaiyan: We haven't had a Pokémon/Smash yet in 2019, right?
-----
Mcjmetroid: Nah, I want to play Smash.
It's not a big year for Switch though.
I'd go Days Gone.
-----
HStallion: There's a thread about it already lol
-----
Cartridge Games: Nintendo usually doesn’t put their games out for a good chunk of their games until they feel like it. 
If nothing comes out before E3, I’ll probably wait
-----
Phantom Thief: I’ll wait once in a blue moon
-----
Atheerios: I'm hoping we get a Zelda or Smash game for the Switch.

ADee: I'm a huge fan of Xenogears and it never fails to grab my attention. I know it's a bit average but it is charming and the story is light hearted. Ive heard the story is light hearted as well and the characters are nice.
I just wanted to play another game in the same style and tone but I don't have the money to play it before the Torna expansion comes out.
I heard the story is light hearted and it actually has a story?
-----
FiXalaS: If you like the game you should play it.
I loved the gameplay, story was light hearted, and the characters were likable.
-----
tsab: I played the first chapters last week and it's good.
-----
adee: I am a big fan of the series and I played the first few chapters last week and it's great. So far a lot of news I read is that the world is great and it's a lot more interesting than the first game.
-----
LycanXIII: The story is light hearted.
-----
adee: I wish. I hope I could get it. 
Can’t wait to play it!
-----
FiXalaS: I'll read back if you enjoy it.

Dark Cloud: I want it.

I'll add a picture when it is ready.
-----
FiXalaS: will it feature the cleaners from the final?
-----
CormoranStrike: The cleaners aren't much better than the last cleaner.
-----
Zalman: I love the game but the cleaner is a little dim in that area.
-----
LordKano: inb4 people complaining about resolution on Switch
-----
ASaiyan: How much do they actually know?
-----
skittzo0413: Um, this thread is going to devolve into people complaining about the resolution.
-----
GustyGardner: The cleaner looks great, especially in the beginning. The colorful color palette is a little dull to me. It starts off with a good color palette and gradually drifts toward greys. It's a nice color transition but then it gradually drifts towards the darker reds and greens. It has a fantastic final color balance to it.
-----
LordKano: it's not the best version but it's at least decent.
-----


====================
~!~LTTP: Super Mario Bros.

asmith906: I don't have time to write this but I just finally beat this game.
It's so good. The music, the vibe, the amount of Toadette fans, the story... I just loved it. It's one of my favorite games ever and I am so sad that it's been passed down to its very end. The game is a joy to play and I hope Nintendo doesn't kill the 3D world of the game forever. I just hope they give us a sequel.
-----
Jahranimo: Glad you enjoyed it OP! I'm gonna mention that I had a great time with the game. The platforming, the boss fights and the art style are all so pleasing. I can't wait for the sequel.
-----
FairyEmpire: I enjoyed it as well, but the more I played it, the more I realised that great platforming can only come from a few well-liked developers, not a mass-effect like the original. It's hard to rank the game's greatness, because you can't really compare it to the original, but I do think the new levels were a little too loose, and the final boss was a little too hard. Still, the game had some of the best platforming this gen, and while the sequel is more ambitious, it's still a joy to play.
-----
FairyEmpire: I loved the game overall, but I could never get into the final levels of the first game. I didn't play the second game until March, but I remember it being very challenging and frustrating, especially when it came to the final boss. I think the game peaked at the end and I was no longer interested.
-----
asmith906: Yeah it's definitely one of the best 2d platformers of the past three or so years. I remember playing it on Gamecube, was really good at it even though I didn't have a lot of platforming abilities. I think I beat the first game back when it came out on the GCN. I'm glad you enjoyed it!

====================
~!~Hey, remember: Rocket League?

CanUKlehead: So I just got Rocket League for my Xbone X, it was free on Xbox Live and on Gamepass and I was thinking how I miss this brand new Rocket League game. It is so much fun.
Well, when it launched in November, I thought it had been forgotten.
Back then, I thought Looter shooter was dead.
Now I see it frequently on the Xbox Store and in the Jump Force section, and it is tempting to use it.
But I still can't believe they retooled it into a fully successful franchise.
I know it looked terrible on Xbox but I still need to be grateful for it.
-----
JEFFREY GRUBB: It's a great game. It's a shame that it's fallen so low compared to the likes of Overwatch and Fortnite. I wish them the best of luck with their future plans though.
-----
HockeyGuy412: It is a really good game
-----
Spinluck: It's a fun game. I don't think it's the type of game to waste money on but it's certainly different from the others I had a try when I played it.
-----
Klobrille: I never played Rocket League but it was fun when I did.
-----
Theorry: Yeah. But with the dev of this game making money, it is kinda crazy.
-----
Hieroph: It's a fun game that is nothing like Overwatch. But yeah, pay money for more content.
-----
JigglesBunny: Rocket League is still a really good game, here’s to many chances to win cosmetic items, loot boxes and the ability to grind for high scores.
-----
Spinluck: I honestly have no idea how to even enjoy it. I'm just reading about the dev doing a shareware game called "The Crew".
-----
Dest: It's still a fun game, but I'm not sure why it's been dunked on so much.

====================
~!~LTTP: Resident Evil 7, I'm not a fan of Survival-Horror

WrenchNinja: So I bought the Resident Evil 7 Remake on sale and played it for the first time. I had never played a survival horror before. The first time I came to this conclusion I remembered that this game was a masterpiece. I'll start it off with a small favor.
I'm pretty sure this game is a literal bible of horror games. This is the first time in a while I found myself going through a section of video games where I was playing as a zombie. I'm a grown ass man. Here is a mom and a son in an apartment.
I can only imagine how much the Resident Evil series has cultivated over the years. Resident Evil is so prominent that even the 3 mainline titles are all heavily cribbing from this formula, and it's why I think my first proper horror game was the first Resident Evil on the PS1. Like, I can't believe I'm playing this game.
I'll play with the most ammunition I have when I say that I'm actually loving this game. Namely, the soundtracks. The opening theme is stuck in my head, but that is because I've been trying to get used to it. It's stuck in my head, and it's not just that. It's that the music used in the opening is seriously overused. It's the music in the game that just makes the experience more tense.
I'm not going to say that the music in this game is bad, but I do think it's over-used.
What are your favorite tracks?
-----
Funyarinpa: This game fucking rocked. 
The atmosphere, the music and the atmosphere. It's like a second life in to the Resident Evil series.
-----
Holly: Played the entire PSOne version for the first time last year. Still such a masterpiece.
-----
WrenchNinja: The soundtrack is legit. I can't beat that music.
I put this song in my startup playlist for the first time in years.
-----
MrNewVegas: The music was just so good. The first time I heard the music playing while moving around was such a wow moment.
-----
Cartridge Games: Played the first 3 games and RE7 last year and they were really good.
Re7 was also really good.

====================
~!~Do you think we'll see a Switch revision at some point?

Jawmuncher: This is something I would have thought, but I got an email from Nintendo announcing a Switch revision. 
It seems to be a huge improvement. 
Not a big deal for me, but a nice improvement nonetheless.
This doesn't exactly sit right with me too much. The main problem with a Switch is that the console is so-called "casual" console. When I think of a Switch (especially a handheld) there is no doubt that it is the "casual" console (With a bigger screen). However, when I think of Switch-kids there is a LOT of kids there.
There is no question that Switch is a "casual" console. However, it does feel different. While this is nothing new, it's actually been getting new revisions every 2-3 years. Which is a bummer, because it's one of the most anticipated features of this generation.
The other thing I'm glad about is that there are lots of games that'll take advantage of the Switch. Fortnite is one of the most popular multiplayer games right now. While that might not sound bad, a lot of games would benefit from a port on the Switch. For example, Minecraft. While it's still a great game and has an awesome art style, it's simply more "clicky". 
Another example of a game that would benefit from a port is Bloodborne. While it has a lot of issues, there is no doubt that it will be one of the best "indie" title of the generation. While I don't know if it would be as memorable as a GTA title or a Spider-Man title, it's certainly a game I would get hyped for. 
Do you think we'll get a revision at some point?
-----
yuoke: Not really. They just need to take the Switch on a lot of things but they already started with the launch windows.
-----
Noppie: I think there is a chance. I think it will be a PS5 console, but yeah, the launch will be a bit too short.
-----
Cartridge Games: They’ll probably reboot it or make it a new IP or sequel.
Maybe spin it into a souped up co-op game or something.
They already did a sequel and then made a revision

~!~Polygon: "The Utopia Project: The Final Smash Bros. " Project Retro meets Final Smash (Lan Van Down High)

TheGamingNewsGuy: Polygon Published their article on the news of Retro Studios' next title "The Utopia Project"
10/23
-----
Silky: We're gonna get Pikachus too
-----
Imran: The Utopia Project is a brand-new franchise that is loosely based on the Mario and Luigi series, made up of brand-new IPs and spinoffs from their time in the NES and Super Famicom. They've done some actual work, and it'll be interesting to see how Nintendo handling the title, but I'll be fully involved in whatever they do.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: Yeah they should, it was mentioned in the Luigi's Mansion thread that Luigi's Balloon World was a thing and they did a really fun thing of not doing it
-----
Imran: I think it's about time for Nintendo to make a new Mario or Zelda game.
-----
VDenter: Pikassas and Diddy are on a roll.
-----

Phantom Thief: I’m in, I’m ready.
-----
DrArchon: I've been playing the series for nearly 20 years and I hope we get one, because everything they've shown in the games has been 99% my opinion.
The series is not perfect, but they've made some of my favorites.

~!~The Next DEATH BITE: "Escape Room" aka "Escape Room 2"

GiantHurtBall: "The Next DEATH BITE is coming to PS4 and Xbox One as well, according to its developer," GamesBeat. "The game is coming to PS4 and Xbox One next month, and is also coming to Switch. The game was previously a timed exclusive and was taking a bit of time out on Steam as a result."
-----
Memento: Oh boy..
-----
BubbleButt64: Great
-----
GiantHurtBall: I don't know if I need an added thread for this, but this is a really cool feature to see.
-----
Toumari: They need to bring back escape room.
-----

TheInfinityGauntlet: Huh that's nice
-----
Omar310: I wonder if escape room is a game-related peripheral or if escape room is a game feature.
-----
KoolAid: Oh man, that's a good addition to the list to see how much escape room there is.
-----
poussi: Yeeeeahhhhh I love it.

====================
~!~Why didn't someone with a copy of Yakuza 6 on Game Pass put it in?

D65: The name of the game makes it sound like it's a remake of the original game. I just found out that Yakuza 6 is on Game Pass and I wonder why it never was on other platforms.
Should I wait for the PS5 version?
-----
Samanosuke Akechi: Why would you put it in the title?
-----
Blue Lou: I thought it was the PS4 version?
-----
Bansai: No, just Yakuza 6.
I've played the game twice on the service, once on the PC and once on PS4. I didn't have a copy in my box or drive.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: Yakuza 6 on PC yes.
-----
daxy: I'd have to assume no. But I just bought Yakuza 5 on there, so I'd wait for 6.
-----
D65: That's not a lot of room on my wallet.
-----
Distantmantra: I’m wondering if this is a dealbreaker for anyone. I’ve just bought Yakuza 6 twice on Steam. Once on PS4, and once on PC. So I’d wait for 6.
-----
MrLuchador: I’d wait for Yakuza 6 because I can play the entire series through PS+.

====================
~!~Why is the control stick not part of Smash Ultimate?

Kylo Rey: This is confusing, it seems like it's just barely being used in handheld mode compared to Smash. I know it's not a Nintendo exclusive thing but I am always baffled by the lack of any quality control with most third party games on the Switch.
So if you look at the images below it's not part of Smash.
Spoiler
-----
Mediking: Boooooo...
-----
Seven Force: It's just Nintendo. They've never cared about making games in a consistent sense. They care only about the people who like them.
-----
Khanimus: Nintendoomed
-----
Khanimus: .
-----
J75: It's a Nintendo thing to be honest.
-----
Chauzu: I’m not a Smash fan. Such a weird thing to have a control stick attached to my tv.
-----
Pancracio17: It's a Nintendo thing
-----
Kaz Mk II: It doesn't really have to be Nintendo to have a control stick in a Nintendo exclusive game.
-----
Kylo Rey: No it was a thing to have in Brawl.
