~!~What's the hype for Starfield?

J_ToSaveTheDay: I've just finished reading an EGM article about Starfield, a game that was revealed last year. I've only just now started the game myself, but I'm finding the hype for this game so high.
I've heard that the game is actually a lot of fun, and that's a great description of what the game is about. I'm intrigued, but the last time I played the game I had little interest in the story and world, and this game seems to fix that.
I've been following the game on Twitter, and found it odd, as you'd expect a Starfield game, but the game itself seems very interesting. I found the wiki entry on Twitter to be very interesting, too.
The thing that's odd about a lot of my Starfield hype is that it's a pretty standard shooter with Starfield tech-wise, and it doesn't really fit that convention. I can see why that would be, since the game is basically a MOBA clone, but the fact that it's a sci-fi RPG really makes it work for me. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of aspects of the game, and this article is really promising for that.
I'm interested in the game, and I'm especially interested in the characters, but I'm also concerned about some of the things that I didn't know about it beforehand.
-----
TheMoon: Unlikely yet! Sorry OP, but this article is going to be a huge part of my day.
-----
Katsubento: I honestly thought it would be Starfield but I wasn't expecting this game to have a sci-fi theme.
-----
the_wart: It's not that what it says makes it likely. But it's not looking good.
-----
Kyoufu: I'm sure the game will be good, but the tech is not what I expected.
-----
TheMoon: Starfield is being made by Crytek's Crystasis team (Crystar) in collaboration with Uni.
-----
Benji: I was worried it was going to be Star Fox x Kirby Star Allies
-----
Flux: I was expecting this, but seems like it's actually shaping up to be good.
-----
TheMoon: Well, it's not gonna be Starfield.
Nope, it's not

~!~WWE 2K19 is the best wrestling game of all time

Solidsnakejej: A 14 year old me who has never gotten to the WrestleKingdom 4 ring of mainwars has now got to play as the best wrestling game of all time.
WWE 2K19 is the first game to put the best wrestlers in onscreen at once with the addition of wrestlers from across the WWE Universe. And it has been a phenomenal experience.
I honestly can't think of a single downside to the game, and it's my favorite WWE game in general.
How about you guys?
-----
vestan: The gameplay alone is the biggest reason I've had such a good time with the game. The story is surprisingly good and really well done. Match after match is easily the best part of a wrestling game imo.
-----
Silky: WWE 2K19 is the best wrestling game of all time
-----
Master Milk: has the best match in the entire wix universe
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: But its not even a comparison
The wix games are better than the WWE games in many ways
-----
SolidChamp: I love everything I heard about WO4.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The core gameplay is super fun, the art style, the graphics, the music, the gameplay, the story.
-----
Porygon: God, this game is a treat. The story, the art style, the music, it's an all around great and inventive game.
-----
Cordy: The game itself is amazing. The story and the wrestling matches are all amazing and fresh.
-----
Neoxon: Can't wait for match after match, especially when you consider the fact that no matches were set up in the ring in the first game.
-----

====================
~!~BOTW: The first time I started the game

kubev: It's been almost 6 years since I started this game, but I remember being pretty excited about the lock-on system and being done with the game. While I still think the game is fantastic, I've come to feel a bit lost, or maybe it's just that I can't remember exactly what's been done better. With the game, I've been able to play the entire first dungeon at least, and I've enjoyed the game for quite a while. I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest of the game as well, but I remember feeling like I was missing something. Is there anything I'm missing that I'm not getting?
-----
Yoshichan: The lock-on system was actually the reason why I made this thread.
-----
Phendrift: It’s not locked on the first dungeon.
It’s based on the third dungeon and is all over the place on the BOTW part.
-----
jchap: I think you're missing a few dungeons.
-----
kubev: You're missing two. The first is when you're riding on the horse, and the second is when you go to the Great Plateau.
-----
TheBuschMan94: No lock-on, first dungeon is like a bootleg Z targeting your head.
-----
BocoDragon: You can't go into the Plateau and climb the mountains.
-----
TheBaldwin: The lock-on system was a thing, the first dungeons are linear hell in terms, just like the first souls game.
They added more puzzles than you would be able to imagine, and some of those puzzles are harder than the ones in the first game (think of the tower in the middle of the cave, kaerim, fiend's kingdom, and next area).
The first dungeon is more linear.
They made a new optional dungeon called Elemental Caverns, where you can get into the main game as you would in the first place by now.
-----
kubev: Yeah, I know. I'll just leave that there.
-----
takufox: No lock on was a thing in the first game as well, that always annoyed me.

~!~Looking for a new PC game for short

dishonestjest: I've had a bit of a backlog lately, and something I can't help but be looking for something other than the usual RPGs. I don't mind going for something like RE2 or Binding of Issac, but something more akin to a third person shooter (I.E. Battlefield, Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls, Quake) and I have a few more games in my steam library I'm interested in trying.
I'm looking for games I can play while watching the on-board, or streamed, or listening to streaming sound from a gamepad.
Games: 
-Anything with a twitch channel. Anything with a twitch channel. Anything.
I've got a laptop and a Xbox One X. I'm open to suggestions too.

~!~The House In Fata Morgana: A Requiem for Innocence PS4 English trailer

vestan: Yakuza 0 released on June 26th 2018 and its been out for months, so you probably know about its existence already. It was also announced for Japan on August 9th 2018 which is when it was pulled from the west.
However, here it is, releasing on August 9th 2018. It's not out in the west yet, and the trailer is just one of the many ways fans are supposed to feel that it's coming out in the west. So, here you have the first official confirmation of the release date. It's releasing on June 26th 2018 in Japan on PS4.
-----
Lant_War: Well, this was expected. I'm sure the western audience will have their fill of Rin, and the rest of the world will probably get to play it sooner rather than later.
-----
King of Dreamland: I'm not expecting anything because of the lack of console release.
-----
GoldStarz: I'm guessing the western release date is June 29th.
-----
DangerMouse: It's a very weird trailer to release based on the same trailer we had last time around, and I'm fine with that. 
I wonder how they'll handle the English audio, since it sounds like they've yet to use English audio for the trailer.
-----
Memento: I mean, it is the same song, right?
-----
KoolAid: I'm sure the western release is coming on June 29th.
-----
TheRaidenPT: Well I mean, the song is the Japanese release right?
-----
Magic Mushroom: That's not the song we were expecting.
-----
DangerMouse: Yeah, I mean, the song was originally taken, but the trailer isn't even out yet!

~!~Switch version of Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers announced for Japan

King of Dreamland: There was a thread earlier about it, but now we have a port announcement.
The game was announced at the end of the 12-month Japan Expo, and it seems to be coming out on Switch in Japan at the end of the month! So we’ve got an English translation confirmation.
As far as we know, the game will be PS4/Vita/Switch/PC, and will also be coming to the Nintendo eShop in Japan.

Omar310: Oh yeah, I'm just not feeling these.

King of Dreamland: I don't know what I was expecting.

~!~Is it time for Nintendo to start paying more for online?

Pablo Mesa: I know Nintendo used to have a lot of fumbles with Sony over the online component but the initial online paywall was fixed on a day one patch and it has been free for the most part since then.
Now the major difference is that Nintendo is getting a cut of 25%, which is nothing to write with it.
Now when Sony added the online paywall in the first place, they got a 30% cut.
So the question is when will they start charging more, or before they have to pay Nintendo for it?
-----
ILikeFeet: No. I believe the online paywall is not without its issues. but I think it's more on them to encourage third party to pay for the services they don't have a history of supporting.
-----
FluxWaveZ: No, because it would take them until 2022 to formally acknowledge their online paywall. They've been doing it since the launch of the Switch.
-----
pauloshinobi: They have to start charging more.
-----
60EffPeeEss: Because they already have a business model that's not remotely appealing to the majority of gamers that don't care about the paywall.
-----
Sander VF: Wait, they only recently had one?
-----
Pablo Mesa: Wait, but that was before the switch launch?
-----
Pablo Mesa: the reason why they do this is because of the online paywall.
-----
lvl 99 Pixel: They did get a big warning last September, but they responded with a patch so they could officially start charging. I hope they do it again this year
-----
Deleted member 43077: They should start charging for online.

~!~Why aren't there more anime games with a Kage character?

Thebeast!: I would love a shonen anime with a kameko character. I mean look at the nth psp game that's been released so far and there is like zero of an anime or with serousugfinity and you can see the anime in action.
-----
Lord Vatek: This is one of the things I always liked about the Naruto games in general. I'm pretty sure that the game is just a compilation of Naruto Shippuden games.
-----
Thebeast!: Kage
-----
Thebeast!: I would like to know why
-----
Cordy: I think it's because the games are tendst to be transition shooters from their respective franchises. I think Gears of war is a good example of this, it's a first person ps2 fps/shooter. Then again, this is assuming a lot of the games are open world.
-----
Thebeast!: I hope they bring back the arc of rpgs
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I'm glad we are getting a new Dragon Ball game.
-----
Sagadego17: KOF is the only one with a Kage character...what's the point.
-----
Thebeast!: I dont think that's the case

====================
~!~What is the best version of the Battlefield 1 “E3” event?

Bman94: I’m starting to wonder if EA plans on doing this event in the next game or if they are just going for the spectacle and the excitement of the moment. Why is this event exclusive to the E3 Showcase? Is it exclusive to the E3 Showcase in general? Is it exclusive to Battlefield 4? There was a decent amount of discussion in the official forums about this event and if they are going in this style, how to handle it. I’d love to see a BF event in the BF4 engine style demo.
A Battlefield event would be good but I’d love to see this event in the BF4 engine style demo included in the final game.
What do you guys think?
-----
Sjay1994: I would argue that they are doing this event in the BF4 engine style demo in the final game, just in the beta.
-----
B00T: I think they're doing this event in BF4, but that was pre-release and was just a quick one. Like "you can play that demo right now", they're doing the event in that engine demo.
Edit: Never mind, I thought they were doing the event in BF4, so maybe to me that's a unique event.
-----
c0Zm1c: I believe they're doing this for the event in Battlefield 4 and it's a short thing. There's not a lot to it. I think it's more about the summary of the event and the event build.
-----
Maneil99: Is the beta coming to BF4?
-----
Garrett 2U: Would be cool to see a BF1 or BF4 live.
-----
HockeyGuy412: You can play this demo on the demo disc, the build will be available to all BFV players and the full game
-----
Bhonar: I can see these events being a way to boost engagement in the BF community
-----
Uncle Sensei: I love the BF events. I would love a demo. 
Get the full campaign experience and then open it up to all BFV players. That's all I'd ask for.
-----
skeezx: this sounds like it's going to be a huge flop in a lot of ways, but i

~!~Is the new CoD WWII on PS4 the most disappointing WW2 game to date?

Fiery Phoenix: I don't really see what the fuss is about.
- There are numbers of people who bought WW2 editions as well.
- The game is still playable on PC, and none of the maps are really visually interesting, though it's quite dated so maybe they're still working on the maps.
- The tone of the game is notably less visually interesting.
- Maybe the new CoD is less interesting.
- Maybe the blackout map is the most disappointing one.
- Maybe they changed the setting to a desert but it doesn't really feel deserty.
- Maybe the new CoD is less interesting, at least aesthetically.
- I have no idea, the new CoD is also a day one launch game.
I'm a little torn up. I'm almost ready to buy it, but I don't know when.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: It’s a very disappointing WW2 game. It’s a shame because I love CoD and I love the setting.
-----
LossAversion: Not really. I thought it was very disappointing and a bit bland. It's not like WWII shooters or shooters with much fire. It's a game that's mostly about propaganda and stat buffs. The tone of the game isn't really that interesting.
-----
Lackless: You can't compare WW2 games and it's changed so much. It's not a good or bad game.
The new CoD is one of the most disappointing games I've played in years.
-----
Baccus: I really liked it.
-----
Yossarian: I don’t think it’s a good game, but it’s a great shooter.
-----
Femto0: I didn't enjoy it at all.wasn't fun to shoot at targets.
-----
Skel: I thought it was a decent game though. Not sure what the change will be. I definitely hope they keep the WW2 gameplay intact.
-----
Finaika: The tone is not really good.
-----
LossAversion: I'm glad I said this with no qualifiers.
-----

====================
~!~Games you liked more than others

Revolsin: I'm still not over how far Detroit was in terms of gameplay
-----
leng jai: Red Dead Redemption 2. 
I beat it in a couple of days and I loved it.
-----
Ahasverus: Monster Hunter World.
It's so grindy, but there's so much fun to be had.
-----
Kass: I'd put God of War in the latter category.
-----
Poutine Runner 2049: Horizon Zero Dawn.
Hearing that it was a linear story based game made me extremely skeptical of any future open world game.
-----
BubbleButt64: I enjoyed The Witcher 3 more than any open world game I've played this year.
-----
kvetcha: Yeah, I was gonna mention Fallout 76.
-----
Toumari: Red Dead Redemption 2. 
First time playing this since christmas and it's so fucking fun.
-----
kvetcha: Or MGS V.
First time since my early 2010s and just started again.
-----
Kyoufu: Red Dead Redemption 2.

~!~I have a 4K HDR TV

TheRaidenPT: I have a 4K HDR TV and am trying to decide if I should wait for a better deal or just watch the E3 trailer on YouTube and see if I get a better deal.
I know the TV is used for Sony Goldswappable HDR but I was wondering if people had suggestions on which TV to expect the best HDR implementation for. I know some people say they do not but I was wondering if others had any suggestions or seen anybody confirm the same.
Thanks!
-----
Kenzodielocke: The 4k LG U9000 is LG's standard
-----
Riderz1337: I have a Sony 900E. It’s what I got for my Scorpio set.
-----
TheRaidenPT: I have a base model 1080p TV that I was getting for $160. I don't care for HDR.
-----
Fahzzy: Have you got the TV in the back to use the maximum possible signal output of the HDMI port?
I have the 55 inch one and it's looking a lot better than I expected!
The only things I'm not sure about the implementation is that the game is supposed to look better on the TV. Is that literally just you settings or does the game still look better on 1080p?
-----
TheRaidenPT: The TV's back is just the signal bar and the back of the HDMI port.
I got the TV back to the max d's so I don't really notice a difference
-----
Dinjooh: I’ve had a 49 inch for a long time, and I’ve been happy with it. It’s a great TV, and the HDR is great.
I think I’m going to wait a bit... Might eventually upgrade to a 65 inch.
-----
TheRaidenPT: Yeah I just reviewed the game and thought it looked amazing.
-----
ElBoxyBrown: The 4k LG U9000 is the standard set by Dolby at the moment. I have the 49inch version and have had better results with HDR10 on the TV (dubbed the "gold" version), but I've had a different experience with Dolby Atmos.

====================
~!~I’m enjoying RDR2 but I’m worried about its quality

Maxey: It looks like RDR2 is not exactly an open world game like most open world games.
I am very excited about this game and it is a lot of fun so far.
The controls and movement seem to be able to adapt to my hands. I haven’t had any issues with them so far.
The framerate is good and I think that's it.
The game looks great and it looks great. I’m mainly loving the lighting effects.
It’s not going to play like Witcher 3 or GoW but I can see why people are worried.
I don’t mind the small details at all. I feel like those things would distract me more than it’s design since it’s not open world.
However, I’m not sure how I feel about the quality of the framerate.
I’m mainly interested in the world design and how it’s utilized. Does it have some of the open world and sandbox aspects?
I’m playing on an XB1X, so I can play on a 27” elevated.
I can also play with my hands and the ability to move the camera and strafe while aiming. Is that something you can do on the XB1X? Maybe other versions of the game?
-----
hank_tree: It's very different from the open world games you’re describing. Open world games are big stuff and they’re not linear experiences. They are open world games and they can be hugely interconnected. I love open world games because I can play the game I want to and it’s not as if I’m playing a prequel to another open world game.
-----
Maxey: That's not what I'm getting at.
You can probably play the game in L.A. without motion control.
The game's not open world, but it's not linear either.
-----
Xavier: I feel like I am in the same boat.
I played the game and have had zero issues, it's just the first impression I got is that the game is linear.
-----
Maxey: Ooh, interesting.
-----
Soundchaser: You can, but you can only play in the options
====================
~!~Games similar to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where you pick a Link?

Cybersai: I saw this video a few days ago and it got me thinking about Breath of the Wild and I was playing it on my phone. The game is very similar to Zelda in it's scale, but the whole point of the game is the same: you fight a boss for honor, you are the legend who gave you the sword, and you are in it all.
Now, I have a lot of different memories and appreciation for Zelda, but I find it hard to appreciate those things for a number of reasons.
One is the spirit of the game. The feeling when you are playing a game that you believed to be a culmination of all the previous ones and then you see a whole different story. The feeling when you see a whole new town, a whole new world, or a whole new style of game for a fresh experience. It is the spirit that keeps me coming back to the game.
The second is the game's design. It's similar to Zelda in a way. There is a sense of adventure and discovery, but there is something about the game that keeps me going back to it.
The games I've been playing so far have been Fiends and Dungeons. They're about running from baddies and filling the environment with humans and other races. Dungeons are all about learning and learning, learning to live, learning to deal with things that don't matter. For me, Dungeons tend to be a kind of a blur, but I also know that I'm going to be playing the game for a number of hours, and I'm not going to be going to the Boardwalk. I know that this is my fate to learn to live, but I don't know yet.
The game's design is very similar to Zelda in that it is hard as nails to overcome challenges and it has a sense of mystery to it. The reason for that is that you are in the shoes of some magical fairy, that is. The game's design is very much about learning to live for a purpose. It seems like it is going to be really rewarding when you achieve that and it is just a lot of fun to do.
Now I am only just hitting a wall on one of the dungeons because I want to do some of the other dungeons I can.
Bonus:
Spoiler
I know that the game is not nearly as special
====================
~!~RTTP: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers

mogster7777: I haven’t played this game in years but I remember quite enjoying this game when I played it back in the PS2. It’s a bit grindy and a bit short but it was a great dungeon crawler about FF characters dealing with time travel. I absolutely adored the art direction which was a great choice for this game. I never really followed the series since I don’t really follow the Crystal Chronicles franchise. I’ve always wanted to play this game but it has been a while since I got around to it.
I love the music and the sound effects are great. The boss fights are a bit repetitive but that can be partly covered by great gimmick stage music. The music in this game is just so good.
I’ve never played the DS version but I remember liking how the crystals looked. The music in this game is generic fantasy music but it works very well.
I love the way you have to fight the seven beasts. The bosses are mostly just variations of FF8’s final boss fights. Then there are the magic beasts which are awesome. There are so many spells and arts in this game which are used for great effect.
I love the turn based combat. The game really throws those fights into the best of one, making them feel great at least for me. There are tons of ways to get these orbs to drop.
The batshit insane jump and swing combat is fun. The jumping is slick too.
I like how the openings are long and challenging with the rythm of the combat.
Also the way you fight the enemies is fun. It’s a shame the game has never gotten a HD port. The original was a slog and I never got to finish it because of it.
I think the worst thing about this game for me was the awful tbh. I never felt powerful enough to overpower them all. I could have gone on a strength run and defeated every single one of them easily. The enemies were all fun to fight in the game for me.
Overall I think Crystal Chronicles is one of the best Square games of the generation and one of the most underrated modern jrpg. I really enjoyed the combat and the world and atmosphere was great. I liked the story so far. I liked how the game has more than enough to keep you engaged
====================
~!~I'd like to play as a Woman in a game, preferably with male characters

SolVanderlyn: I live in a world where women are almost guaranteed to be white and/or asexual. My earliest, the first game I played as a girl, was complete trash. I refuse to play it again. I have a theory that this is why the anime exist and why the game's female characters are so tropey. The game's female characters are executed so well that it's actually easy to imagine them.
The first game I played as a woman was Resident Evil 4. I have no idea why this is popular, it's just believable.
And I started this game, and this is kind of impossible. I can't imagine playing as a woman in a shooter. How do you do something that's so realistic and believable? How do you handle the power dynamics? How do you play the same women and men?
I'm not saying that I'm playing a woman to have a safe and grounded experience, I'm just playing with female characters.
I guess the problem is that there are so many possibilities on how to handle this. Are there even any safe and grounded female protagonists?
I would like to play as a white woman in a game. What would her experience be like? What would her fantasy/alternate story world story look like? What sort of gameplay would she have?
-edit: I have a point, like I said I'm playing with female characters, I'm talking about playing as a woman in a game. And I can't even remember how the game handled the fantasy/alternative universe of the game.
-----
GavinUK86: I don't know about the safe mode, but I'd assume it would be playing as a different character than playing as a white woman.
-----
Crayon: I have played as a woman.
-----
UsoEwin: Play as a woman.
-----
Phendrift: Play as a woman. That’s it.
-----
Aigis: I do a lot of skin color and nothing else, its been a while since I played a game with a black woman. Just play as a woman. Its been a while since I played a black woman in a shooter. It took me a while to actually play as a white character. I understand, for example, that GTAV is full of female characters. But

"More than a year in."
"Part 2 is coming at...

~!~Does anyone have a better gaming summary sheet than this?

TheGhost: A lot of the time the content is just better in person. I’ve just been rewatching a bunch of movies and TV shows and it seems like the consensus is that the presence of awesome people together is better than it ever was. I’ve never seen a game overshadow that also has some of my favorite characters.
I don’t know what I’m supposed to be playing, but I guess I’m playing the role of the superior race.
I’m gonna be rewatching more of the movies and TV shows and it’s not even that.:lol
-----
jviggy43: The most important part of a VN is the story. So no. Everything else is a guide to be better at it.
-----
TheGhost: I never played a game that wasn’t a perfect story.
-----
Dardan Sandiego: The best is playing the game to see the brillant points and steps in the plot they wanted to set up. The worst is watching the movie and reading the books and seeing the game play out the whole time.
-----
spindashing: I think you're doing yourself a disservice by ignoring Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
The main point of that game is the plot is so brilliant, but it doesn't matter if you don't play as Ezio.
-----
TheGhost: I never understood how people played on a mic =O
-----
TheGhost: I got to watch the movie and the book and it was pretty great.
-----
Riversands: I played AC:O on the mic, and the story is the best the series has had, maybe im too young to really understand it, but I have no trouble finishing it.
-----
SofNascimento: I'd say play as a badass warrior. I don't think you can play as a badass, but with a badass protagonist you can play as yourself.

Krejlooc: The best part of a VN is the story. That doesn't mean the movies are a guide, it means they're trying to make sense of the characters and their motivations, not making them too likeable.

~!~What is your favourite part of the Nier Automata Soundtrack?

CannonFodder52: I've only ever played Automata but I loved the soundtrack as much as the game itself. In particular, the chiptune parts. 
Anyway, after coming off of the Berseria-like opening, the track itself becomes a big, huge notch. 
What is your favourite part of the soundtrack? What does it feel like to play the game? What kind of music do you enjoy listening to it?
-----
vestan: A huge part of the soundtrack is the use of chiptune. The use of the chiptune fast movements are off the charts in the gaming side forums for me.
-----
Grunge_Hamster: Great soundtrack.
-----
Starlatine: The tracks never lose their edge
Would love to play more but I think this one is really lowkey one of the best
-----
HylianSeven: It's got to be the chiptune parts. I think the actual gameplay music is good but I think the rest of the soundtrack is average.
-----
CannonFodder52: I’m going to assume this is one of the official tracks. 
There were chiptune parts in the game but they tended to be used for the more standard RPG and hunting aspects.
-----
Funny Valentine: For the first 30 seconds of Automata I was thinking the same thing. Then I thought it was great and didn’t really hear it. Then I thought it was terrible.
-----
Tribal24: Yea it's awful. Such a nice song. What the hell is up with other games? I love it. The game itself is really good.
-----
Svart: "In the land of the dreams..."
-----
varkuriru: I'm not sure but I love the chiptune parts in the FF7 soundtrack.
It's the best I've heard in a game.

~!~Stories that you and your loved ones never knew about

SolVanderlyn: I love reading the stories in games, and this thread is the first in a series looking back at the stories and games that inspired this hobby.
I don't think I've ever had a story/game/writers before me (but I'm curious) ever have a story/game/writer say to me "This is so awesome, just read this line immediately. It's like someone said to me, 'It's Yoko Taro', and I was like "man, man, that's so awesome. I've never thought anything like that before." I've never seen a writer like that before me.
What stories or games or games about you had a story tell you?
-----
Birdseye: The one about Donkey Kong Jr.
-----
CannonFodder52: Kingdom Hearts, one of my favorite games ever, and I think that's something I don't think any other series has managed to manage.
-----
Boddy: Far Cry 3.
I was in a Nutshell when it came out. I thought it was a pretty cool character study.
I watched a friend play through the entire game using a guide for early parts of the game and was so overwhelmed when I finally understood how to do every part of the game.
-----
Kromeo: I don’t think any other JRPG, any media other than books has ever managed to grab me.
-----
Vincent Alexander: This is a great one. I have to say that I feel the writing for Chrono Trigger is also great.
-----
cecilpaladin32: My initial JRPG experience was kind of sour since I was never a fan of the original Vagrant Story. I think it's because I used to play RPGs to get a look at new stories from the 90s and thought I was crazy. 
I always had a aversion to RPG games, though, and never got into the sequels. The first game in particular, was always a disappointment.
-----
Svart: I love stories about characters and stories about worlds.
My favourite is probably the first game in the Shin Megami Tensei series, I liked it the most.
-----
Cantaim: The original Super Mario Bros. I loved it.
-----
Aigis: This was the first game I ever heard
====================
~!~Do you think the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X will ever be capable of 4K UHD discs?

GoldenKings: So I just finished the game and wow.
The games that I can't wait for are all PS4 Pro and Xbox One games.
Games like God of War, Spider-Man, Detroit, Tomb Raider, and some Assassin's Creed games.
I wonder if it will ever be possible to native 4K discs. I know that most of the disc-less Japanese RPGs (aka Final Fantasy) have higher resolution textures and higher res textures than native 4K ones but I can't recall any game having the same texture or resolution settings. 
I wonder if the reason for this is different discs being more expensive? They are also more expensive than native 4K discs now and they require more space. 
What is your thought on this? Do you think it will ever happen?
-----
VilleEricson: No, because discs are expensive. 
Yes, it will happen.
-----
Aokiji: It’s possible. It’s just that Japanese games will have to push more expensive hardware.
-----
Knight in Shining Armani: I hope so. 
Sony has never had a console with a screen bigger than 49 inches and they don't use a GPU that much.
-----
Toumari: It may happen.
-----
Hieroph: I think they can do it.
-----
Ichi: It's an interesting proposition.
-----
ShinUltramanJ: Depends on the size of the discs?
-----
Chaserjoey: No, these discs are a lot more resistant to damage from dropped discs and other debris.
-----
Silvergun-Blue: The disc damage problem in Final Fantasy is real.

~!~What is the first game you bought on steam when it launched?

GiantHurtBall: So I got some money in my steam wallet and I decided to finish my backlog first.
I got the following:
A Hat in Time
A Way Out
A Dangerous Driving
A Dangerous Driving 2
All in all, I completed most of these games by about 5 hours.
I didn't get God of War.
It feels amazing to play and unlike Tropical Freeze, I enjoyed the ending even more.
What are your thought process on completing games like this.
-----
TheUnseenTheUniverse: I think it's pretty much a checklist of tasks that I do to completion and it's really great. I feel that Valve could make a really fun and unique game that's infinitely replayable.
-----
CountAntonius: It's awesome to see how many times people have done it.
-----
GiantHurtBall: Just a few. Some of them are easy and some of them are hard. I found most difficult games were the ones that had a lot of collectables.
-----
CountAntonius: I wish I had thought of harder games. I'm far too short on time to do this.
-----
Svart: Exactly these games I was thinking of.
-----
Kraken3dfx: I beat the game in a matter of weeks, I went back to read the book and was pretty blown away after. I have never encountered a game like this.
-----
CountAntonius: Just a few of the games I beat. Some were difficult but hard and some were easy.
-----
HylianSeven: My backlog is the size of my phone, so I mostly stick with short games. I remember picking up a game from a near by seller and just playing around for a while.
On Steam I play older games and most of my Steam library is new releases.
-----
GiantHurtBall: I only really play a handful of games. I only buy a handful of games.

~!~Why are you all playing FFXV right now?

JK-Money: I’m pretty sure fuck all of you are playing it now and maybe not even not even going forward.
I’m liking a lot of the changes it’s making with the new PVP, new story and new areas.
I’m liking the grind and the whole being limited to the amount of times you can lose your Job to pull something from a pile.
I’m liking the game, very fun, but i’m just playing off loading screens.
I’m liking a new cast, seems like a great cast has been brewing and they are basically locked to the main character.
I’m liking the game, with all the new features it’s adding then it looks like everything is working.
Not playable in any way shape or form.
I’m liking a fresh co-op experience with the party at the end of the game.
Now I’m trying to find out what the fuck was making me quit.
-----
Dreamboum: Because it's not like it was a big deal at all. This game is a mess, and that has been a problem for weeks.
It's an FFXV fest and they haven't even announced a release date. It has been a week.
There is no major hype or anticipation. There are very few interviews, videos and previews for the game. There are many outlets who are just repeating the same things.
There are very few interviews, videos and previews. There are many outlets who are just repeating the same things.
Even the main article, which talks about everything from the emotes, to the combat, to the new areas, to the bosses, sounds like a rushed response.
There are many articles, videos and previews for the game, but it is a disaster.

~!~I don’t like how Switch ads are placed on TVs in Brazil

Araujo: Ok, so, shit happens. TVs in Brazil have this crap where they decide to put ads on their TVs in order to prevent piracy. In most countries with big TVs that's all pretty good, but sometimes they will have some crap where the number is literally 25 times higher than that. Here in Spain, it’s even worse. 
I’m from Brazil, and used to watch a lot of commercials from quite a few companies when I was younger. But those commercials, they never left the show and then left again. They usually show the companies running on the same song and played on people. They left the country on the same note they would leave before the game even came out, they just copied it and this time they made it harder to compete. Yeah, I’m pretty sure they made it harder, but the point is that they made it harder. They forced people to pay USD 1000+ for the ad and then they kinda lost interest in games.
Now, I’m not saying that all ads is bad, but it’s hard to make something that can compete with the likes of Nintendo’s Super Mario ads. I think most of them are really, really bad, but I think Nintendo at least tries their best to make it work.
-----
Ada: Ads are annoying on every aspect of hardware, software and services. They suck the life out of the games you already own.
-----
Kouriozan: Ads are the future, they just annoy to play.
-----
Phantom Thief: My issue with them is that they’re annoying me for no real reason other than they’re ads and it’s annoying. I know people outside of the Switch community who hate them, but Nintendo’s ads are just annoying.
-----
MrConbon210: They’re annoying but not really a problem as the advertising on some TVs in Brazil is lower than the UK.
-----
Araujo: Well, there is a reason they keep doing it, it's because they're annoying us. We can all admit that (and I say this way) the Switch is the best platform to play things like Zelda or Mario.
-----
Saint-14: They are ads but this is not acceptable, sorry.

~!~(The) State of Xbox - next-gen console discussion

TheRaidenPT: Since the (almost surely) next gen will be more powerful than the current ones, I thought it would be good to have a thread on where to start the discussion of the state of Xbox consoles.
With each console coming out, what do you think is going to be the hot new place of Xbox and Xbox 360 games? Do you think the power is going to get better and we're going to be able to play Xbox live games as well? Do you think that the power will continue to get better and Xbox 360 games will not be available to everyone, especially in the future?
I personally think the Xbox one is the most powerful.
-----
Klobrille: Definitely Xbox.
-----
Caiusto: Yes, it's got the same power of Xbox 360 games.
-----
Razor Mom: Xbox is the most powerful of all time.
-----
Deleted member 15538: I'm going to echo this, also on a per-console basis.
-----
goonergaz: The next gen will be the most powerful, i just don't know when though.
-----
Klobrille: I am not sure.
-----
Caiusto: Man, you can't come up with an optimal solution with extremely powerful hardware.

Klobrille: Ah, great thanks. Apologies. Thank you.

I have very fond memories of playing Black Ops 4, but I've only played it once and it's not even a replay of another campaign. 
I have a PS4.

- There’s more NPC variation in the level design.
- RNG has been fixed in the original game since launch.
-----
ILikeFeet: inb4 they lock the RNG garbage.
-----
klabautermann: Oh nice! I always knew some of the RNG stuff in the original game had to be done by myself, so I have no excuse to play it now.
-----
KtotheRoc: I'll have to check this game out tonight!
-----
Devilgunman: The original game is soooooooooo good. I like the gameplay, but I can see how this one can be very frustrating. 
The controls feel a bit awkward, but I'm sure it's better than the original.
-----
Sargerus: Is it just me, or does the game look worse than the original?
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: I’m playing through the original so just wondering if it’s still a good game.
-----
Regulus Tera: Yeah, I feel like the game was kinda rushed. I think I'm starting to think it’s actually way worse now, especially with the level design. The levels themselves are still confusing, but the

Bobo Dakes: I'm in the process of purchasing more sets from you guys. I'm a big fan.
But I like the ones I can find as well. I don't know why I like the ones I can't find, but I like a lot of the ones I can find.
I bought the Sets for the ones I've been waiting for and I would like to know which ones you guys like.
-----
SHAQ: I like the ones I have. 
I have a couple of sets that I really like and I don't go to the sets every other day. I bought the Sets for all of them.
-----
Oeufcoque: Scramble, Soul Hackers, All Walls Over Us, and Power Up.
-----
DrArchon: I have a couple of.
I love the one with the backpack and the cinamatic art.
I like the one with the big "tooth" button, though.
I like the one with the hole to the top.
I like the one with the backpack thingy.
I like the one with the spinning gun.
But if you ask me, I like the one I have for the spooky bird, the one with the big "tusk" and the one with the silly bird.
-----
Danthrax: I have all of them. I've been wanting to get all of them and even some of the ones I can't.

Wrapped in Black: I have two.
They're both really nice, and I prefer the one with the spotlight and back tracking better than the one with the traditional key.

I just got the sets for all of them.
I don't know why I have two of them, though.

~!~I am incredibly disappointed by the lack of support for the new Bayonetta 2 on Switch

King of Dreamland: I have been planning on picking up Bayonetta 1 and 2 digitally this week, but I feel like it's been a bit too late to get them digitally. I don't know if the physical release is coming soon, and I feel like I would love to get both, but the lack of physical support for Bayonetta 2 means I just have to wait until after the new game on December 14 to play through the game.
I'm really hoping that the physical version comes out soon in Japan, but it comes with only two moves, and I have no idea when either one will get a physical release, and I just want to know if the physical version will include the unlockable third one.
-----
Sesha: 2 is only 60 bucks, and I don't think I'll get it.
-----
Jaded Alyx: It's in my case and will be shipped on the 24th.
-----
Khanimus: Alright I'm not liking the game. I thought the 2nd stage was fine.
-----
DrakenAstro: I will get them both
-----
MaitreWakou: I'm also surprised they didn't put the two moves as a DLC. They are just serving as two different versions of Bayonetta.
-----
Zephyriel: I'm waiting for the Special Edition. I thought 1 was the definitive version, but the 2nd stage is great, I might get 1 and 2 on PS4.
-----
King of Dreamland: For me, it's not. I didn't get Bayo 2 digitally, but I got Bayo 1 physical and I'm very disappointed in the Switch version. It's a really good game, but the lack of content and trophies is a real letdown.
-----
Lead: I'll be getting it.
-----
MaitreWakou: I've already played Bayonetta 2, it's just an OK action game.

Krejlooc: I'm sure this is about competition, but here's the thing, the word "rent" works for something like a credit card, which is a great deal for the consumer. Arent a credit card? Do you own a PayVR game? Are you able to buy a new VR game for a cheaper price?

~!~[Rumor] Microsoft acquiring Gamepass?

The era of Luigi: Well, i have a few questions:
1) With the current attitude of Sony, Microsoft is better for now. But they tried to create a network services and services that cost $20 a month that would let them to create a better and better services, but they didn't go for it.
2) Microsoft is heavily invested in the Xbox brand and its exclusives, so they aren't interested in the competition. They just want to make their own services.
3) The only reason why they haven't been acquired yet is because of Forza Horizon 3: some insiders tell that Microsoft won't buy Sony again. But if so, what's the reason?
4) Microsoft was purchased by a spyware company, right?
-----
vestan: Microsoft acquiring CC1 isn't a direct rip off of Sony. It's an acknowledgement of how poorly Sony managed to buy out a company with nothing in common? Straight to the junkpot territory.
With Xbox, you can't buy exclusivity for Sony games. Why? Because if you don't like a platform and a marketing deal? Sony have a history of turning the Xbox vs PS4 game-loading service into a multiplatform service with big bloat in the process.

~!~Link's Downgrade in Smash Ultimate is "Disgusting"

Absoludacrous: It's been posted in one of his videos, but it's also a really interesting look at the downgrade.
Link is in a giant power spike in the game, and he's fallen way too far behind other characters. The big power spike for Smash Ultimate is a downgrade, and Link's Downgrade comes from basically no character in a previous trailer. It's kind of like when you take a huge scale and make it look like a cartoon.
I love how he goes from someone that loves the game to this, and a sort of power creep (though not bad, it seems) to this, and then when he finally makes it to the final boss of the final game, it's kind of a power bomb.
I remember when Smash 4 came out, everyone was excited for the final boss of the game after the weird looking heckles of the Stage Visitor. Then, not long after, people started complaining about the boss. "The game looks too similar to Brawl," "Is it just me, or did the Smash Bros. franchise become too much of a power surge?"
It's kind of like when you take a huge scale with power spikes, and then you just blow it out, and just hope that doesn't happen. It's a really interesting commentary on the jump from Melee to Ultimate.
-----
KZXcellent: It's an interesting comment.

Jahranimo: What the fuck Link?

~!~Why are Xbox controllers so light?

Pimienta: Hello, 
I’ve never played a Playstation controller before. I had to play on a Pro Controller. 
I thought I would like a Xbox controller. 
However I’m not sure. 
The controllers are so light I’m having a hard time figure out how to play. 
I do own a PS4 controller. I do have a Switch controller. 
I’ve never used a Xbox controller before. 
Why? 
Because? 
Because why? 
Because? 
Because? 
Because?
-----
GlamFM: It's lighter than PS4, so it's more of a handheld device.
-----
Cartridge Games: Switch is lighter than PS4, Xbox is lighter than PS4, Xbox is handheld
-----
NoMoreTrolls: because it's more convenient
-----
Zippro: Because Xbox is the more "realistic" controller. Switch is lighter than PS4.
-----
Tofer: Xbox is the handheld
PS4 is the handheld
Switch is the portable
For most part, I’m not sure why Sony’s controllers feel more premium to me. I like them better and they seem to be more comfortable overall. 
But that’s just me.
-----
Deku: because they're more comfortable

TheInfinityGauntlet: Because they feel premium

I recently decided to take time to play a lot of Sierra/Mother's Sierra games,even Sierra x Mother's Sierra.
I've been playing some of the old Sierra/Mother's Sierra RPG’s on the Steam,mostly ports. I've been a fan of RPGs on the Lto point ever since DOSBox,like,and,I even remember those Sierra GBA RPGs with the awesome SierraBox RPG and it’s still one of my favourite games ever!
Now,I’ve been thinking about FFVII and its post PS1 remake look.
I remember when I was a kid I used to play this game all the time on my PS1.
I went to the library, looked at a good few RPGs,and then when I got a PS4,I played this RPG again.
I played it again on my PS1 and now it's just a PS4 game,being it’s old times I felt like I was playing a new version of this game instead.
I started it up today and was kinda shocked myself,I knew it was PS1 but was still amazed I could play a PC game like this and not just an older PC game like many other times before.
I now have a PC hooked up and it was my first time playing a PS4 game and I’m amazed I can do this. I’m also doing porting games to PC and I think I’d like to finally try and get a good recommendation on a great game!
So,it’s a Shining Force 4-way game with some fun battles and a story that is basically a time travel adaptation of the classic 1985 visual novel.
If I need any help,I really recommend trying to play the following:
1- Shining the Crystal
2- The rest of Barkley
3- The other games in the Barkley trilogy
And after beating them,I will post the games that I played and also recommend you to play the other games in the trilogy as I always am.
Thanks again!

~!~The best way to play each game in Decopath?

Durden: I've been wanting to replay the old SNES games but haven't had the time to go through them all up to the current version. I've played them all, but I've never played them in order, and I'm not sure if I should go for the SNES or not.
I've read that there are several versions of Final Fantasy Tactics, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to go with the modern version?
I'm sure it's worth $10. Is there a good alternative?
-----
MaximusPayne: This. If you can, play them on SNES. I got about 80 hours into it on the PS1 with my brothers and friend. It's nice to play the older versions.
-----
Lord of Ostia: You will get time to play all the games, but you should only play one version of most of them. The modern versions are usually too long and repetitive to be worth the money.
-----
Dullahan: There's no alternative.
You'll find out when you play the one version.
-----
Dullahan: Yeah, I was afraid it was too short. I had missed about 60 hours.
-----
Dullahan: Oh, it's good to hear. There is no alternative. I couldn't afford a SNES mini when I was younger. I can buy a real one for $25. It's a great deal.
-----
Gitaroo: I think it's worth it. It is the best version of the games but if you want to play older ones get this one.
-----
HosannaExcelsis: There's no other way to experience these games.
If you enjoyed the SNES version then get this. It's good.
-----
No Depth: Don’t miss out on the entire saga.

~!~Is it time for a new 2D Metroid?

Shao Kahn: In the past few years, 2D metroid games have gotten wildly different. In my eyes, being 2D and focusing on the exploration aspect of the game makes it less interesting. So I'm left wondering:
- If it's possible to evolve the 2D metroid design philosophy, should it be greenlit or just made optional for developers?
- What should the next 2D metroid game consist of designing around exploration?
-----
Cybersai: No. As long as the gameplay is good, I'm all for it. I just want good metroid.
-----
Tribal24: No. The world is amazing. The art style is fantastic. I just want more metrodoco.
-----
AuthenticM: I wasn't sure if I needed to say this.
I've been a fan of 2D metroid for years. I have no desire to transition to 2D.
-----
Cybersai: I guess it's possible, but I personally don't like the look of the new metroid so I don't need to see anything else.
-----
Yautja_Warrior: Not in the least, I love the look of the metroid games and I feel like this is the norm.
-----
Yautja_Warrior: I enjoy the metroidvania games but they are very hard to get into and I prefer to watch something else on YouTube
-----
Cybersai: It's not because they're not good games, it's because people don't like metroidvanias. I don't know how you can get invested into a metroidvania game like that. The world, the story, the music...it doesn't matter if you love them or hate them.
-----
MaitreWakou: Yes, it's the best in the series.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: After Metroid Prime 4, I'm expecting 2D metroid to be next game in the series

~!~Are there any other genres worth checking out on the Switch?

SuperNerd3000: I've been getting back into the Switch and it feels good knowing I'm getting stuff I've always wanted even if I don't have a love/hate relationship with. I love Metroidvanias and Mario Strikers but these are both kind of like, I don't know, Gang Beasts. 
I think I'm finally going to give this a try.
-----
Cartridge Games: Switch has a lot of third party games I want to check out but haven’t picked up yet.
Mario Party is basically a must-play if you’re looking for something different. 
This is only if you’re buying a great portable device, that’s pretty hard to do imo.
Is it only Nintendo’s?
-----
ManCityX: I’ve had a good few months of handheld gaming going by the second post.
-----
Mr.Deadshot: I mean, it depends on what you're after, but this is a good explanation.
I definitely enjoyed Super Mario Party as well, but I also didn't really find it to be the best Mario game ever. I wish I could have been in the same situation.
-----
ryushe: I've had a few crashes trying to play Splatoon with friends in handheld mode, but have been able to get pretty far.
-----
BassForever: I mean if you don’t plan to get to grips with the controls you should probably start with the most mario platformer there is and then dive in and maybe see if you like it. I’ve been playing splatoon 2 daily for that difficulty.
-----
boris_feinbrand: Splatoon is the best Mario game there is. You can't go wrong.
-----
Gartooth: You can play this genre without the need of a Nintendo Online subscription.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: Mario Tennis.
-----
Atheerios: Mario Tennis - Tennis budget and time sink.
Mario Maker - no online, requires you to play with friends

~!~SSD4, or slow and not so, Battlefield V: Why is BFV so slow?

Gestault: I'm not even sure I'm ready to call this the “Battlefield 1 of 2018” anymore. The BFV preorder is already going for as much as I would've wanted but BFV has yet to acknowledge that it doesn’t really feature the kind of fast map exploration that all the other BF games do. Even the menus are a mess (especially in V).
However, in terms of UI and general presentation it’s probably the best I've seen a BF game implement, even on console, in a long time. And I have to say, when it comes to the UI, it’s probably the best I’ve seen one implemented.
Everything is fast
BFV’s progression system, while simplistic, is fast. Maps are huge, draggy, and often confusing.
Loading times
BFV does it by allotting a lot more assets for the maps, but as a compromise is that you can only have so many maps at any given time, and there’s actually quite a lot to do at that time/moment in BFV.
Loading times are, overall, really slow. You can’t get a ton of maps if you wait for at least 20-30 loadouts, and loading times become even slower as your progress is wound up by being tied to a time limit.
The mid game is fast
BFV is pretty rigid with the way it handles it. You have loadouts of varying varying sizes, but the biggest one is the one that restricts you to 4 guns at a time.
Loading times are longer in some maps and feel less smooth because you have to jump around or look for cover between vehicles.
The gunplay is more fluid
BFV has a more forgiving gun system than any of its BF games. The longer you play the more aggressive the gunplay is, and it feels more responsive.
The map variety is bigger in some maps
BFV’s maps are often more diverse than BFV’s
-----
Gero: Battlefield V is a massive disappointment and i'm not sure why people think this is any better game.
-----
leng jai: Not even the biggest new IP in the world has a gun combat game in development.

~!~[Open Spoilers] Whack-a-mole in Dead Space

Dusk Golem: So, I've been wanting to make this thread, but the last I've seen of this was the PS3 port, only to be met with a lot of 'OH SNAP THEY DO' posts saying that this was actually nothing more than a fun port.
Many people are disappointed with this game, especially since it's a remake of a crap game. Turns out this was an actual work-in-progress port. Many people pointed out that this actually wasn't as bad as some people speculated, and even some people were critical of this, which is always nice to read even though it's obviously not something I really agree with.
Now, I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but if you have no interest in reading the game that much more important than this thread, go play the Dead Space series.
I'm not going to go into detail, but the game is a remake of a really crap game, and by this I mean the first three but not the second.
I'm going to talk about the one thing I found with all these reviews and comments, and one aspect that is pretty much universally praised about this game, though a few people have made little points of criticism of it, and saying that it's a bad game is just asking for spoilers for a game that is known for its BS.
This game, and the Dead Space franchise, has a reputation and a lot of the critical and fan base base for being bad, mean shitty and insulting. It's reputation and its comments on how shitty it is, and how mean it is to others, to the point where some even claimed the game was a disaster, and even the original creators admitted the reviews were fake, and that the game had a ton of problems.
It's a game that is very much a work-in-progress, and it's a game that has a lot of issues, but it's also a badly made excuse for what it is, and the only reason this game has so much of the same is because it came out very late in the PS2's life, and because the copyright on the game is fucking messed up. So now, I would like to talk about what I consider the worst copyright-infringement I have ever seen:
It has been so long since I have heard of this, and I feel it is very upsetting
====================
~!~What's the best way to play the older games from the SNES/PS1 era?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I've never played any of the SNES or PS1 releases. I know there's a few of them but what's the best way to play them? I mean, I can play the NES releases I've already played but I've not really heard good ones.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Oof.
-----
Richter1887: I bought the SNES classic for the first time a month ago and I am enjoying it but I feel like it has some of the worst sound design and lip syncing issues of the original.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Yeah. I wish I could filter for superior SNES games and ports.
-----
Richter1887: You can play the entire backlog on modern hardware for now.
The backlog is getting smaller by the day.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Well, I am still on the hope this thread gets better sometime next year.
-----
Kapryov: I bought a SNES Classic for myself and my friends.
We never played any of the games you can play.
Each one of them had a bit of a choice to choose from.
My friend had the SNES Classic and we played the first two SNES games.
It was playing the first two Final Fantasy games and a few other indie games.
My friend had the PS1 and the PS2 and played the PS2 game and the first two Final Fantasy games.
Both games we played on the PS1.
Both games we then later played on the PS2.
Both games we later on PS1.
-----
Richter1887: I mean we just played the first FF one and FFVI and then played 15 minutes of FFIV.
Yeah the PS2 games were good.
-----
Richter1887: We played FFIV last week and it is alright but none of them are really good.
-----
Transistor: The SNES games were fine, but none of them were really good.

justiceiro: Guys, before you ask me, what is the best game of 2018 so far? We already have 2 so far, but one of them is really not that great. We have the first one: Dragon Quest IX.
It is a very unique experience and i remember that it is really amazing, while the other one is something else.
So, era, what do you think is the best game of 2018?
-----
Bundy: Hitman 2.
The best Hitman game.
-----
Pog: Super Mario Odyssey
-----
Dio: Witcher 3, but I'm interested in it, and so was Horizon.
-----
Lumination: It's a good game, but it's not for everyone. I had a good time with it, but it's definitely not for everyone.
-----
Platy: best part of the list is how little of a effort it was making it easy to pick up
-----
HououinKyouma00: Persona 5.
There are a lot of great games here, but nothing quite like Persona 5.

Crossing Eden: The project was rebooted a couple years ago...
-----
ASaiyan: I didn't realize that the project had to be rebooted even though most people assumed it was.
Well, that's still unfortunate ... but at least it's not what I expected.
-----
Lant_War: I hope it isn't cancelled for good. Also I love the game but it wasn't like the one with the bad management, they mismanaged the game in a unique way.
-----
ASaiyan: Ah my bad then. Thanks for the reminder.
-----
Crossing Eden: This is the reason why I assume these companies might not care about funding projects that way.
-----
I KILL PXLS: Jameson isn't involved with the game. It's a very small team that's missing a director.
-----
Lant_War: Yeah, he's directly involved. But I guess we'll see what happens when he doesn't clear up everything.

Camjo-Z: Langrisser demo impressions:
Langrisser demo impressions:
Langrisser is a beautiful metroidvania with 2D and retro elements to it. I enjoyed it for what it was and want to see more of it.
Some new information about the demo from the official Langrisser website.
Langrisser, an indie studio who make metroidvania, published by Bandai Namco, has announced a new demo for the Langrisser action game, developed by Nihon Falcom.
The game is expected to be released in Japan in late summer. Bandai Namco have previously released a Langrisser LBC demo for early access early on the dev cycle, which we were able to play testing for quite awhile.
Bandai Namco have previously announced a new Langrisser game for early access, and have also announced a new Castlevania game for early access to the same summer.
-----
yuoke: I played a bit the demo last night and it was pretty good. I like the game.
-----
HylianSeven: Damn, I loved the first one. Bandai-Namco would strike gold with this. A lot of great stuff about the demo. I'm definitely planning to play this.

~!~Do you know of a good "free game" to get when you "choose" to buy a game?

delete12345: I know that the talk sometimes about games with "free" multiplayer component is a lot more about the "free" component than the actual game.
But I want to know if there is a good reason for me to choose a game in that category or not.
I have a few examples of what I know of:
-----
Dancrane212: You can play through Yakuza Kiwami with no extra cost.
-----
fourfourfun: I remember this one. If you like retro/art, you can install the Wipeout N. Sane trilogy demo to your PC and get a taste of it.
-----

Theodran: I'm currently playing through the Yakuza Kiwami demo with the free demo.
-----
Jimnymebob: RGT: Sport is free on the PS Store.
-----
Svart: I wanna know the price of the Yakuza Zero demo before I buy it.
-----

Not sure about this one, but I'll give it a look. Thanks!

~!~I accidentally bought a great game that I didn’t really enjoy

Flecko: My girlfriend sent me a list of 10 really great games that she purchased, but never got to play.
Most of the games were long, boring, shallow and forgettable.
The only one I really enjoyed was The Last Guardian.
He was enjoyable but not very fun to play.
I bought 2 games, one of which was like a mediocre game.
Sly and the Secret of Monkey Island was the first one I played and didn't really like.
Then there’s Monkey Island 3.
Bad game design, bad pacing and everything.
I never got to play it because it was a lot of exploring and screwing up puzzles.
I bought the game few years later and I thought it was pretty awesome.
The game was so fun, yes even though it has a lot of jank.
Problems like this are why I bought more games.
-----
Funyarinpa: The entire first level of the Secret of Monkey Island, taken from a game which I hated.
-----
Flecko: Yep, I played it for hours. Never finished it.
-----
Video Games Are Dumb: The Destiny 2 expansion pack for ps4
-----
Flecko: Just finished the base game, wasn't really feeling the story/characters, but played through it.
-----
Funyarinpa: Yeah, that was a big part of why I hated it. The games just felt kind of dull even if you're invested in the world.
-----
Flecko: Yeah, I think it was because of how dull and uninteresting the story was.
-----
Raijinto: Yakuza's incredibly limited DLC support was the reason why I kept coming back to it.
-----
Flecko: Yeah, I played that for hours on end, finally finished it with Kiwami in January and when it came out I was happy that it was a game I really wanted to play.
-----
Flecko: yakuza was the first game I ever played on ps4, it just wasn't for me at all.

~!~The Best Selling Video Games on Steam

Dusk Golem: I thought this was a topic that was kind of interesting for a ton of folk, and I thought it might be a good place to start a topic. I was discussing the best selling games on Steam in general and this was the first time I really considered it the same way. Here is the list:
I have added a poll to see the best sold games on Steam itself, as well as the most sold games on Steam in general, as well as the sale games on Steam on different platforms.
I'll be doing the same for this topic as well.
I will update the thread as and when I add a poll to the OP and add a Poll so people can make their own informed choices.
-----
meph: One of my favorite threads ever.
-----
SweetVermouth: I only ever lurked Steam for a few days when it was like a few hundred games on steam. I remember being interested on Fifa and Football Manager but when I tried to get into 2K I couldn't play for more than a few weeks and I basically sold my Fifa habit. Then it all went quiet and I wasn't seeing many people playing either.
Edit: I don't own a Steam computer anymore and I'm thinking about giving it a second chance.
-----
SteveWinwood: I remember being really interested in Stardew valley , didn't really care for it back then but I've come a hardway.
-----
MomoVideo: I bought the first game on sale for a looooong time. But I never played it. I always wait till the end of the night and play it. I had a really good time with it.
I bought the second game for like 6 bucks. I was so happy.
-----
Dusk Golem: I made a thread back when I was just looking for games on Steam and started looking at my Steam library again, and I thought it would be a good idea to make a new Thread to track the sales of games on Steam, too. I could always hop on and see if I like it, but I think the community would be a lot more active and active with the community.
To clarify a bit, I'm including all Steam games 'free' with my Steam library, even if you don't 'bundle' all games with 'free' with your subscription funds (Steam doesn't charge for any Steam

Doesn't have a tutorial, but it seems like a good place to start.

Gowans: Yeah it's out now on PS4, Xbox and Steam, you can pre-load the game for us (and us), get our boys when we are available.
I've been meaning to play with him too, he loved Wolfenstein 2 and we're due for a roadtrip game.

~!~I was so immersed in Titanfall 2's MP that I didn't stop to download it

The era of Luigi: I don't know if it was the gamepad alone but I played Titanfall 2 like 5 times and I still haven't finished it
The 1st part of the game was great
The campaign was amazing
The map was great
The game was super fun to play
The campaign felt short
The MP was very boring
The multiplayer was bad
The MP was boring to play
This is my biggest issue with Titanfall 2
-----
Mitsurugi: Yeah it’s very much a titan shooter but it’s not a MP game. I love Titanfall 2 but it’s not for me.
-----
Soulflarz: yeah it's not for me. I get why they choose the name, but it doesn't roll off the tongue for me.
-----
The era of Luigi: It's not for me. I like Titanfall 2 but I know that I NEVER play multiplayer games with a big focus on story.
-----
Mitsurugi: It’s not for me. I like it though, but I don’t like MP games or MP games with a focus on gameplay and the like. I enjoy Titanfall 2 but there’s nothing wrong with being guided either way.
-----
The era of Luigi: I don't know what the word titan means, but there are others words for words that I would like to be read
-----
Soulflarz: no you're right, it's not for me.
-----
Mitsurugi: No, I’m not saying it should automatically roll off the tongue for me. 
I’m more asking if it’s bad or not, not if the word titan is for something you know
-----
The era of Luigi: Yeah I don't know what word titan means.

~!~Is it possible to play a game from a series that is not part of a franchise?

cognizant: Something I've noticed in a lot of genres is that there seems to be a very big gulf between the quality of a game a game is likely to be when it is not from a series.
A lot of games I have seen tried to be like A LOT of games, but from the ones that I know for sure are are 100% real, I've noticed that a lot of games I've seen never even get past the first 10 or so tries, while the quality of the rest is usually quite low.
Why?
Is it just me?
I've always thought that games where the quality of the story is really low, tend to be very mediocre.
I've seen a lot of mediocre games, like stuff like Dead Island, Saints Row 4, and even a couple of RPGs like Tales of Hearts. RPGs like Fallout, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or Elder Scrolls, for example, are generally considered to be among the best in the genre, but I don't know why someone who never played any of these games, who from even a cursory glance seems to think that they are among the best, is continually playing mediocre RPGs.
I've seen a lot of these kinds of criticisms leveled against some of my favorite games. So I'm curious:
Are there any studios or developers that do this consistently?
Has anyone played a game in a series you've always considered to be one of your favorites?
What do you think?

Starlatine: i mean you are asking what a dev would do to make a good game
i felt like the thread title got worse when i saw the title
-----
Zukkoyaki: That seems like an incredibly weird complaint to ask every genre fan
-----
Chivalry: Well, technically "everyone in the thread" is me.

NarohDethan: I've played a lot of RPG's and will always be one of my favorites. 
I've always thought people were crazy over the comparison to "games as a service".

kadotsu: I'm sorry, but you want people to call your game shit?

Aigis: I think the term dev is enough to mean “this is pretty shit”. a lot of people like to refer to games as a

~!~Recommend me some PS4 games for a 2d sprawl

More_Badass: I’m having a really fun time with the PS4 version of Hollow Knight and I’m currently working my way through all the Hollow Knight DLC and I’m just loving the atmosphere and art style. I’ve definitely narrowed it down to three games and just picked up two:
- Into the Breach
- Super Nintendos World
- Super Meat Boy
- The Messenger
- Ikaruga
On my radar list is one of the upcoming games I’m currently working on, however, I’ve forgotten about it because it seems to be really interesting how it can be done and how can it be played today. 
I’m in.
-----
daniel77733: Super Nintendos World. Played it a bit recently on my PS3. Game was gorgeous and the music was really catchy.
-----
More_Badass: I’ll be sure to check it out
-----
Alastor3: I have a big recommend for people who haven’t played Hollow Knight. It’s a really good platformer/turn based game.
-----
DriftingSpirit: If you haven’t played Metroid Prime, Hollow Knight.
-----
More_Badass: Awesome! I’m in, thanks
-----
Slicer Dyster: One of my favorite RPG this generation. Really like this style of game and would love to give it a try.
Im still waiting for more english translated ports, but I'd love to play some of the older stuff.
-----
Aters: I played it as a kid and it was great. I've loved the aesthetics and the music too. Super addicting game.
-----
Mr_Moogle: Not sure if I'll get back into it, but I would play it in VR just to listen to the soundtrack while playing a game.
-----
Waffle: Super Meat Boy. 
There's a demo out there that runs on the PS Store and is worth playing.

~!~Which game did you prefer?

chronic_archaic: I was going to play MK and it had a neat little twist, but having an active competitive fandom made me play it a lot less, I know. I was really disappointed with MK11, which was a decent little game with a cool story, characters, and it had the "fun" of waiting for the right moment to shine light on Subcon's Evil Red.
Now, I'm not a huge fan of games that have so much variety and so little time to commit to them. I was interested in Sonic Heroes because of how the different characters from the different boards were done, but the platforming, the obstacle course, and the character swapping made it feel like a chore to play, and so I didn't really care. I was upset at the removal of the light/dark mechanic in the training mode, and I felt that MK11 had completely eclipsed Sonic Heroes' mechanic.
I did like a few things, though.
1. I could see why it was originally going to have these longer tutorial cuts, but it was intended to be a short game. The training content in particular was great, but they made it work for other boards. Putting the beams on the training area would have made it an instant staple in any fighting game.
2. For me, the music was really the only thing keeping me off of the special stages (since those can be hard, but I can still get into it). The music is the only thing that stands out in the game, but I don't think I'm a huge fan of how the team door works. It's a bit tiring after MK11, and I just don't like how small the rooms are. I'll wait for a sale to go back to the game.
3. The music was great, but the character design was kind of a bummer. I liked the energy bar, but the stage design was really bland.
4. The story overall was pretty decent.
5. The music was a bit "meh", but I enjoyed the characters and stories.
Overall, I loved the game, and would rank it highly. I do wish they would have continued publishing the series, but I know there was a chance to make MK11 this or next year, but I think 2020 is more likely.
-----
SkyMasterson: I think I prefer MK11 more.
I don

Atheerios: Reggie just visited San Andreas. And we are just about to bring the 3DS back.

kami_sama: Reggie is a god.
-----
Zippro: I would tell him to get off of the phone.
-----
Cartridge Games: 3DS is dead.
Don’t see why it would be surprising. It was a good game but it’s hard to sell a 3DS RPG on Switch without having one
-----
KtSlime: Reggie is still one of the best Nintendo characters, best Nintendo president and best Nintendo personage in the world.
-----
Phantom Thief: Dude, that's so awesome. I love Reggie, and I love the 3DS.
-----
Noppie: I hope he would like the 3DS more than the Switch, he's such a great character.
-----
DrArchon: It's crazy to think this is only a year after the Switch's launch.
I mean, the 3DS had a bad generation, and it's not like Nintendo's selling more software on it. I don't see why they would do it.

KtSlime: Please do not make threads about "3DS Remaster or port", or any sort of port discussion.

~!~The top 10 most played games on each platform for the first time since inception [GPD Win]

Bruno MB: The goal of this thread is to use the smallest and overall most popular games on each console to trace the statistics of the platform's first 10 registered users for the time it was active during the time it was active on those platforms. By 'top 10' there are lists of games which are active on all platforms. The greater part of these lists is likely from prior gPDWin data we have no idea about, namely because of which platforms it was first used outside of the MAME 1000 or GAF but then there are lists which are likely purely from prior gPDWin data found over a decade ago.
I have marked the games with a greyed out grey mark and the lists marked with a greyed out grey. Please note that the complete list can be skipped if you want to access it from your browser.
Note: The complete list can be skipped, but the trace stats are there if you want to check your history while playing a game.
Note: The complete list can be skipped, but the following the gPDWin data we have no idea about is likely to be likely to skew the data skew as we do not have prior data collected for any of the games.
For the sake of having a separate list of all games for each MP/PC, we counted both single and multiplayer PC games. Multiplatform games were defined as those using both simultaneous ownership and simultaneous capab
-----
atomsk: I wonder how many games are still on steam? I know there's a lot of old PC games, but the sheer amount of games on there combined with the simplicity of the MP games, is a good indication that lots of games are still available
-----
Sophia: Wasn't there a rumor that Divinity and Warhammer were being ported to consoles? If so, that's a pretty good indication that that was more than just porting one.
-----
Admiral Woofington: I'm not sure. I think it's just a few games that are absent from steam atm.

~!~Did you know that Splatoon 2's monthly update also includes a free trial of the online play?

delete12345: The December update is the first time since the November update that added online play (or "updates"). For those interested, the December update brings back a new free-for-all multiplayer feature.
The free-online feature was added to OctoExpansion 1.
I wonder if Nintendo is preparing to offer one for Splatoon 2's new update so that players would also be able to try out the new online play.
-----
Neoxon: Oh yeah, I forgot about this feature. Hopefully they add it for Splatoon 2's.
-----
Phantom Thief: Honestly, no.
-----
Satonaka: Yeah. Not even joking.
-----
delete12345: I'd agree if I did, but it really would be more "so you can play the online games for free" than "I'm going to try the Splatoon 2 updates".
-----
Neoxon: It's not just about the number of Salmon-type enemies, it's about how the update works. With more than 500,000 unique players every month, it wouldn't be surprising if they offer a free update next month.
-----
delete12345: In the August Splatfest Matches, you can watch all 12 fighters from the Salmon (and Bison) variants you will play against.
-----
Cartridge Games: I don’t think they’d be able to add it, tho.
AFAIK, they’re just offering a free update next month, not like this.

~!~Let's talk about the best/least ambitious game in the last decade

The era of Luigi: I just remembered that i played this game on Gamecube and 360 and never got around to it.
However, the one thing that intrigued me was the idea of a story based game. Something as simple as a story with branching paths and some choices but also choices that involved other characters and important stuff. Something that the other games in the genre were also trying to do but are not as complex (and I believe besides being a little bit more complex, the choices really can have more weight behind them instead of just being some random random story branching).
Well, let's talk about those
(sorry, i can't post the link right now)
Mass Effect was another one. What we have in this game is that you are a protagonist, you have choices and you also have a role to play. You can help a group of different people or even just kill bad aliens. I remember Mass Effect 2 was similar but the story was not as good. I thought the game was very ambitious and it would have been better if it was about the hero, saving the day, or other crazy story related activities.
The game also had a lot of mandatory fail-states. It was hard to enjoy the game if you miss a major fail-state and the game instead made you die more in the end. It was a shame because it was really good!
What are your thoughts on the suggestions from ERA that inspired this thread? I love RPGs. I love the Mass Effect Universe of games. I love Mass Effect. I love Dragon Age games. I love Final Fantasy games. I love other RPGs. I even love the whole Borderlands series. I just love RPGs so I really appreciate that. I just don't love the game as much as the others.
-----
Jawmuncher: The best RPG of the last decade(and a whole trifecta of RPGs that released before it).
-----
DarkChronic: I really enjoyed the game but it was a very short game and I didn't really enjoy the "games" portion of it. It was definitely worth the time and money if you could get into the series though.
-----
Zhukov: I liked it quite a bit. It's like Prince of Persia crossed with Prince of Persia.
As stated above, the protagonist is a protagonist and you can choose your character

~!~Stories of games you played that you thought you knew you wanted more of?

Masterspeed: With video games already pushing the medium to its limits what kind of stories are you taking seriously if you want to play a game you've always wanted to play but don't know anyone else is having a talk with you about?
In this thread im talking about the stories of games you've played that you've enjoyed you're playing, from a story perspective, that's why you should play them.
I'm talking about games you have heard OP tell you about games you want more of, that you can enjoy you're playing.
I'm talking about games that are good, but are just not available digitally or on modern platforms.
I'm talking about games that are say have decent reviews or are very good about gameplay and are well designed with a good story behind them.
I'm talking about games you love, but would you like to play them?
I'll start with an example, I love Final Fantasy XV.
I haven't played any of the FF games so I can't answer your question about story or gameplay differences.
-I have no real knowledge of how the story plays in the real time with my first play through
-The game is short, 15 hours, ok overall but I don't think it's worth it
-I have never played a Final Fantasy game before
-I love the story, I love the characters, the music, the gameplay. I love the world and the characters, I love the characters' designs, and I love the nature of the story.
-I love the combat system
-The game is seriously fast paced, maybe I'll play the 20h first, but I'm not sure if I'll like it fast enough
-I've never played a Dragon Quest game
-I've never played a Dragon Warrior game
-I know about the high school ball fuse thing, but I don't remember it
-I have never played a Shantae one
-I know about the Shitty List
-I know about the gold stars thing, but I don't remember it
-I know about the Fumasuda triangle
-I've played a lot of jrpgs
-I know the black magic stuff, but I don't remember it
-I know about the Fumasuda weird stuff
-I've never played a Pokemon game

~!~The Crew 2, or how Ubisoft is giving us a damn racing fix.

v_iHuGi: I can't watch video right now, but in the game's launch window, Ubisoft postponed yet another livestream about The Crew 2 until the game's release, delaying a second livestream prior to the game's release that finished June 9th.
Now, it seems that The Crew 2 is getting a second livestream today, June 10th.
And for those who don't know what The Crew 2 is, it's a racing game that Ubisoft usually promotes VERY often, but during this time, they also released a new patch that fixes a lot of repeated problems in many of its maps, adding new art, a new driving mode and perhaps even a new chapter of the story.
Here's a preview video from the livestream:
And here's some concept art from the livestream:
Also worth noting, The Crew 2 was not added to Ubisoft Club, but its currently free for everyone.
So, do you agree that The Crew 2, or how Ubisoft treated it, that you felt wasn't ready?
-----
TheMoon: While The Crew 2 had already been released for PC, it was delayed and delayed sooooo much that it lost its own visibility and lost most of its casual audience.
-----
v_iHuGi: I only played the first one, I don't agree with you that its too much like a 2 year development cycle.
-----
Slam Tilt: I'm not a racing fan at all, but I've been wanting to see what this game is like when it's out.
-----
TheBaldwin: The game was revealed way before release, and thats one of the main reasons i havent played it, racing isnt that fun to me.
-----
JaseC: Yeah, I'm not a fan at all of the way it's been treated this entire time. It's also a big, long, long wait for updates. The game was released in July to the shock that it's releasing in just under two months, and now it's at almost the same price as AC Odyssey.
But, yeah, The Crew series has lost its appeal, from casual fan to professional experience.

Starlatine: I mean, it's not a racing game in and of itself (its a strategy/crafting game)
You can get it on all platforms, with

~!~What is your favorite horror game that has not been remastered yet?

SolVanderlyn: I love horror games. I have over 35 (mainly with modern bells and whistles) horror games in my life. My favorite is Clock Tower, where I met the protagonist, and we started with the REmake trilogy.
Resident Evil 2 was the first time I had ever experienced a game with a truly horror level, and it was the first time I had played horror games, and it was the first game that I truly appreciated. Clock Tower was great, and I thought it'd be cool to play another one.
Resident Evil 3 and 4 came out in the late 90's, and they're both still the best and most terrifying games I've played. REmake 3 is a close second, but both of those games were just as mind boggling in the early 2000's. Resident Evil 4 was let down, as it's main mechanic is just that — figure it out.
I loved RE4, but it's not a horror game, so it's not a horror game.
Resident Evil Remake has also been remastered, for what, 20 years now?
I'm not even an REguy.
So, my question is — what is your favorite horror game? Why do you think it's my favorite, and why do you think it's the most boring to play that hasn't been replayed in years?
-----
Kromeo: I like the ones that are fully realised and the ones that have fixed camera perspectives
-----
Servbot24: REmake, especially the first game.
-----
jacks81x: REmake.
-----
CannonFodder52: REmake

Mauricio_Magus: REmake

SolVanderlyn: I've been replaying the original REmake recently, but I'm not sure how badly that turned out so well.

~!~RTTP: Xenoblade Chronicles X, or how I nearly fell over with my JRPG

Dreamboum: The other day, I played a long-lost game that I nearly fell over with. I played it for a long time but never played it again. It was at a party of me that we played it for a while and we both barely got beyond Sodom. I gave up after that. It was a good game, I thought, but just about the time I got it, I started to get cravings for more. I realized I really needed a change.
Twenty years ago today, the Xenoblade Chronicles first released in Japan. People consider JRPGs to be one of the greatest forms of entertainment, but the game was a clear and clear attempt to tonerify the experience. It was a JRPG first, a JRPG second. The story was simple and clean. It didn't need to be, simply because the world building, the setting and the gameplay were so engaging. The story told here was far beyond what any JRPG other than Final Fantasy. It was about adventure and discovery, and it was about finding the meaning inside yourself.
Xenoblade Chronicles 2, on the other hand, came at a time when I felt my taste for JRPGs had returned. It was a remake of a game that I had played back in the 90's and had long since forgotten its roots. Unfortunately, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is the game that has reignited my interest in gaming, and the first time I have truly experienced what I consider to be one of the greatest games ever made.
Now, I am 30 years old, and I have played almost all the big consoles. I have always been fascinated in JRPGs, specially JRPGs in general, like its visual novel, and the atmosphere of this game blows me for a JRPG. It has a "high fantasy" vibe, with steampunk and mechas thrown in, with a emphasis on isolation and fear. The game was a remake of a game that I had previously played way back in 2006, and it was a game I had been interested in playing for a very long time before I even considered buying a Switch.
And I am glad I finally did, and I think a lot of people here are too. The game is so pure a pure JRPG experience, and so much fun.
I have a lot of fond

Crazy Izanagi: I’m trying to decide what games to play for the PS3 retro console but I’m always stuck at one point and want to know what’s the best way of researching this.
I’m a bit clueless on what’s best to go about playing and know what platform to get it on.
I’m not very good at strategy games or turn based games and wondering what’s the best way to do play these games? I’ve played the first game on the SNES and I’m wondering what’s the best way to start.
I’m looking for it a lot online especially now with the internet becoming more widespread.
-----
Velocity:Design:Comfort: Are you looking for strategy or fun games? Stick to the former.

As for your post, King of the Monsters 2 is also a pretty bad TPS, but at least in its own right.

Zacmortar: That's some good content man
I wish I didn't have to look up every misstep Soul Calibur and Tekken and whatnot to make a video about them. They should be a part of the SoulCalibur franchise as well. It's a shame that the only legitimate excuse for bad content is justification for the online service.

~!~Annoyances and glitches in Dark Souls Prepare to Die game?

Mondy: So I was messing around with Prepare to Die and trying to decide how to play. I know it's a very hardcore souls-like, but let's just pretend everything doesn't works and walk through the hazard menu and see what happens.
I'm playing on PS4 Pro at the highest settings, it's 1920x1080 and it has an G-Sync monitor. I'm just curious as to what anybody else has experience with this?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It doesn't work for you and the game is designed for you, it's just a load of WILD ARES
-----
Carn: It doesn't work for you and the game is designed for you, it's designed for you
-----
Keldroc: It doesn't work for you.
-----
Kenzodielocke: There are load-ins, at least I remember one.
-----
OrbitalBeard: There are load-ins, yes. There are load-ins, no.
-----
Mondy: You can turn them off and go back to the normal game.
-----
Keldroc: I'll turn them off and leave them on. If I hit a guide button on the PS4, it will autodetect the guide.
-----
Rean: it doesn't work for you, the game is designed for you

Mondy: Not really, there's a load and a lot of things can screw you over if you don't follow them.

~!~Should I play Bloodborne before Sekiro?

asmith906: So I've been playing a lot of Bloodborne and Sekiro. I'm wondering what you guys thoughts on it are. Do you think Sekiro is worth playing?
-----
Interficium: Nope.
-----
Gbraga: No.
-----
JaegerLead: I'd probably be playing Sekiro, but I'm not sure I would want to, given I'm gonna have to get through Bloodborne first.
-----
Jawmuncher: I think Bloodborne is the better game by far, both are well done.
-----
asmith906: Good advice. I mean you can't go wrong with Sekiro.
-----
Iceternal: I think it's a bad game
-----
Ratchetdude231: No. There's no real reason to.
-----
Jaeger-Altered: No. The game is a BR game, not a Souls/Borneo/Skyrim type game.
-----
Kuro: I think you should play the first, esp. the second one. Simple and repetitive.

oni-link: I'll be taking a quick list of games I've played this year in order of completion:
Red Dead Redemption 2
Mario Kart 8
Fallout 76
Dark Souls Remastered
Firewatch
Ashen
The rest I'll probably give up and focus more on playing more Smash. Otherwise, it's a really good time.
What is the best game you have tried this year?
Mine is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
I can get over almost anything, but this one was the first game I played in a month, and I believe I've over tripled that this year, so far as I can remember.
-----
Pikachu: GTA 5

Cess007: Divinity 2: Original Sin
Havent played it and have only put in 4 hours so far, but I think I will

jacks81x: Ninja Gaiden 2. 
I can finally finish 2 and a half campaigns.

Spinluck: A lot of those are game specific difficulty spikes, but the three I've played this year are:
1. Overwatch

3. Kingdom Hearts series

~!~Is it me or is the Switch's inability to automatically update itself a bad state?

Nuclear Muffin: I've been seeing threads pop up for a while now titled "The Switch is prone to being an idiot" and it got me thinking...
Is it me or is the Switch somehow inherently prone to getting indecisive when in a game I enjoy?
It turns out that it is! The newer the Switch is, the less likely I am to start a game and the easier it is for me to get stuck somewhere I won't want to. Nintendo doesn't have that problem with their newer consoles!
So to start things off, the most common reason I can't play Metroid Prime is that I've considered it broken and unplayable but now I've decided I'm not interested. If I end up going back to it, I'll regret my decision.
I tried playing the demo of Rayman Legends on the Switch and I was consistently unable to complete the level and then I tried to go back and finish it, I even thought I was unable to see the next arrow leading to it but no! I couldn't!
The reason I can't enjoy an action game is because of this! I feel like I'm missing something when I switch from a handheld to a 4k screen. The Switch is only capable of getting 4k visuals when it has a handheld mode option. Even a small game like Dragon Quest XI can't look native, 720p or 1080p.
I've tried playing World of Final Fantasy and I was unable to complete the level and then tried to go back and play it, I even had my mind blown when I read the lines again! It's like those words were written by a child who had to struggle with ADDism and borderline distress and were unable to understand what the hell is going on.
I've tried playing Pokemon and I was unable to complete the Pokemon stage! I've even tried playing a few of the random encounter Pokemon races in Smash, I couldn't even do one of them!
So is there any possibility whatsoever that the reason the Switch is prone to getting these issues is because of some aging in the population? I want to play Pokemon but I need to get through a game before I can afford to do so!
I know that Nintendo doesn't have a problem with this and I'm sure that I'm ignorant, but this is the first time in over a decade where I

~!~What is your favorite game you played this generation?

VanCityGamer: Inspired by the "Favourite game of this gen" thread from over a week ago, I decided to count the days since the game came out. And by the numbers, it's become my favourite game of this generation. 
I've played the games in the GOTY voting since release, and I generally consider them the best games of the gen. And I feel that, due to my preferences, I can't think of a single one that I've not had within the last few years. 
But I'm so drawn to games that I've played that I can't help but feel a special something special about them. 
So, what is your favorite game you've probably not played this generation? And why?
-----
LonestarZues: Not a lot of those gotYs. But I've never had a backlog like yours.
-----
HououinKyouma00: God of War
-----
Syrons: Red Dead Redemption 2, totally.
-----
SOLDIER: Probably the first game I’ve played for at least two months before it shutting down.
This game is so amazing and I have no idea what I’d be doing with all the hours I’ve put into it.
-----
DanteLinkX: I think the best one imo is Witcher 3 imo. Witcher 3 was the first one I ever finished.
-----
Gbraga: This is the one I've been playing more this gen.
-----
TheBeardedOne: Definitely. I've been meaning to get back to it, but I've only got around to beating every side quest in the game. It's been a while but I've managed to beat The Bearded Ladies and Blood of the Naxxonia.

FaintDeftone: Only beaten the second one and she's not even close to done so...

~!~LTTP: Resident Evil 7 Biohazard

CharlesAznable: So I just wrapped up my playthrough of RE7 and now I'm just on the second scenario of playing Resident Evil 7. I like it, it's one of those games where it really is, really well made. The gameplay is fast, fun and the story is really good. I know some people hate this game, but I've never seen a person hate it so much in all my years playing the game. 
I'm really glad I've finally gotten the hang of it. The control scheme was really nice, the pacing was really good and the bosses were really good. I found myself really liking Sebastian and Lant_War. 
The only thing that a lot of people don't like is the lack of a satisfying final boss. Not like there was a shortage of bad bosses in the game, but the ones that were not satisfying were the ones that didn't really matter for me. 
I think the main problem was the design of the mansion. It's kind of a bore to look at if you don't mind looking at your enemies. The way Sebastian's design is so dull, it's a shame because the game could've gone a step further by having him be the main boss enemy and just having a few variations of the final boss. The only satisfying thing comes from having a boss that you're not supposed to fight because the way they're designed made it really hard to fight. It's kind of lame too, but I liked it. 
The best boss battles are the ones that are hard, but still not too hard. The boss that can be killed, but you have to use your health meter. If you're not dying at all the first time, you can just run past them until they're dead. Of course, it's interesting to see the final boss’s health and if he had health regen too, you can choose to fight “as” his boss, whereas other bosses don’t. There’s no sprint, no reach, no attack, no escape, no use move sleep, no et cetera. The final boss has to be fought in order to finish off the player. 
It is so satisfying to finally master the game’s strong design.

~!~Sony Santa Monica hiring spree seemingly started by PS Blog (Ori and the Will of the Wisps?)

Nirolak: As we get into the Christmas season, I thought it would be nice if Twitter had a thread on this new hiring spree, and if you thought it was threadworthy, you can submit a tweet here.
Source:
-----
patapon: Hmmm...
-----
Memento: "We have no idea about future projects"
"We are not related to Santa Monica Studios anymore"
"They are working on another game"
-----
Memento: "Yes"
-----
Wollan: Not really surprising if you consider the studio as a whole.
-----
patapon: In the end it seems like Sony Santa Monica (Sony Santa Monica) just made the biggest comeback post-grattier.
-----
Sillution: "I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm starting to see the movie's success."
-----
Jarod McChicken: That tweet is kinda misleading, he probably applied it at the end of the year and began working on it again after that. It's a 2019 game now, he just started writing it.
-----
Nirolak: I think he specifically said that in a Santa Monica tweet, but the current rumors are that they're going to do a new game from the ground up.

Valdega: That tweet is the proper title.

~!~Switch owners, is it worth it to buy a physical copy of Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga DX for the Switch or is it better to get the DX for the Switch

Hero of Legend: I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are on this. I know, I'm one of those weirdos who tries to get into stuff like this and there's been a few threads about it, but I was really surprised to find that Switch owners were kind enough to suggest that they might be willing to buy the physical version for the Switch.
Of course, you don't have to give up your 3DS, Vita, or PSVita copy as well. But if they don't feature the 3DS line, maybe it's worth it to buy an extra physical copy for the Switch. It's like they don't give a fuck if the Switch version is better or cheaper. And if they've gone out of their way to include the 3DS version, maybe they will at some point.
-----
Khanimus: I believe physical copies have a max savings of up to $100.
-----
TheMoon: you can't even miss it. if you can't wait, go for it. inb4 or on launch.
-----
MrCafecito: I believe you can only buy it for the game, not the game itself. They arent special editions.
-----
Raster: It's waaay cheaper than getting the DS port also
-----
Khanimus: I didn't even know they had the carts!
-----
Laserbeam: I'm inclined to say go for it.
-----
Mediking: Buy it.
It will only serve to grow your hype when it comes out.
-----
Zalman: Buy it. If you think there's a need, go for it.
-----
Herb Alpert: I don't think it's worth buying for the game even for the second half of the game. 
If you like the game, go for it.

~!~Future of Gold is Coming Soon to the Epic Games Store

vivftp: It's been discussed a lot in the Epic Games Store Forums and Reddit. However, I thought this article was worth pointing out as there seems to be some confusion over what the future of Gold is.
It's a feature originally designed by the developers that made Gold what it is and it could be seen as a negative. Being able to sell your Games and Games Gravity content on the Epic Games Store. Having the Epic Games Store make purchases using your Gold reserves at a higher price point than Steam. It's seen as a positive by some. However, some people feel that Epic is hindering development of the future of Gold by locking you in a inferior store where you can't be even started.
-----
Cartridge Games: I guess they think its just as bad as steam for 2$?
-----
GTAce: It's the same as steam. Only reason I still use Steam is for the convenient store experience.
-----
pazinyo: I mean it's a great feature and I think it should be in.
I would have preferred the steam store experience with MTs.
-----
TheMoon: This thread will eventually lead to the complete destruction of my current account.
-----
The-Depth-In-Us: I think its a good feature.
If they don't integrate it into Epic Games Store I will not be happy.
-----
LordAmused: It's a great feature. I think it's a good deal more than the other storefronts.
-----
Alblowi: I'm amazed it even exists.
-----
KoolAid: It's not a terrible feature, just a disappointment in the current incarnation of the store. The Epic Launcher has long existed and it's clear they are moving on from it.
-----
The-Depth-In-Us: That's a good point. While the feature is not perfect, it is what it is and I don't see why Valve should be actively work to improve that experience in other storefronts.

Kyoufu: check out the old software hiragana/soulsplay guides because that's what they recommend
-----
DGenerator: It's a huge, expensive undertaking and a huge dark period for classic LucasArts games.
-----
asmith906: Damn. I read that on here. I really want to play the originals.

Xagarath: If you're already a fan of the classics, then the first one might be a good start. I haven't played the second, not sure about the first one.

Masterspeed: I'd say check out the classics first. You can't go wrong with the first one.

asmith906: I've heard good things about the classics. I'd probably just play the first one

The game was released in 2005 and had a very different reception than the first game. It was the first videogame with a story to really grab you, and the game gained a lot of attention from the west.

Heartskips: Kintaro is a real treasure.

Dekim: If it did not exist then Sony wouldn't care.

tyfon: Well, it's not like they have much to lose in terms of hardware if they're going to be pushing it day and day over and over again.
But, I don't think Sony knows that.
It's hard to say what they're even considering when they say it's inevitable.

N.Domixis: I think it’s possible. They’ll have to offer a 1000m dollar model for the PS5.
-----
Richter1887: I hope it will come here day 1.
-----
Tofer: I think they’ll be pushing a big enough revision that people who don’t want to upgrade will wait. I think they’ll be able to offer a Pro or X version
-----
chandoog: I don't think they will be able to offer a higher end model upgrade, they will be able to offer a mid gen upgrade that will offer the mid gen refreshes in a much more powerful console.

TheRaidenPT: I think they'll be able to offer a mid gen refresh that will improve the system significantly.

~!~Are you accepting a new Monster Hunter for World mode?

Flevance: I'm just curious, I've only played a bit of the main game and I'm still unsure on what I like/should play from the main game.
I've been pretty open to a new Monster Hunter since the announcement of MHW. I just wonder if I should just accept that I've been burned out on the Monster Hunter formula or if I should go back to the more familiar series and do some hardcore World of Warcraft/Heroes style and maybe grind through some bosses on my own.
I just feel like I'm missing something new for World, maybe a little more or less pure gameplay.
And I mean I still haven't played through the DLC. I know it's grindy and there's a few other things I'm unsure about but I know I'll enjoy it just as much as the base game. 
I'm especially interested in how the new features/changes will improve the PvE mode. 
Anyways I'm thinking I'll just stick with World and go back to my retries where I can.
-----
Theswweet: I have no idea what I'm looking for, but if you like World, maybe just play the base game.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I'm playing a different game and I'm liking it more than I thought I would.

Cantaim: The new stuff in World is cool, but I haven't tried any of the dlcs yet.

Skel1ingt0n: I thought it would be a good idea to make this thread, as I know Rachet fans exist on the internet and I have a history of them.
Rachet is a racing franchise developed by Rangite Entertainment. I have followed it since it was released on Gamecube in 2005, played through the original version of the game on my PSP (plus the sequel on Steam), and played through the remaster on my 3DS.
I know the developer is in a legal mess, and this thread is going to involve me going through the whole business of a developer in order to report any rumors of them happening.
I would like to see people who have the same experience as I have.
-----
Zippo: I don't think there's a way to report a rumor, but if someone can leak that info about a game, that's cool.

Mauricio_Magus: I've been following them for over 10 years.

~!~Why didn’t the rising costs of living help increase labor costs?

delete12345: Google Trends the rise of Unreal Engine 4, found that the number of workers in the US and Europe are constantly growing, thanks to the introduction of paid tech in the last few years.
When Google first unveiled the "My Google" service on Android and iOS, it got a lot of criticism for having a huge Labor Department, and for being a US-only brand. However, it also revealed that workers are more willing to pay for the same services as other workers, and that labor costs are only beginning to climb.
Google has recently launched a service called Project Stream, which allows you to stream games in the Google Play Store, and it also includes a paid tech demo. Last year, Google also added a streaming version of Project Stream to Chrome, and Google plans to launch a new version of Project Project Stream in the coming months.
Google has also recently launched a service called Project Stream Pro, which allows you to use your Google phone or your Google Project ID to remote play your downloaded YouTube app. The Pro is pretty different from the old model of Project Stream where it provides unlimited data caps and no way to manage internet connection. Now Google also launched a Project Stream trial that gives you unlimited data usage on your smartphone and your Google Project ID to remote play your downloaded YouTube app. The Project stream is also available in selected countries in Asia.
I don’t understand why is this the case. The fact that Google is expanding its cloud gaming services, is even more clear.
Why wasn’t the labor and capital requirements for these services raised to the same level as the US and Europe? Or is this an issue of workers, not Google? The only reason I can think of is to compete directly against Sony and Microsoft.
-----
Shark: I mean it makes sense for Google to want to compete on a large scale, but the reality is that they are very, very small.
-----
Cartridge Games: At least in the US, they’ve offered services for a long time, like Netflix.
It’s probably a good thing that streaming is finally beginning to push Google into that streaming space, especially since they’re promising Gaikai and Project Stream and that’s just the start.

~!~Anno 1800: New update released, new Settlers and New Map available

jariw: Link
Anno 1800 was one of my favorite games of 2017, one of the best games of the year and one of the best-Engagement-driven add-ons to the Steam Workshop. Anno 1800 was released a few weeks ago and has been in Early Access for a long time now, but it seems that an early access version is live with new Settlers expansion soon.
The update is called 'Anno 1800: Off The Record' which originally was just a quick update patch to reskin the Anno 1800 update, this time patching the older content that had been missing and trying to fix some of the issues with the original game.
The official changelog for Anno 1800 shows off some of the new features the modding community has already found, such as the option to choose between two primary protagonist (the first is Black) and the option to choose between two custom protagonist, the following options can now be selected:
Black Player - The default protagonist. 
Black Title - The title of the base unit. 
Black Title Background - The background of the unit background. 
In order to properly display the title background, the following options can be selected:
Note that the following unit will always be available at the start of each faction

More_Badass: A few points about the game and some nitpicks
I really like the game even if it has some of the drawbacks of having a traditional walking/running story. The audio design feels really good and the level design feels good to navigate, just not perfect.
One nitpick I have is that the perspective for most of the game is locked to a room. If you peek around you may not even notice the audio cues that are important to the story. It's just a weird way to tie it all together.

Meelow: That's fine. I hope they are coming.

Atheerios: I want the old ones to stay, but I want the new ones to stay.

mindsale: Old ones, no. 
Monster Hunter: World would be a better game without those gimmicky bumpers.

Dyle: I want at least one new monster per year. Each year they should let us fix the returning ones like we did with every new game

Cybersai: Yeah, I'm open to flesh and bones again.

~!~I Love Pokemon HeartGold/SoulSilver, but the game is not "fun" at all

BillFromAccounting: I love the game, and I think it's one of the best in the series. I also don't think you can play without taking your time, but I think it's just as enjoyable if you don't.
I know it's like a handheld game. But I just wish the game had a lot more of the Pokemon's moveset. I mean Heart Gold and Soul Silver has about as much of them as the 3DS games.
-----
Mirev: I actually really like it. I only played 2-4hrs on the original Gameboy and never got lost in the Hoenn region, so I'm pretty sure I'm getting to choose this one of the best games of all time
-----
Spring-Loaded: I don't play enough co-op games to say I love it more than the others
-----
Winterreise: The game is also quite fun, if a bit more forgiving on your first playthrough. It's not very long, it's a lot of Pokemon and the adventure modes change up depending on what route you take. It's worth playing through if you're just itching to experience world-building and good things, but if you're just itching to learn and play with a group of random Pokemon, it's a fine game to.
-----
Mediking: I also love the new Pokemon designs. HeartGold and SoulSilver have my favorite designs of the Pokemon.
I like the game but I can't stand the stupid red/blue and yellow stuff.
-----
WrenchNinja: It's a great game and a great gateway for the series.
-----
Zacmortar: The gameplay is fun, but the postgame is really slow and repetitive
-----
doodlewhizz: It's a great game, don't get me wrong, I love the starters, GSC having a gimmick only makes it better, but its slow nature makes it a bit tedious.
-----
WrenchNinja: I find it a bit annoying that it's pre-sequel stuff where there are literally dozens of post-process knowledge-offs to learn about that requires you take a break between sessions of co-op.
-----
Zacmortar: I think the best Pokemon games were the ones that were actually fun but the post game got boring

CannonFodder52: The Resident Evil series is known for its fantastic sequels. From 2001-2006, the franchise has seen almost all the spin-offs and the series' greatest work – RE2 and RE3 Remake.
What if Resident Evil got a good sequel in the form of RE2R?
Personally, I'd say it's a given. RE3 is one of my favorite games of all time and I'd say that series' genius even shines through. If RE2 does end up being a good sequel, I'd say it's in great hands.
What would you want out of the franchise?
-----
StuBurns: It's not a good RE series. It's not good enough.
-----
Phendrift: It’s practically a Frankenstein.
It’s a horror game with a terrible antagonist in Leon, and you have to kill him off for the rest of the game, and then be playing as a girl.
It’s not a good Resident Evil series either.
-----
Weiss: The series got the worst remake of any horror franchise since The Evil Within.
-----
HStallion: The Baker house is the best starting town and everything you go there is a scary ghost hunting experience. The game has some great stuff but the series has been so bad it's been almost forgotten.
-----
Arta: RE2 was the least memorable. Other than that I wouldn't even care.
-----
Phantom Thief: I would focus on RE3 as an antidote to RE2 having problems.
-----
HStallion: I'd rather they start from scratch with the formula that they've been putting out since REmake.
-----
Chivalry: RE3.
-----
Stalker: If they could give me the RE4 remake as a starting point, I would be satisfied.

~!~Bungie Project Halops Drops $1 Million Game Revenue Today

Stoopkid: 
-----
Papaya: Very curious about how well it will do. I still consider Destiny's expansion to be a success, but I'm not sure if it's a big enough push for them to only focus on the game 1 year after launch.
-----
Klobrille: Very cool.
-----

Smurf: wow
-----
CloseTalker: This is great news, and a sign that things are about to REALLY open up. The game I once thought I would never play will be one hell of a lot more interesting than the one I played on my own PC.
-----
Anoregon: What's the gameplay reveal?
-----
Shao Kahn: That Destiny-like multiplayer has been making the rounds on social media today.
-----
CloseTalker: Yeah, I just saw that, seems pretty good to me. I'm still upset about it being Taken.

====================
~!~LTTP: Skyrim (NES)

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I played this game on my SNES. I honestly don't remember this game being fun, but I remember it being the opposite. It was so much more creative and fun. I remember the setting and atmosphere were just so much fun. I remember going to a city with the mayor and just roaming around and talking to a ton of people. The writing was just so good too. I also remember going to a town with the gang and just wandering around and talking to folks. I think I remember just getting really addicted to this one. I thought it would be really cool to finish something this bad with some improvements that don't have a ton of substance.
It's not my favorite game in the series, but I did love it. I'm actually playing it again right now. It's Skyrim, but Skyrim is by far the better of the two. I knew this was going to be another type of game at first but man I was blown away. I actually had no idea this game was this good back then and am still playing it at this point. I've never been so blown away in my gaming life as I was when I first played this.
The Minish Cap was the icing on the cake. The writing was some of the best I've ever seen in a game. This section of the game, though? I feel like that's what this game needed to sell itself on. The sequel to Skyrim needs to be the better game.
So yeah, I think I'm addicted to this game. It's not even the most fun game I've ever played, but it is a lot of fun.
-----
Barrylocke: Yep. Trying to beat as many enemies as possible is my main tip as to how I'll be progressing. I do admit that I didn't know how to properly use my magic, so I guess I was just kinda under the rock.
Also, remember that this game is onlin' to many people. I am severely spoiled by how well it has run its series, and I am really looking forward to giving it another go.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Ah yes, I'm a big fan of the game. I have a copy lying around somewhere. I wanted to play it for a long time, but I've never
====================
~!~Let's just talk about how Microsoft has been fucked lately.

Phantom Thief: The one thing I can think of that I would love to be sure about Microsoft's future is that we will be able to talk about exactly how Microsoft has been fucked lately. Let's discuss, because what we do talk about has been lit, we talk about how Microsoft has been fucked, and now that we know more about the state of their games, let's take a look back at how things have been for the last couple of months.
First it was CliffyB. He was a software engineer doing things that were outside his scope. Then he came to MS with the most outright terrible product he would ever personally have seen. Then turned his social media account, and now he's done the same. Then they've shipped a product that violates the spirit of his microtransaction terms. They've done the exact opposite these last few years. They've let Satya Nadella's trail-blazing genius go wild, and I just give him credit for handling the worst product he possibly could have possibly set his company in.
So now we're left discussing what Microsoft needs to improve next-gen.
Full disclosure, I'm curious about Sony's backward compatibility initiative. It seems like it is one of the most tenuous solutions I have seen for the PS4. I wouldn't be surprised if it was their worst piece of corporate crime they've ever done.
-----
entremet: I agree with you, but I also believe this is always a very different discussion.
-----
Phantom Thief: To be fair, I do agree with you on the Microsoft/Sony BS. I just don't think Microsoft has been a quality studio for the last few years, they just need to massively improve their internal studios and get a shot at expanding.
-----

====================
~!~Wouldn't it be cool if Nintendo made a new Jack Bros game every 3 years?

Phendrift: That is the question I keep asking and am always curious about the response.
It’s a long and complicated process and I was thinking back on the Switch announcement that said “we are thinking about a smash bros game in 2019.”
Nintendo was a bit off making a Smash Bros game for example.
So what do you guys think? Would you like to see Nintendo make a Switch game?
-----
LewieP: No.
-----
Nanashrew: No. It's like when you get a TV and a PS4.
-----
Odeko: We don’t even have a smash bros yet, do you guys think it’s a good idea?
-----
ShinUltramanJ: I’d rather see them make one every 3 years.
-----
Zalman: We don't even have a smash bros yet.
-----
Knight613: I'd rather see them make one in every 3 years.
It would be a lot more feasible if they made one every 3 years.
-----
Phendrift: That's actually really great haha!
I was excited for that announcement but it’s not a lot of time.
-----
Tofer: We already have a Smash bros game. No need to make one for a few years.
-----
Phendrift: That’s good to know, thanks

~!~What's the best way to play the original Kingdom Hearts series?

Knight in Shining Armani: I've been playing the Kingdom Hearts series for the last few years. And I decided I'd maybe dabble in it if I had the chance, but I'm pretty clueless on what the best way to play the series actually is. It's definitely a huge time sink. 
And then I heard the story is stupid.
And now I've just heard some of the gameplay...
And I realize... That's not the best way to play the series. I heard this is a bad story, and that the gameplay is tedious.
I've also heard the story in the series is horrible.
But I'm clueless.
-----
Joey Pockett: try out the training mode
-----
Jawbreaker: Kingdom Hearts: The Force - Critical
Kingdom Hearts II - Critical
-----
Ratchetdude231: I hear it's a bad story but if that's the case, go for it. Go for Kingdom Hearts.
-----
mrmickfran: KH2 is the best
Chain of Memories - Basically the best
-----
The Last One: I'd suggest the PS2 version of Chain of Memories.
-----
lunarwhale: I think you should play Chain of Memories first. It is amazing.
-----
WrenchNinja: KH2 is the best, but KH1 is still king
-----
Knight in Shining Armani: I didn't even realize the story was stupid.

====================
~!~Do you think we will see a Switch revision in the near future?

Meelow: Nintendo did confirm that there is a Switch revision for some time now, but it is not announced yet, what do you guys think?
-----
Cartridge Games: I think we might see a revision, seems to have some games missing and they’re not selling all over the place.
Nintendo games are still a big success and they can’t go lower down the console
-----
Cartridge Games: I’d say we’ll probably get one to a country you can’t get a Switch. It’s probably a pretty expensive thing to do and maybe they’re just not expecting it’s to be as big as they think.
Wonder if they’ll pull a Pokémon or Mario or something like that.
-----
cw_sasuke: The only one that got a big discount was pokemon.
-----
Medalion: Oh boy...
Switch is doomed...
-----
Atheerios: There's a new Pokémon one that was released last year.
-----
Cybersai: Nintendo is doomed, they have a mobile device out there to get around.
-----
Meelow: I'm thinking maybe next year, they are probably making more Switch games, they don't have mobile games in general.
-----
yuoke: I think it might just be a revision of Mario Odyssey.
-----
Cartridge Games: Yeah, they’ve been really successful with Nintendo.
Pokémon is coming out next year or two and they’re pretty happy with the sales. I think they’ll be pushing more toward 2019

====================
~!~Final Fantasy XV's story and lore seem to have reached a saturation point

Zen: I thought this is thread worthy, because I've been seeing lots of discussions about Final Fantasy XV in the last month or so and a few days and I've got some questions.
The main one is the narrative. I know it's pretty simple, but it's what you do most of the time. We get to see different parts of the city, talk about Noctis's arc, etc. But there are so many details left that we don't get to see, listen to or really notice. It's a story that is told in a way that would make no sense in any other game, so the story is presented in a way that makes no sense whatsoever. The story is simple, it's told in a way that makes no sense whatsoever.
What I want to do is show you a short clip of the story, and then show you where it went, and what it's like. It's something I've been wanting to do for a while, and I know that I know most of the story will be lost in the translation of the game. But I want to show you something that I think is amazing, and that is how much this story has reached a saturation point.
Let's start with the story. I will explain the beginning.
I remember playing a demo on PS3, and I remember thinking "this looks like a PS3 demo, but this actually looks like a PS3 game." But I was young and stupid at that point, it's not, it's the same for most people. I know that the story is stupid, but I also know that it actually has stupid "heroes" and stupid villains, and that's why it's even stupider. But I'm not stupid, I'm stupid.
In the end, the characters are not as stupid as I think they will be in the final game. They are not particularly stupid, they just have a few slightly annoying decisions.
I'm going to explain the characters first.
I know I have been spoiled, but I was aware of the plot before playing the game. I think I know a little about the characters.
I'll explain first two:
I first introduce myself by saying "I'm the one who has heard all the endings". I don't want to spoil anything. I don't want to be spoiled what the final game is going to be
====================
~!~Remember when Nintendo used to only release games for free?

WarpSpeedMolasses: After the massive success of Mario Tennis Aces and Smash Bros. Wii U sales, the ever-growing indie scene of bringing Wii U games made it's way over to Nintendo Switch. I remember reading a magazine called GamesTM that year and it showed that the indie scene was bigger than ever. I think it's a shame to see that the high bars were upped in order to make more games. While we are all aware that there's still a big gap in the market, it's actually pretty clear that the Switch's success has had an adverse effect on the scene.
I don't think my first instance of this happens in that magazine, but I remember back then, when I first tried to get into the game industry, when I was 12, playing LittleBigPlanet and having a hard time with the game mechanics and the lack of local multiplayer, I made a similar attempt on another platform. I was 12, and I was hyped for the game, but was let down when I found out that it didn't have online multiplayer. I ended up playing the PS version on Vita and was happy with it, but not really interested anymore. I remember hearing about how Nintendo was also strict about indie games releasing on Switch, and it meant nothing of value was lost.
The end result is the same thing with the Switch, but then again, it's like that with every platform you could play indies, and you feel like you are just mindlessly playing them.
-----
NarohDethan: I always thought this was a case of when games were still free. I dont think anyone really wants devs to charging for features, and that's why it isnt a concern with Nintendo.
-----
cw_sasuke: Its a shame we did have this gen with some great titles being free.
-----
WonderLuigi: Yup - I was right. It is strange to see devs offering discounts for games that already have a lot of features. Being behind a closed doors and without permission (basically Yooka Laylee) can be grounds for a refund on any game that has been released for over 12 months.
-----
Mondy: I don't think indie games should be bundled with the paid versions of AAA games.
-----
Svart: Yea, but I am now hearing that if I buy

~!~The new God of War has me going places

Toriko: So after a long pause I started and finished reading all the God of War reviews. I am now seriously hooked and after enjoying all the trailers and reading all the impressions about the game I feel like I need to go back to it. I started the game yesterday and just completed the God of War zone.
I have been thinking about it a lot since the first trailer. It is so good. The pacing is just perfect and really well done. I do not think anything could compare to even watching the cut scenes. The gameplay is just pure EXETICALLY fun. The story is one of pure joy and the whole heart mechanic for beating back harder bosses is the GOAT. I do not even know what the Kratos thing is. It is just perfect.
The story is just pure hype and magic. Like holy shit this game is going to set the next level of gaming movie magic.
Just a fun little game to play and I am just blown away. I am not sure what my next avatar to purchase this game will be but I am very jealous. I will pick this up on launch day. 
I am so pumped!
-----
Phendrift: Holy shit. Congrats! 
I’ll definitely try it in a few months
-----
Vicious17: I've been waiting for this game for so long!
-----
Shark: Very excited about this.
-----
The Last Wizard: I’ll wait for a sale.
-----
Aurc: I've been waiting for this game for so long. I can't believe it's releasing so soon. This is SUPEREarly ACCEPTABLE.
-----
Lukemia SL: I’m in for this.
-----

-----
Memento: Im in too. It's a nice surprise
-----
NKnight7: Very excited to play this.

~!~Who made a good soundtrack in the 90's?

King of Dreamland: Just a fun bit of talking about what made a good soundtrack in the 90's for the Sega Master System.
Personally, I always liked the OST for the MD, and it always struck me as a very unique and memorable track to hear.
I’ve always been fascinated by Nintendo compositions, especially the relatively short ones, but I always found these tracks to be a little underappreciated.
-----

hydrophilic attack: i remember listening to a lot of doom metal on youtube when it was around the snes days
-----

raketenrolf: I'm kind of a big fan of the Bombcast's soundtrack. I have to admit that I wasn't a big fan of the Amiga either, for obvious reasons. I got my SNES around the release of Final Adventure with the Super Famicom and it seems like the composer had a hand in some of the composition.
-----
King of Dreamland: I guess I’m a bit biased since I was younger when I discovered that.
I remember hearing the Sonic CD soundtrack was OK, but wasn’t really a fan of the Amiga soundtrack since I heard it was lacking in the 16 bit.
-----
ReyVGM: If you have a Retron5 you might like the ones linked:
-----
King of Dreamland: This one is definitely stand-out.
That one with Sonic drowning is amazing.
-----
sir_crocodile: The one I really remember, to be honest.
-----
Starlatine: That was very good but i miss doomcast

Ben Walker:

Cartridge Games: I'm not going to be surprised if it doesn't last long. I always figured it'd last after the vita.
-----
Oregano: I'm sure they're just going to carry on selling their old docks for the Switch lifetime.
-----
foxuzamaki: I remember the 3DS having a screen protector
-----
Muffin: The switch had a special type of dock...
*still can’t figure out how to Google the term “advice”*
-----
Barsi: Only bought special type of docks for the Switch, I am not surprised they are so expensive anymore.
-----
Tribal24: lol that a really good dock for the switch. they just need to add better lock up for battery life
-----
Channel5News: Man, I had my hopes up!
-----
cw_sasuke: Seems like a pretty good dock for the Switch - and they have said they will add one in the coming months for more budget-friendly prices. 
The screen protector you’ll be dreaming.

~!~[The Verge] Fighting games are killing the fighting game genre. What's next?

JusDoIt: The Verge made a feature on the death of the fighting game genre.
Spoiler
What do you think? Should we take the genre back?
-----
Abriael: Fighting games have killed the fighting genre.
-----
ReyVGM: They aren't even clones of the genre.
-----
hussien-11: I think it's a really easy "come back" for the genre. 
I think the games in that article are more popular than ever. 
I think it's a shame too because the genre is still pretty young and unexplored, but it's still fun and interesting in it's own right.
-----
gnilres: As someone who has been a fan of the genre for years now, I agree. I'm glad the industry is moving to a pure sequels style of development.
-----
Mediking: Fighting games are at a peak now. They play well and have great graphics and sound. 
Also, the games have more replayablity nowadays.
-----
Omar310: Fighting games are like zombies in movies. Movies have become a lot more relaxed and non-intense.
-----
Saucycarpdog: I feel like we've reached an "X genre is such a hot genre" point.
-----
BioDigital Jazzman: I really need to try and revisit this genre. I’m not sure if it’s dead or not anymore. I know I’m not the only who likes that genre. I kinda wish I tried a new genre like RTS’ or something.
-----
CaviarMeths: I hope when next gen hits and we hear more about the genre the industry will realize that it's dead and that fighting games are no more relevant than dark souls or gears of war.
Fighting games are very much the zombies in movies. There's a reason why people want to watch movies, but I think the barrier to entry needs to be lowered.

~!~LTTP: The Witcher 3 - "The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest game of all time"

Maxey: In the wake of The Witcher 4, as well as other underappreciated and acclaimed games, I thought I might give The Witcher 3 a chance.
So I bought it on a sale a few months ago, and I had a pretty good time with it.
The main reason I got it was because of how good The Witcher 3 is.
The story is, to me, something really special. It's my first CDPR game and I have to say, this game is something really special.
The characters are all excellently putisprising, the writing is just superb,
gameplay is addicting,
and you can turn the camera all you want,
and you can do almost everything in one go.
I mean, just listen to this:
And read some great reviews:
So, I'll start off with a bit of a rant,
and get to the point:
The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest game of all time.
TW3 is arguably the best game of all time.
TW3 has a great story,
characters, level and progression system,
great decisions and consequences,
great open world role system,
great voice acting,
great modding potential,
great open world mechanics,
and so on. There are so many things that this game excels in every conceivable category,
and it's actually impressive how well it draws all these things into play:
From the storytelling, to the level design, to the difficulty and progression,
It's a masterpiece.
-----
TheBaldwin: One of the best games of last year, well done game
-----
Maxey: I was expecting something quite big. "What if The Witcher 3 was a 4 player rpg?"
-----
Tibarn: I agree, I was expecting something huge, like Bethesda did for Fallout 4.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: The best game of this generation, best RPG this gen and one of the best games of all time, well said.
-----
Interficium: I agree, one of the biggest games of the generation.
-----
Aters: I'll never get tired of some Souls-style action RPGs.
-----
Hailinel: I enjoyed the game a lot,

~!~What are the best and worst of the Naruto games?

SolVanderlyn: I've been curious about this for a while. I always felt like the series was best for people who don't know about the series, like myself. But I'm also curious about how the series is played in comparison to the anime and the games themselves.
I'm looking for things that are:
Casual
Hard
Fun
Strategy
Fighting
And other types of games that are played in order and don't follow the exact story.
I also want things that are both casual and hard, since I don't know anything about the series.
-----
sibarraz: The first Naruto game has extremely weird setpieces
Naruto fanservice video is the best part of the game
-----
Strings: The one with the Naruto village. Always loved that one, and the art style is pretty great:
-----
NarohDethan: I think the more you know about what the story is all about, the more you can understand.
-----
sibarraz: Since the last thread, I realized that this is a similar thread, asking what games do you consider casual.
-----
Strings: A good amount of what I consider casual, but they're not quite as broad as "Hardcore." I do think Naruto has an amazing story with a bunch of inexplicably goofy characters (or, for example, characters like Namco characters that are outright bad), but the anime is brutal, and there's charm in the characters, and it's all relatively unique. If the series isn't for you, I guess maybe it's okay if you're a Naruto fan.
-----
NarohDethan: I dont know about casual or hard, but anime is a more vague term than the film or tv show for something like anime/video games, and it has the potential to be more diverse.
-----
Weiss: Naruto: The orphan club.
-----
sibarraz: How many of the games does the series have?
-----
sibarraz: Not a whole lot

Strafer: This is a bit of a corny tweet (quoted twice) but it rings in my head:
It's not just a transphobic tweet either. It's a tweet that rings extremely out of place in basically all of her experiences with people who are equally awful.
-----
SofNascimento: That's not okay.
-----
SofNascimento: I mean, I have to do something to get this.
-----
Acquiescence: I hate it.
-----
Skittles: Sounds like a good amount of privilege
-----
Masterspeed: Dumb Twitter arguments sound very progressive. I'm glad TLOU2 is the subject of consumer culture's most empathy. 
Can't say I empathize with someone who is past the times she's been in to characters in video games. Granted Ellie is not really a character in and of itself and I have no reason to be so. 
It's just a dumb twitter bait tweet to try and garner clicks.
-----
Masterspeed: I don't think that's what this is. This is not an attack on feminism. Not at all. 
It's just a bait and switch.
-----
GiantHurtBall: It makes me sick too.
-----
Masterspeed: Cracking it, okay?

~!~Tetris is the best "meme" of the generation.

Toriko: In light of the recent success of Tetris 99 , I decided to revisit Tetris 99 and immerse myself in the feeling of gaming for many years. I first played it in 2004 in a Comix Zone and was blown away. I loved Tetris because it is a great relaxing game and is a celebration of gaming. Tetris was the first game I ever played and it was a pure relaxing game. I felt like playing a traditional mahjong game. That is all. I played Tetris for over 3 hours straight at that time and was filled with nostalgia.
Fast forward many years later and the game is now my favorite gaming experience ever and I cannot wait for it to come out to PC and Switch. I have a backlog of over 200 games and I think I have quite the collection. I feel that I am close to the end of my gaming journey and I would love to piece it together so I can all get ready for gaming's end in 2019.
What games are you playing this year? I think the following are :
Fallout 76
Super Mario Odyssey
Smash Ultimate
Splatoon 2
Fortnite
Hollow Knight
Hollow Knight
PAX
COD: BO4
Wario Land
Bayonetta 2
Bayonetta 3
Bayonetta 2: Future Past
And other games I am not going to list :
Xenoblade Chronicles 2
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe
Kirby Star Allies
Thief of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
The Evil Within
Overwatch
And more I will add.
-----
Svart: 
-----
Cartridge Games: Splatoon 2 is the only way to play.
I don’t think it’s the best meme, but the games are so great.
-----
Silky: I've got you can eat
-----
-shadow-: I feel like I've been saying this for so long and even longer, this is the thread of the gen where you're all ready to cry in peace, right?
-----
Toriko: Nope, and I will never, ever play games for the simple fact that they are the best part of their respective medium. There is literally no single good gaming meme that is Tetris. There are tons of awesome games that absolutely can and should be played.
====================
~!~I've finally gotten a gaming PC and... it's a GTX 1070.

Real Renaissance Man: This is the first time I've ever gotten a gaming PC. I'd say I'm pretty good with high end graphics cards so having a great gaming PC is great. Yet I'm still getting shit for getting it. The build quality is just weird, the card is starting to look like a mid gen graphics card, the drivers are not great, and the iGPU is really weak. So I've been trying to get better performance out of this so that I can play at 1080p60fps and 1440p ultra high resolutions in a relatively comfortable package.
However...
- Is the iGPU good? The build quality seems really good to me. I'm not huge into PC's but always at least somewhat capable of 1080p gaming. It's essentially a non bottlenecked single core 4 core box with a floating point rate for a lower price.
- Is the 4GB RAM good? The memory is limited for sure but I think the ram is very good. I know the CPU is a One Piece performance demon which makes it so it can run at 4K60 or 1440p or whatever in a relatively comfortable package. It also has a Turbo mode.
- Is the 4GB RAM good? I think so. I'm not a very interested in performance mode especially with the Nvidia cards. I know the most demanding games like Doom and Wolfenstein 2 will run at 1080p or 1440p or something but I'm not so good at computer programming that I'm sure.
- Does the 8GB limited edition have an internal expansion pack?
Real Renaissance Man: I know the 8GB is limited, but what's the benefit of it? Is it limited to the limited edition for your money, or is there a compatibility with the store version?
Real Renaissance Man: I don't really know. I'd rather not sell it but am probably over my 100% sure I'd rather not sell it.
-----
Crayon: I've been wanting a bit more resolution. 
I got a couple years of raytracing money over the years. I can't imagine wanting to sacrifice the resolution of the card for the game. 
I'm not sure. I think the price is a little silly. I get the same units for about ten quidoes.

Aeana: The 8GB card is pretty good. It

~!~Why is there no new info on the new Star Wars game?

Zukkoyaki: I think the leaked schedule for the new Star Wars game and the Star Wars 2064: Republic Base info reached a point where they'd want to make sure the game is ready for release and they're confident enough to justify a release date.
That being said, what is the deal with this?
-----
Kyoufu: It's a leaked release date.
-----
Knight613: It was leaked a year ago.
-----
Sub Boss: I think its just a year ago
-----
Usyren: I think that it is a leaked release date.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: The only thing we know is that it's a 2019 game and it's gonna be released on the end of December
-----
Nirolak: They had a little chat with people on the Force via the comments above, where they kind of confirmed it.
-----
Servbot24: I think it was a bit of a surprise to everyone.
-----
Hops: It's just a bit of a surprise.
-----
Kenzodielocke: I mean, it almost certainly is coming out at the end of the month.

CountAntonius: They have done a couple of big events recently with Hype Check and they are doing it on this page.

Howdyjumper: I heard lots of great things about it. Hopefully they hit that Early Access goal by the end of the year

~!~What is the best way to find out what is the best controller for the Switch?

mogster7777: I have a small pic book in my closet and I’ve been trying to find the best controller for the switch. 
It’s not the best option for the console but it’s what it is. So my question is what is the best method for getting the best controllers. I’ve read that controllers can take up to 8 weeks to build, right? A couple of my friends have been using a 9’0 controller and it’s becoming a regular controller and I have a 9’0 one week early.
So it’s a little bit more limited but I’ve got a few extra controllers I need to start getting hyped for and they are all expensive. My first controller I’d use was a launch one and I was pretty happy with it.
-----
Dyna: I'm pretty sure Nintendo won't force you to buy a new controller if you have to take it out of your console.
-----
Cybersai: The launch ones don't have a thumbstick, and if you don't take them out of the dock you'll get a garbage controller.
-----
skeezx: just get a new one
-----
Syril: I've got a launch one and a launch controller both. I'm not sure if I'd call the Switch's design unstable and too small for it, since it's asymmetrical, but the design of the bumpers on the Switch's controllers are just awful. I haven't played it much anyway but know the developers have tried some different bumpers and asymmetrical design.
-----
Parvaati: I’m kind of interested in a new controller. I like the idea of a 3DS pad being used for a touchpad, but it’s also just a massive improvement on the DS4.
-----
mogster7777: I’m not sure about the bumpers on the Switch controller. I think the bumpers are just bigger lol.
-----
Zonic: Hmm, a regular PS4 controller will fit in your hand?
-----
Swift_Gamer: The Switch is the ultimate HD console. 
You can use it for everything. In fact, it is one of the reasons I love the Switch so much.

~!~LTTP: Final Fantasy 7 (long and commanding)

Thebeast!: I played ff7 when it came out and was like 20 hours in, and loved it. good old school final fantasy. ff9 was also good but was just not my cup of tea.
a few months ago I got the PS4 port of ff7 and was amazed at the graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and graphics and so I got this and enjoyed it.
after that I played ff9 on the 3ds and was amazed that the game holds up and how well it holds up.
so what are your favorite final fantasy final fantasies? I think the one I really enjoyed was final fantasy 6 but I think it holds up better than 9. 
let me know what you think.
-----
halcali: Final Fantasy 8. WOOOOOOW.
-----
Cybersai: Final Fantasy 8 is the best final fantasy.
And it's not even close.
-----
Syril: The one I really enjoy. The story is great and the music is fantastic.
-----
HylianSeven: FFT.
I hate that you can't choose between the two Final Fantasy games, the gameplay was the only one that really appealed to me and it's even better now.
-----
Wazilevskij: Final Fantasy 8 is the my favorite Final Fantasy game and it's a shame that it's the only Final Fantasy game I haven't finished.
-----
Djinn: 9 was my first Final Fantasy and it's a pretty great game.
-----
Ryouji Gunblade: Final Fantasy 9. The game was so good, and the music was by far the best in the series.
-----
Dazraell: I love Final Fantasy 7 but Final Fantasy 8 is my most favorite final fantasy ever.
-----
Cantatmom: Personally I think it's the most important final fantasy to me. So good.
I guess I would go with Final Fantasy 9. It's not as good as the other final fantasy games in the series. But I just love the world and atmosphere of this game so much.

What would y'all recommend?
-----
BringBackSonics: Until there is a console that has at least 3x the specs of a PS4 Pro, PS4 should you get a PS4 Pro.
-----
Kokonoe: I'd get a PS4 Pro and a 4K TV.

sredgrin: I think you've overestimate how powerful the PS4 is.
It's not even over a PS4 Pro baseline.
-----
Kiro: I would get a PS4 Pro. Although I don't know if that includes a Pro since then.
-----
KSI: You’ll get a PS4 in the future.

I hope Halo Reach isn’t locked to the 360. I would love an official MCC version.

SnatcherHunter: Is that a thing?
-----
Theorry: No.

Maneil99: That would be a great idea.

SnatcherHunter: Its on Xbox One.

DrDeckard: I would be down for this, but no. I'd rather have a 360 version that's more than playable. I would rather it was a thing

~!~What are the best non-open world games?

Nabbit: So with the launch of RDR2 and with the rumours of some huge releases for next year, I thought it would be interesting to hear from the current landscape on what people consider to be the best open world games of all time.
I've been thinking about this in an attempt to not only list some of the greatest games of all time (though I have my own favourites), but to also try and generate discussion about which games do you think are the best ones. This is not a ranking thread, but an effort to see what people consensus systems are for a game regardless and is open to feedback.
I'll start us off
OPPOSED GAME
RDR2 - RDR2 is the definitive open world game of this generation and I would argue it is the best one for this. RDR1 is a technical marvel and graphical quality is some of the greatest ever. 
BOTW - This is a long and involved game and I would still rank it ahead of RDR2. But in general, it's a great open world game with great wilderness - very similar to Witcher 3, but with a lot of focus, lots of activities and exploration. The main thing about BotW is the sense of wonder, and wonder can be boiled down to just Zelda climbing the mountains in the original Watch out BOTW.
Honorable mention: Assassin's Creed III Gold Edition
-----
Maximo: I don't think you can go wrong with any of these.
-----
Zetta: Light RPG, story, exploration, fishing, side quests, puzzles and side quests.
-----
Nabbit: I'm going to go ahead and say I've never played RDR2, which is a very obviously open world game at times.
-----
Svart: Seasons after the main quests.
-----
Maximo: BOTW is a great example of this. It's more open than RDR2 and just has way more activities etc.
-----
Skronk: I just love the wilderness part of BotW. I can't think of a single good open world game but I would say it's the best overall.
-----
Jackpot: BOTW and RDR2 are the best ones.
-----
noyram23: I mean, the main reason to play RDR2 is probably you just want that perfect RPG

~!~I've finally hit on the PS4's "Hard Drive"

KDR_11k: So I'm out and about in a local thread about my backlog. I've been playing a lot of PC games lately, and have recently decided to give myself a bit of extra space so that I can play all the games I own that I've been playing for years. I've recently come to the conclusion that I really need to go back to a few games from my PS3 backlog because of Redout, the Crash Trilogy on PS2, and Final Fantasy X.
Redout:
- On Sale for $7 on PSN. I've never played the game, but it looks fun. I've heard a lot of mixed reception, so I'm looking for something more positive. I'm looking for a bit more substance, and some more praise, but I know there's no definitive answer to this.
Final Fantasy X:
- I've had this game for a few years now. I just got a PS4 for ~$50 which is pretty great but I always sort of wish I'd paid more for it. But I've been kind of burned out on online MP games and have only been playing a few matches. I suppose I have some games left, but this is just me and my dog. I'm ok paying extra for this.
Crash Team Racing:
- I've been trying to watch the Sonic movie asap and to just play it this far, but I've been needing to play Crash Team Racing more and it's been kind of hard. 
Sonic Mania:
- I have a PS3. I bought this one for $15 and it's been fantastic. I played enough of it to last 50 hours. 
Sonic Mania Plus:
- This is the first game on PS4 I've seen. I'm looking forward to getting more into it and I'm loving the game so far. 
Shadow of the Tomb Raider:
- I've seen a lot of praise for this game and wanted to get it but I've heard some negative buzz around it. 
I have a PS3 and a PC (I'm happier with my current setup though I don't have a PS4 either way) so I know I'll be doing a lot of research on getting a handle on it, but I'm not holding my breath for the PC version. 
I'm not going to say

~!~Incineroar: "My PS4 Pro is a Mess and My Hardwares Dumbass Death"

TransEuropaExpress: ​"Incineroar, a Brazilian developer, made a video discussing his creation of a new console towering ahead of schedule ps5 launch in 2019. Incineroar, who you would think is the best Brazilian developer at PS4, posted this video saying he had no troubles with the launch of the PS5 and more about his PS4 Pro, and the death of his family and his electronics. 
"So just a major pain in the ass and death of my girls I can't speak to yet, but yeah, I have to deal with a shortage of parts, and also I can't stress and worry my family, but what they told me, maybe there will be a price drop... I can't speak to that yet, but I hope that it is possible," he explained.
-----
Khanimus: I mean, that's not a problem.
-----
KillerMan91: Proporcious. Propping up a family of a dead console's worth of components is a nightmare. But it's a problem that requires the PS4 and not the Pro either.
-----
Phantom Thief: Damn, that's a lot of components. Proprietary parts, no doubt.
-----
Sagadego17: proplaning of stuff is expensive and taking it to a private place to do it is expensive
-----
Memento: Proprietary parts? No way.
-----
Shark: I'm still amazed we even have a console with a Pro.
-----
Gestault: Proprietary parts? Are you saying that's not a problem?
-----
KennyX: I mean, its not that costly, just pointing out that it's a problem is not a problem.
-----
Dphex: proprietary parts...proprietary parts.

Tizoc: This is a pretty interesting move.

Kyoufu: What a time to be alive.

Tizoc: I don't know if I can get my physical gear back, but I can get my physical game back.
-----
dan2026: My old machine from a decent ass mid-1980s is gone.
I don't know what I was doing with my PC but playing the game.
-----
WaffleTaco: I can’t imagine playing some of this stuff in FF6 when it was around with the fucking weirdo with the goddamn mechs. The thing with the mechs is they are surprisingly dangerous. I’m sure it’s a fixture in the Mobius games, but FF6 is different.
-----
Lkr: I hope that is a good thing or no
-----
Jawmuncher: I feel like this is a good direction to go in general. There is a lot of room for FF6 to be advertised as FF8. Maybe the 2 games are just that.
-----
WaffleTaco: I think that's a good thing. I mean, I know it’s going to be the FF7 machine but FF6 did have a lot of issues with its stuff.
-----
Raxious: I mean, we've already moved on to FF7 Remake so I don't think we need another one.

====================
~!~I'm ready to forgive all the shitty decisions Sony has made in the last few years

Toriko: So I'm replaying the PS2 era and I find myself agreeing with most posts here on pretty much every point in the post.
To me, the one commonality was how Sony tweaked the MGS series to fit in with their live system which was simply adding a new level of fourth wall breaking and innovation to the series.
Sony tried to recreate the glory days of the PS2 via the XBOX360 remaster but their Live Service model of the remaster had already gone a complete over turn. Sony tried back in the PS3 days but the way they marketed the remaster made it clear to me that it was a pittance in comparison.
So I bought a PS2 and I picked up the collection of MGS and The Last of Us which I had on stock at the time.
I played and completed all of the games on this collection and I really enjoyed them. The first game is god of war style pure action and it’s so good I finished it twice. The second game is a testament to how amazing Sony has got the PS2 back through the PS4. They added new content to the series and added tons of my favourite games ever, including some of the most beautiful and best cut content ever seen in a game. 
The next game had all the cool stuff but it’s a bit of a let down. The second game is just as fun but the second game is a massive step down in how it feels to play. It’s a shame because it was a fantastic PS2 game. The level design is just a lot less consistent and it doesn’t really create replay value. I have already played and completed the first game twice. I prefer the second game but it’s still a huge step down from the first game. So much of their marketing around the second game had me baffled and frankly bored. 
Hopefully ReCore can recapture the attention of the PS2 REMASTERS.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think it’s a decent game but they did do horrible remastering.
It’s not a solid game, tho.
Imagine playing Bloodborne with the Xbone controller that had a second screen.
-----
Lant_War: Remastering is one thing, re-imagining is another.

====================
~!~Does anyone else get excited for a game announcement/reveal trailer?

Araujo: I think this is the best way to describe it all.. we're getting a new Pokemon/Smash/Pokemon/Smash(whatever) game announcement at E3, and we're already seeing Geoff casually hopping over to take the stage and announce it. 
However, we're not getting such a surprise trailer for games.. We got the Persona 5 reveal a few weeks ago, and we got the new Tomb Raider trailer, and those were just E3 reveal trailers. 
So in short.. we're definitely not getting a reveal trailer for most games we see this year. We might get a trailer for games that we know we want, but only then can we get our mind blown excitement about games we know we want.
It's not as though every game we see is a smash bros clone, and it's not like the industry's holding the world's attention for any game we see this year. But, given the rising prevalence of big AAA games announced for 2019, and what we know of Smash and Pokemon, I think many people are excited for titles to come out in 2019, and it's not like we're getting such a revelation that we won't see it. 
So, what do you guys think? Is there any game you would have hype for if given a title reveal trailer instead of a reveal trailer?
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: I feel like there's a new Smash trailer every month and I expect it to be this month
-----
DGenerator: I know the last few months have seen the most incredible trailers, but as for actual announcements, we have seen nothing since September.
-----
ASaiyan: I think that is the way of announcing games.
-----
louisacommie: I feel like ubisofts next smash is going to be a smash bros remake
-----
Serebii: I think it’s just a Smash trailer
-----
KZXcellent: It's probably just a Smash trailer.
-----
Wolfgunblood: Not really.
-----
Porygon: It's not a trailer I want, I want a reveal trailer

CaviarMeths: Whenever there's an impending announcement it's a trailer. I love the trailer and would be happy to be proven wrong though.

====================
~!~What's your favorite game (or movie) of all time.

SolVanderlyn: I'll start with one that has been imitated a dozen times.
NES: The Legend of Zelda
-The Oasis is one of the most consistently excellent and charming games I have ever played. I feel like I have played every Zelda game and can say with 100% certainty that Zelda 1 is the most iconic of all of them. It's a "Graphic Adventure" level adventure game, taking place in the World of Shadow, a place where our PCs live in. The PCs are in this factory, occupied since the First Storm, and their only means of information is to keep warm and water out. Everything is going well, and things are going well. The factory owner has a machine, this robotic thing that can give you directions, a map, a painting, and a list of all the areas of the factory. It can tell you every item, item, and location of the main machines. The machine can see all kinds of things, it can see the boss, and a lot of it is this pink clay. The pink clay is the end, the whole thing is gone, and you are left wondering what is anymore of this pink clay.
Zelda 1: The Wind Waker
-The game takes place in the first major region of the game, the first town. There's a woman there, and the machine is there guiding you and telling you about all the animals and items that have been revealed. You walk up to the machine and it tells you that the First Storm has destroyed the Pinkle, and the Pinkilove have become the Pinkhe. You then see a large part of the city destroyed, and the Triforce are scattered about, and the Master Sword has returned, leaving you to face the final boss at the end of the world. This is basically a Zelda game, you are the Master Sword, you are now in this world, being controlled by the machines, and having to find out what this pink clay known as the Wind Waker is capable of, the Master Sword goes on display, and the Master Sword itself is on display in the Master System.
-The game is pretty great. I don't think the first ever to take place in a cyberpunk setting ever got a sequel/successor, and the first game that does is Breath of the Wild.
-Zelda is a pretty fantastic world to

~!~Is Ghost of Tsushima worth my time?

Borowski: I have a strong feeling it will sell pretty quickly, I really want to play it, but I have high hopes it will be a fun, and also mature, experience
the gameplay I have come to like is seamless, the story is interesting, I dont care about the graphics, also the atmosphere is good, the music is good too, the gameplay is fun, and the world is cool.
I am very much in the camp of the "it's not a big deal but something to be scared of and never have to worry about".
I would love to play a game like this, but I have high hopes.
-----
Soph: I'd have to admit I loved the world. It's a great game and I'm excited this new take on a genre that hasn't been explored in the series for ages.
-----
texhnolyze: How is the gameplay?
I have a good idea of what the gameplay is like, but I've heard the same people who say the game is sluggish or slow, so is it take a long time to get used to that?
-----
bobeth: I personally liked it, but I don't know if the story and characters are anything to my liking. I had fun at first with it, but it's not something I can get into now.
-----
Kolx: I think it's a really fun game but I found the multiplayer to be a bit short. It's not a bad game by any means but it's not something that I can enjoy at all.
-----
chandoog: You care about the world ? No ?
You care about that there are characters you don't care about ?
No ?
It's a good game and it's worth your time.
-----
TheBaldwin: The story is amazing, and the gameplay is fun but i feel it gets pretty repetitive if you play the tutorial. 
I dunno if i would say it's worth a 7 but if so, i think it's worth at least a 7.
-----
Yaqza: It's a fun game. But, I feel that it slows you down, and by that point the story is so hype, that it's not a very long game at all. 
I had a good time with it, and I'm not sure if that's what you

~!~Are the retail prices for Nintendo Switch games like this?

TheMink: Yeah I know it’s not the best example but I was wondering as well what the typical retail price for games on Switch is on the eShop. It’s $19.99 for the Switch and $39.99 for the same units.
If I’m understanding correctly it seems the retail price is $19.99.
I was wondering if they are more like Game Stop or Target which is $19.99.
-----
Neoxon: The eShop is probably more reflective of GameStop’s stock price than GameStop.
-----
Cartridge Games: I guess GameStop has more vouchers, but yeah.
Neither is anywhere near GameStop for the price
-----
Cartridge Games: There’s a lot more on the eShop compared to eShop
-----
Atheerios: They're far more reflective of the stock price.
-----
Cartridge Games: I’d say GameStop is definitely more reflective.
The eShop has more gamerscore so it’s more reflective.
-----
Oddish: Less on the eShop though. There are higher stock, lower price and a lot more retailers have less clearance and less stores to sell electronics.
-----
Neoxon: Correct. And $19.99 is currently The Last Leg of the Switch’s stock debut.
-----
Cartridge Games: The eShop has a lot more stores to sell electronics, more retailers to sell electronics, and a lot more retailers to sell online.

m23: Less is more definitely a losing proposition.
If I was in the wrong about a sale being local, I just would pick up a game cheaper from Gamestop.

~!~Moe games where I pick a bunch of enemies and then fly/fly the plane around, and then one very small room with a big boss or fighter and then one big boss or fighter and then one big plane thing
Pokemon- Smash- Souls-craft- FPS- GTA-RPG- RPG- MOBAs- Splatoon- Battlefield- etc
I want to replay the last decade or so with a bunch of games. I don't have time for the backlog. I want to dive into all the older stuff that's not on the list.
I tried:
- Child of Light
- Rise of Ninja
- Dark Souls
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- Zelda: Breath of the Wild
- Mario Odyssey
- Splatoon 2
- The Witcher 3
- Horizon ZD
- Xenoblade Chronicles 2
- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
- The Last of Us
- Horizon: Zero Dawn
- Halo: Reach
- Horizon ZD
- Yakuza 0
- Bayonetta 0
- Fire Emblem Warriors
- Soulcalibur VI
- etc
I'm not sure what else I could look at. I see myself playing Ghost Recon Wildlands or looking forward to playing Dwarf Fortress on the toilet at some point.
I'm not particularly interested in Doom (I'm a third-person guy), or Halo (I spent more time playing Halo: Fireteam than I did playing any single FPS since Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and I'm only 30 hours in), or Life is Strange or Fire Emblem (I never cared for Fire Emblem, but all the games are good), or very recently played FFXIV.
I'm not particularly interested in stuff that has an emphasis on puzzles or platforming, or is linear, or has a lot of collectibles. I'm especially interested in games where I want to look at a lot before starting, and then look at a game when I want to play something else.
I don't know if I can look at stuff from the backlog, but I know I shouldn't. I have a lot in there and I want to dive into them.
-----
Theswweet: I don't think you'll ever find anything new in the game, but you'll get maybe 10-15 hours worth of enjoyment out of it.

Silky: There's nothing wrong with playing games for a few hours and then going back to playing something else

~!~The new DOOM game is so good

Jarmel: I've been playing the DOOM (Electroically* Enhanced Edition) collection on my laptop for a while now, and it's been a lot of fun.
The graphics are amazing, the level design is top notch, and the puzzles are fun.
However, the game is so slow, and it's such a pain in the otherwiseinger. Just moving around the room while holding a torch for the first time was a lot of fun.
But I can't do that in the DOOM style, and neither does anyone else.
The only way I can describe it is:
Doobot is slow, but I'm enjoying it.
I just can't seem to get into the level design, and I'm just now getting bored of the level design.
I feel like I'm just in a small section and it's making me not want to play the game.
I just want to just get to the first boss.

Starlatine: I love this threads, I got it for about three dollars on the xbox store website. It looks like the worst of the ones you mentioned

Clive: When it first released on PC, I thought it was a port of the PS2 port and I thought it was fine. I never played it since then but it seems to be gaining momentum.

Miker: I agree with the OP. One thing I'll add to the OP is that I'm having fun with the game. When I play it's all about the grind and the other players are also very fun.

Dylan: It's very disappointing that such a long-lasting game is being made in such a short time: I'm not even sure I'm getting old.

~!~Why do games still not do an amount to showcase their HDR implementation?

Benji: HDR is one of the most talked about features in media and gaming as of today. However some games do not have the extra attention from the technology nor do they use it as heavily as other features. Many developers and consumers are looking to the next gen as a bridge to get the most out of the HDR signal. We are in a time of diminishing returns for HDR as the tech can only afford so many more years of adoption. 
For example my launch Shadow of the Tomb Raider has had zero HDR support ever since launch. It is still the most popular game in the UK for the most part but that can be said for most mainstream titles too. We are at the point now where next gen we can expect to see more games using hdr even more. That is why even on Xbox One X and PS4 Pro until 2023 we can see hdr support. Not only the difference in processing power between XB1 and PS4 but also the lack of it in the XB1X reduce the chances of future consoles being able to push hdr even more with the new consoles.
So why does this still not happen?
-----
Solid: Most games have HDR support, Sony and Microsoft are the only ones who are willing to push it ahead of the gap, and even Nintendo struggles to push the most.
-----
Smurf: Well, if you count emulateds, you have Pro support and SMP.
-----
Kolx: Things like 4k support will still happen but it's hard to see them extend themselves to the same level as games.
-----
DBtB: The most impressive thing about games running at 4k has been realized again and again. Not just the resolution of the game but the difference in graphical effects on it.
HDR is just too small now.
-----
Roldan: If you're talking about games that support HDR, then yeah, you're absolutely correct.
-----
Gbraga: That's the reason I'm glad I have a PS4 Pro, I don't use it as much as I should, but it's just not enough for me to want HDR.
-----
Strakt: You can do it and be happy with it, but a lot of games are just pushing the resolution too far and it's not realistic in this day and age.

~!~Your Favorite Sonic Game

max.rem: This isn't a contest, son. Please don't make a thread about what your favorite Sonic game is. It should be a topic about the games you love and think together.
I've always been a big fan of Sonic 1 and particularly 2. Sure, it is a bit "dark" to play as a robot boy, but I love the stages. I was blown away by the music. I remember playing the opening to Perfect Chaos 3 to death. My favorite being this one. It was on the full scale.
That being said, let's share some of my favorite games.
Sonic 1 - The Lost Levels (Sonic Adventure)
Sonic 2 - Unleashed
Sonic Adventure came out in 1994 and it was some believe it was the fastest paced Sonic game out to that point. I remember the game is an origin story for Sonic, you had to go through 3 generations of enemies before you could start leveling up. You had to unlock powers and vehicles in order to jump across the world and survive the tougher enemies. It wasn't until Unleashed that the game really began to surpass its 2nd half. Unleashed is a bit shorter though and I didn't really like the story as much as I remember it. I really liked the atmosphere though.
Sonic 3 & Knuckles - Emerald Snail & Crystal
First of all, I want to say the Sega Genesis version is the best Sonic game from Sega. It really changed the way the 2D games in the franchise could play. The level design was absolutely perfect. You had to go through a main theme (the main theme is awesome) to unlock special abilities that you could unlock by simply jumping and then going through the stage. The stages were great too. The story was epic as well and so was the music. The game was perfect for it. It also had a knack for being aboutcy. The game also had the best music (apart from Perfect Chaos) and probably the best level design.
Sonic 1 & Knuckles
Sonic Adventure
Sonic Adventure 2
Sonic Team Racing
Franchise may not be the most Sonic franchise but they nailed the formula perfectly. The 2D games were the first proper ones and it was the best game they've done up until that point.

~!~Bought a PS4 and now playing God of War

JusDoIt: I've been a PS4 player for about a decade now, and now I've just got my PS4 to myself. I just realized that it's only ~1.5 months since the game released, and I'm still a PS4 owner. That's an accomplishment I'm proud to tell you.
I'm playing the game right now, and I'm not far into the game. I think it's not that long, but I need some healing. So, what should I be looking out for?
1. What kind of healing potions should I expect?
2. How do you feel about using healing items?
3. Is there anything I should be wary of?
4. How long has the game been in the "play" for you?
5. Have you tried roulettelling and the various challenges?
-----
Phantom Thief: Try to play with friends.
-----
Rosebud: You can play the game with friends, that's great, you can play offline.
-----
dipship31: Just play God of War with friends. It's a great game
-----
Memento: Yes, do not play with friends.

Viceratops: Everyone should play the game. The longer it gets, the bigger the hole becomes in your brain for interaction.
-----
Gravity Insanity: Play with friends!
-----
dipship31: um

Rosebud: I think it will keep you busy for a while, some friends of mine have a friend who plays with us ( though we haven't played together in years. :P ) so it's not like you can't try new things.

Phantom Thief: Yes, you can play with friends.

~!~Should I start a new Pokémon franchise? What should it do?

♡♪♪: What do you think should be the franchise, what should it try to do, I.e. should it try to adapt itself, or try to change itself?
-----
Joseki: People are gonna expect you to want Pokémon to be a franchise and do something different every time.
-----
Funyarinpa: They should just drop the anime in favour of a console one.
-----
Kain-Nosgoth: I think it's the right move, it's a big franchise (over 10m worldwide, that's over 3x that it took in the first place) and they have the right set of fans to make it happen
-----
kurahador: First try to be a Pokémon game that can stand up to the big N. VIII series.
-----
Zippro: Let's Go, Sun and Moon, Pokémon GO, and Smash.
-----
Zalman: They should try to adapt themselves with the same franchises that made itself popular during the past generation.
-----
Fosko: Let's Go, Sun and Moon and Pokémon
-----
Snormy: If Nintendo doesn't want to do a spin-off then I don't care what they try.
I'm not a fan of the current attempts at doing Pokémon spin-offs however. The only Pokemon game that I know of that did really well was Smash and I know that was because of the success of Pokémon.
For spinoffs I guess.
-----
Clov: I've always been a fan of the series, but I was never really a fan of the games. It's not that they're bad, it's that they're rather poorly executed. I actually think they're at the least slightly worse than the ones they were at the beginning, but they rarely managed to get any better for me.

====================
~!~PSA: Sony has not been posting new games for a while now

KrigareN-High: X-Wing & Destiny 2 are the two franchises I've been thinking about the most about for some time. I'm glad that they're being developed, but the lack of new games has me wondering if they're just dead and forgotten or if anyone else has been enjoying their output. 
I've seen a lot of threads lately reviving old franchises, including this excellent one:
And this one
But I wonder if it's been dormant for some time and if the current crop of new and/or currently unannounced AAA IPs are just the tip of the iceberg? Do you think we'll see more of the same old thing in the next few years? 
What are your thoughts/alxuses?
-----
SageShinigami: 
-----
KZXcellent: It's not just about new IP. PS4/Xbone and Switch as well. I think there's a good chance we'll see new IPs pop up on the horizon but I can't see any AAA IPs popping up in 2018.

~!~I can't "connect" Xbox 360 devices

MCD: I recently bought a new 360 to connect to my Xbox One. I'm not sure if the benefits are there, but I'm getting some really annoying issues. I have to start from the home screen, and the system has an auto-detect button that if you push it will detect if I connect or start a game, etc. I have to be in the games menu, and I have to start the controller off of the Xbox, then the controller is gone. I have to start the controller off of the Xbox, then the Xbox, and then the controller is dead. I've tried everything I can think of to connect, but none of the methods I tried seemed to work.
I have a crappy Power Ranger x360 (sold in a second time) and the XRGB chip that came with it. I've tried everything. I've tried to run the controller off of the Xbox, but it doesn't work. I've used a second power source. I've even tried everything the Xbox hardware emulators offered, and it doesn't work either.
I've tried running the controller off of the XRGB chip. All of them. All of them. I've even tried a third party adapter, but it doesn't work either.
I've tried everything. I've even tried docked. No dice. The only thing that works, by the Emulators I've tried, is keeping the XB1X and XB1S connected to the controller.
I've looked online and tried different devices. But no dice.
But, I really don't understand.
I have to use the controller to hold the XB1X and Xbox One together. I have to hold the PS4 to "connect" to the Xbox. I have to hold the PS4 to "start" the Xbox. I have to hold the Xbox to "select" from the in game options, and I have to start the game off from the Xbox. 
I have to hold the controller to "start" the Xbox.

~!~Tell me about your gaming life!

Kickmaster Kim: So I'm planning to get a new TV and have a few questions to ask before I start to talk.
I currently have a PS4 in preparation for Blops 4. I'm thinking about getting the Switch, but I've heard people saying Switch doesn't have CoD WWII yet, so I want to play that.
I currently own The Division, LBP: Division, Far Cry Primal, and The Division 2.
I plan on getting The Division 2 and FC: Wildlands and I want to play those.
I plan to get the Splatoon 2 expansion pass and I'm fairly certain that's where my Switch goes.
I plan to get Forza Horizon 4 and try to finish all the DLCs of the Gears of War 1-4 campaigns.
I plan to get Nioh 2 and try to finish the Demon's Souls expansion.
I plan on playing more than just Forza 7.
I'm also interested in the following:
- Resident Evil 7
- Sekiro
- Metro 2040
- Days Gone
- Days Gone PreOrders
- Dino Crisis 2
- State of Decay 2
- Days Gone
- The Last of Us 2
- and many more.
So what I'm wondering is, what do I need to get into gaming? Is it getting into video game? Is it getting into movies? Is it getting into music? Are there other parts of my life that I value more than video games?
Also, I'm more into being able to get into games than my PS4.

If you don't care about any of the above, don't really. Just watch a few short movies and you'll have a good foundation to learn the rest.

~!~Nintendo president: "Switch is the best platform for gaming"

Phantom Thief: Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa just tweeted this, and I thought it was worth its own thread, because it's something I think a lot of people probably shouldn't be doing, and it's something that I respect a lot about him as a CEO.
I mean, I don't think he's saying the Switch is the best platform for gaming, or that it's the best platform for gaming. He just seems to imply that Nintendo Switch is the best platform for gaming, if we're being strict about what a CEO should say.
First and foremost, I want to emphasize that I'm not supporting Furukawa and Nintendo Switch. That's my understanding.
Second and third thing, I want to emphasize that I don't think there's anything wrong with Furukawa and Nintendo Switch. If we allow him to lead Nintendo Switch, we're allowing the former to be the best platform for developing Japanese developers and western publishers.
Let's get into this a little bit—what do you think it would take to have him lead Nintendo Switch?
-----
Acquiescence: He needs to do better.
-----
Aquamarine: .
-----
Dooble: yeah, he needs to do better
-----
Laserbeam: I prefer him to the current Nintendo president, although I also understand his struggle with the "gamer ear" in general.
-----
Cess007: He needs to be better.
-----
Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I mean i think thats the same as him doing whatever it takes to get a job
-----
Medalion: Oh shit, so just like him? 
He needs to start acting out and having to say things like: I'm EXCITED, I'm EXCITED, I'm GAMING. 
He has said things that we don't think would be in writing, but he is obviously acting on it.
-----
Shugga: Furukawa is a very good CEO.

CaviarMeths: This is a good read.

~!~The Surge 2: Why You Should Play It

Ametroid: A new Surge 2 releasing on Steam in the coming months has me interested in this game. I loved the first one and it's easily my most played Soulsborne game. From what I've played the first one is pretty good. I like the upgrades that you get to use.
However this new one is pretty different which I'm not sure if I like or not.
First thing I'm greeted with is a sense of place. This game takes place in a futuristic setting often not represented in the mainstream FPS genre. You go from a small robot to a huge city and from there you as the player go from a young man to a old woman. I think some of the main differences between this and the first game are as follows:
1) Enemy variety.
This is a big thing that's different than most other FPS. This is a game where you can take on several enemy types at once. Some enemies are downright dangerous. You have to take out one of each of them.
2) Skill trainers. The player has to recruit a skill class and then use that class to your advantage. For example I'll be fighting a trainer who has a charge exclusive Kusoru axe that you can pierce with your pierce skill. You can choose to do that and it won't stun lock you.
3) Not having a build
This game does not have a build option. You can either start as hollow warrior or build up to a strong priestess that can heal you.
4) Difficulty levels
This game is hard as nails but feels pretty fair. You have to manage your damage and you have to think about your builds to deal with each crit. You are going to be able to reach a high level quickly.
5) Difficulty Upgrades
This is another thing that I've notice in this game. I'm impressed with how difficult this game is. You feel you're going to be able to hit enemies in a lot of places but you have to think about what abilities you have to use to deal with it. It does feel a bit weird to me that I can't have a build that doesn't have a build option.
6) Alot of Bosses
This game is hard as nails. It's a shame that it's just not a top 5 res for the Soulsborne games. There's a lot of stuff you can do to be done with
====================
~!~Why does Nintendo treat their games as “second best seller” only when they themselves treat their games as second best sellers?

HypedBeast: I’m not talking about sales numbers or sales based on number of copies sold, I’m talking about metrics that would factor factors into a decision such as how many people bought a game or how many copies sold. 
For example, I’m not talking about separating games by D for example. However, I’m talking about including charts/series in a shopping cart. 
Also, when people say they feel Nintendo treats their games as second best seller they are more talking about how their games sold more than actually selling them. 
So with this, I’m thinking we are in a weird time where we have games like Octopath Traveler getting more and more positive reviews and trailers even though reviews are less important, and things like Splatoon online (which got a positive review from the OT OT OT fanbase) are getting plenty of negative reviews too. 
In my opinion, it seems like a slight shift in how people are thinking overall when it comes to their games and how they interact with others. I guess this is what I’m trying to understand as well.
So Era, what’s your thoughts on this?
-----
mazi: nintendo treats their games as second best sellers if im remember wrong, unless you mean people who bought the games themselves, i'd much rather not have another copy of xenoblade for example.
-----
nsilvias: Its like the witcher 3 got review scores that don't include 100% of the games they've released in the past decade. Its a huge deal. It's how everyone's relationship with their companies is usually good.
-----
Aigis: I agree, and i guess you have me at "cinematic reasons", but you can use really high quality OTs to compare both games, and its impossible to be honest without looking at charts
-----
Memento: It seems like a small shift in how people think
-----
Numberfox: The recent zelda remakes are the first example I see of this.
The Switch is a huge platform for these kinds of games and it makes sense for Nintendo to make some use of those properties if they want to make games with higher engagement.

Aigis: That’

~!~Why did the PS4 Pro start off doing all the bad things I was expecting?

chanunnaki: I've been wondering...
Why is the PS4 Pro so bad that I'm expecting it to be fine?
Why do I have to repeatedly power off the console?
Is the fan causing the issue?
What's the best solution to achieve that?
-----
Aquamarine: .
-----
chanunnaki: I've tried multiple times to power off the PS4 Pro, but never could get past the first few minutes of the game. I did eventually power down, but I always started the game back off, and that was after I had already started the first few hours.
-----
Cronogear: I don’t know why you’d expect the PS4 Pro to be all that bad, but the fan might be doing the right thing. I’ve never had a PS4 Pro refuse power on.

Aquamarine: .

ctfg23: Yeah I guess PS4 Pro is fine.

Knight613: It's just the Pro.

chanunnaki: I actually thought about that too. I guess I’ll have to power down.

~!~Does anyone actually enjoy these games?

Nijhuhk: I’m a parent myself. I tend to watch my kids and my wife weekly to see if they are interested in games.
But yesterday I decided to import Destiny 2 Forsaken.
It sucks, but I also regretted not getting it when it was on sale.
But it was a game I was excited for (Now I regret not getting it, but when it was on clearance for €30 it was a big AAA exclusive)
So I clicked the sale thread and I was instantly hooked.
And yesterday, I downloaded the trial.
And I am on the fence playing it.
I tried to play around with it a bit (I think it was around 2 hours long) but just couldn’t.
The first 10 minutes (I think it took me ~8 hours, I don’t know), I was doing too much, I had to stop playing it because I got bored and I stopped playing after 17 minutes.
Then it started to fall apart (For the life of me)
I tried to push through the first few hours, It’s a serviceable game now and I’m enjoying the story and activities
But I’m not really feeling it.
I just want to play the hell out of it, I’m not sure if I want to finish it or if I’ll just get bored.
There is a certain vibe that it just isn’t for me, It feels like something I should get more than other games in the genre.
So I’m curious to know if others like it, and if I

Cess007: Yes, this. I've been playing for about 10-15 hours a day since I was a kid and I just can't stop. 
It's a fine game, but not great. I'm just not sure what it is I enjoy more.
-----
Deleted member 42686: I dislike it.
I like it for the story and for the gameplay.
However, it just gets worse when you stop playing.
For example, the story and the characters are just insufferable and there is no fun in them.
And if you read the videogame magazines you will often get some weird titles like "Sushi Striker", "Virtua Fighter 6".

I've always been intrigued by the idea of watching movies and anime too much. 
I don't like any of the big picture mode movies or anime, only the ones I love seem interesting.
But recently I've been watching anime and manga more than anything.
I haven't watched the ones I want to watch, and I've watched more anime than manga and anime.
It's been about a year now since I've watched anime, manga, and game.
I'm not sure if you're right about it or not but I'm still around the same age as the general average.

Symphony: Anime, books, movies. I've only recently discovered the appeal of the medium by watching some of the stuff I've read or watched on YouTube.
-----
Igorth: I can't handle watching anime but reading manga, rpgs, etc. and reading novels.
-----
Ploid 6.0: Anime, movies, non of them nowadays. I like the animation, music etc. of the big games. Life is too short now with my 3 job mother and work, I don't have time to waste on a constant 3 hour binge of a movie, a book or a video game.
-----
mrmickfran: I find anime to be an idealistic relic of the past, just like the Manga and Background art of the manga.
I like the story, the characters, and the music.
I like the world.
I like the characters.
I like going into a game and seeing the character face to character.
I like going in a game and playing the game.
I don't mind reading novels and games.
I like anime and reading manga, too.

~!~Bayonetta 3 - Aya from Persona 4 Golden in Bayonetta 3?

Jintor: I was looking into this and thought it was kinda interesting, I've only played Bayonetta 1 and 2 (after 2's really bad translation), and I'm sensitive to Bayo's weird sexualization. So, I played Bayonetta 1 first (preferably in the arc of the Bayo Ultimania with the stylish female lead), and I was kind of shocked to find out that this new character isn't actually from that game.
But, I was mostly surprised by this:
So, with the help of a friend who took me back and released a quick gameplay clip from the first gameplay cutscene, I was able to recreate a Bayonetta 1 (and all other trophies) in Bayonetta 3. However, I was also surprised to see that this new character is not actually from 3, but rather that P4D isn't a thing at all. The animations are more like they're running with a rhythm holding a button for a while, and it's hard to imagine this character actually standing still at the camera.
Now, the thing I dislike about this character is that she's not actually "a guy" at all. All she's done is cover a wide variety of people, I know that's not a real character, but I didn't really see her playing sports or fighters or anything like that. The only real thing I can think of is that there's something about her design that I think is strange.
There's also a "handful of weird" character design decisions. In Bayonetta 1 this is "she's standing there with her Personas and a weird looking dude in a jacket and a pants that nothing actually cut out," and in Bayonetta 3 this is "the character that's standing at the camera with the weird looking dude in a jacket," so maybe this is the strange looking character that you think is there?
I might be an odd person to complain about, but I think what I like most of the time is Bayonetta's design in Bayonetta 1, which is pretty much her own design and not like that in Bayonetta 3. So, what do you think of this? Is this a design problem at all?
-----
KZXcellent: I think it looks fine to me but it does ruin the design of two characters that the game tried

~!~Microsoft’s first party studios working on Sea of Thieves

Theorry: 
-----
bsigg: I wonder how big of a studio it would be if they did all their single player/PVE type games.
-----
SuikerBrood: They've got the tools to do it. They've got Unity devs working on it. 
It's really cool.
-----
Sho_Nuff82: So, who is working on it? I thought it wasn't going to be announced until it was finished.
-----
SuikerBrood: 343 and Studio MDHR.

~!~PSA: Retailers sometimes send you this E-Mail every time you preorder/buy a game

WarpSpeedMolasses: I've been noticing these lately, and it's gotten to the point where I'm noticing I'm ordering more games from more locations.
Example:
I preordered God of War on release day, preordered a new Switch game (no regrets), and a week later got the mail telling me to cancel my order. I took the mail right as I preordered the new AC Odyssey release date, and mailed the game to them.
They played it, and then proceeded to play it and told me I couldn't do this again, and told me to cancel.
*shrug*
I look at the notification, and thought "What the fuck, I'm not going to play it tomorrow."
I look at the mail, and I'm sure this is the mail I'm going to get back.
This isn't the first time this has happened to me. I've been a huge digital giftcard holder, and been anticipating buying games and movies since the DS era, and I just don't have the time to care.
It's just gotten to the point where it's just not worth the time. I am now hesitant to pre-order games, as I don't feel like I'm doing something right.
So, I guess I'm just in the wrong game.
I can't help it, but I'm also in the wrong situation, so I kind of want to complain about it, or at least encourage you to do the same.
If you guys have examples of this, or if it's something you're going to need to consider, feel free to let me know. I may be able to help.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I mean, you didn't pre-order RDR 2, you got it.
I'm sorry.

Grapezard: The mail doesn't work if you don't have the correct address, OP.
-----
X1 Two: Hey, you got the RDR2 mail? If you don't have the address, it will say "last changed order appears today".
I can't help you with this, but I'm sure that if you contact support you will get a response back.

Acquiescence: Part of me thinks they better do it now since they'd more than likely end up dumping the game on Steam and waiting for a sale.
-----
Theorry: Yeah i might have read elsewhere that they better do this.
-----
SuiQuan: I hope they sell it on Steam, I refuse to buy any games on the PS Store, I would rather support a developer that puts their game on Steam but that doesn't mean supporting Sony's storefront.
-----
Deejay1994: I should have read properly and reported to them that I reported to the company so they'd know lol.
-----
~Fake: I can't wait. Hoping for some kind of ps+ discount.
-----
Toumari: I'm down for this. Hope it's cheap enough to give them confidence to do something with the IP.
-----
Kureransu: I'm buying it day one, I played it when it came out.
I don't think it's worth buying day 1 at this point, just wait a while.
-----
marzoo: I still want to play this game. It looks beautiful and the world is ripe for exploration
-----
DeejayDish: I hope this game is good. It’s a shame it’s Switch exclusive.

~!~Fortnite Switch vs PS4: Which is the best Switch experience?

Robinson: I'm looking to pick up a Switch when I'm in town for my trip. I already have a Switch and PS4.
Which one is better to get?
Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not asking to play Fortnite on Switch, I'm asking if it's the best experience to play Fortnite Switch on a handheld console.
-----
Seedy87: It has to be PS4, since the Switch version is pretty much identical to PS4 in terms of framerate and resolution.
It's not a port of the PS4 version.
-----
Cess007: The one that I can remember definitively. It's the one that plays best and is the best experience I've had on a console in general (in fact, I consider myself pretty good on this one)
-----
DanteLinkX: I have a switch but it's not the best version imo. More like the ps1 version of the game.
-----
Zerokoolpsx: PS4 is my favorite version.
-----
Cess007: You can go PS4 and play it on Switch, which is not a bad thing. The port is a lot of fun.
-----
Xavi: PS4 version is the best version.
-----
Aokiji: Definitely go PS4. It’s the best version.
-----
TheBaldwin: I just picked up a switch this week.
Need to pick it up again, since i sold my switch some time ago.
-----
Robinson: It's my favorite version.
The PS4 version has some framerate issues and the frame rate makes it look like it's a PS2 game and not a PS3 game.
The Switch version has better controls and it's way more impressive.

~!~What's the best Pokemon game?

Vanillalite: Alright Era and let's start it off with a question.
What is the best Pokemon game? Probably a hard call but I vote for it.
I've been craving watching some Pokemon remakes for ages now. My first experience with the series was the original Red/Blue. I didn't know what that was. I remember the first time I saw the Pokemon outside of water in the wild. It was awesome!
-----
Herne: Black/White, probably.
-----
CormoranStrike: The one with the
Spoiler
Series is known for great series.
-----
Zalman: A remake

-----
Seda: Black/White

Phantom Thief: I vote Red/Blue.

Vanillalite: I don't know I guess.

====================
~!~What's the best way to play Final Fantasy games on the PS2?

Xavi: Hey everyone,
I was looking for a way to get into the series and the PS2 is being held up as a great place to start.
I've been following the series since the release of VII and I absolutely loved every moment of it. I thought I'd start with FF9. It seems like a good fit. I've heard a lot of people say that it doesn't seem like much of a lot of focus is on the story and that it's way too confusing/difficult to follow.
The first time I played, I was excited to see how the game would be played on the PS2. I would have to admit that I did enjoy FFX but I was vastly over-exercising when it came to the characters and story. It's probably not that I was super interested but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have REAL interest in FFX.
So I'm looking for a way to play it. My best bet would definitely be to just beat it, but I'm not sure if I have the patience to do that. So far I've been able to get through the first act of the game with just a few runs. I'm just overwhelmed by the amount of stuff going on and I don't know if I'm really "getting" deep into it or if I just want to see the story and feel like I'm progressing. I've heard it can be a bit frustrating with grinding but I've never had a problem with it.
I think that's my plan in this thread. I'm not looking for a "proper guide" lol. I want to understand the game and go about my quests properly.
I've heard people say "less story" but I'm not looking for a "proper guide" lol. I want to get to the meat of the game.
I've heard people say that they recommend playing on hard mode for the first time. Is that wrong?
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
-----
OrbitalBeard: You're going to get frustrated a bit, so you'll have to look elsewhere for advice.
For FF1, you can always go back and listen for "rumor." Just playing the game normally gives you the impression that the story and characters are being very serious.
For FF2, if you want

~!~What are your favorite light gun games?

Krejlooc: Hi era,
I'm into light gun games, but I'm always hesitant to commit myself to a proper playthrough of a shooter as light as MGS, Twin Snakes, etc.
I'm currently in the process of trying to decide on a good light gun game. I feel like this is the best game I've ever played, with things like Gunslinger from the first game, and that whole Concept of managing your laser cannon and cooldown.
I'm in the mood for a shooter I can just casually shoot through with some fun bullet hell moments.
Here's my vote for my favorite light gun games.
-----
Richter1887: I think the best shooter in the genre is Gunman.
It is so intense and satisfying.
-----
MetalBoi: Shoot 'em Up!
-----
NIN90: Every single one of those, yes.
-----
Silky: I was going to mention the OG XBLA game, but nope, I want a sequel
-----
HockeyGuy412: My favorite
-----
hydruxo: That's a really great list, I love both the light gun games like Gunman and the shmups like Gunman 4. I think the only ones I've played were MGS and Star Wars.

~!~The Outer Worlds: What's Next?

Sillegamer: A new trailer popped up showing off The Outer Worlds, one of my favorite immersive sims this gen. 
I dont think it's a trailer, but a video that came up during E3 last year. 
Really excited for this game.
-----
Mass_Pincup: The beginning of the game looks amazing. 
Just not a multiplayer game, but I wonder if we'll see a follow up DLC.
-----
Slayven: Now that the Outer Worlds is coming out I really want this to be good
-----
The era of Luigi: I can only hope.
-----
Treestump: I just want it to be good. I have reservations about the game, but I also know that if it does well enough, it will surpass other games in this genre. I hope it comes out in November.
-----
Slayven: I am pretty excited about the game
-----
Oreiller: It's shaping to be the best game of 2018. It's totally my cup of tea and I don't see myself dropping another 3-4 months of support at the end of the current one.
-----
Pottuvoi: I hope it succeeds.

~!~The Long Game: What would you like to be included in a PlayStation Classic?

HussiZooT: I'm currently working through my teens to adulthood. Having a lot of free time now isn't doing me good to be included in a console with a ton of unique things. So, what about the rest!? 
I'm talking about games that have a lot of unique things that you can't usually find in a console that was already in development. I know that on the 360 there was Mortal Kombat, Tekken 3, and Soulcalibur 2, but those were all released on the OG PSN. I know there is a Classic collection on PS4. I know that the old games for these games can be bought digitally, but those are not 360 games. Why would you want a 360 version of a game with dlc?
I'm talking about games that are included in the PS Classic and are available for purchase on the PS Store.
From what I understand, you could just use the disc, which is the only way to access the games.
I would love to just buy the product on PS4 and get a Ps5 version.
What about you? Would you like to be included in a Ps4 version?
Do you have any console games you would like to include in a Ps4 version in addition to the ps5?
-----
Iyagovos: I love my Ps4, but I have a few games I’d love to play that I’m waiting on playing. I’d just buy it on PS4 and play them.
-----
Dr. Caroll: An Xbox Classic. It's the only way we can get a console version of The Next Level.
-----
Iyagovos: What exactly would you use the Ps5 for?
-----
Igorth: I wish I had a ps4.
-----
Kerozinn: Ps classic, but i got the ps5 for 3 however it is very unlikely the ps5 will be able to run the ps4 version of Tekken 7. 
You can use the ps4 to play 2 ps2 Ps1 to games, 1 ps2 Ps4 and Ps4 to games, ps2 Ps2 to games, ps3 Ps4 to games, Ps4 Ps to games, Ps5
-----
Iyagovos: That's a little much

~!~Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution announced (iOS, Android, Switch, PS4, PS Vita)

Forkball: After several delays, Nintendo has finally announced their Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution for iOS and Android.
Publisher is Nintendo.
Developer: Imagine Nintendo
Developer: Nintendo
---------------------------------
Some info:
The game is a collaboration between Nintendo and Square Enix. The player control seven characters with unique movesets. In Duelists, each character has two Attack, Special, and Evolutionations. Attack is used to protect the weak cards. Special cards are created by the player. If the climax of the game results from a CARD based game, then the characters can become free.
---------------------------------
The game will have eight characters, and contains a brand-new dueling system. The system is divided into two campaigns: Duelist One and Duelist Two. These are a standalone story, with a brand-new villain named Yugioh. Duelist One is a high-level player, while Duelist Two is the high-level player that can summon demons to fight for him.
Some info:
-----
Noppie: Oh nice, I can finally play this.
-----
Firima: I've had this game for a few years, I was going to buy it on Switch at launch and I didn't really like it, but after hearing all the complaints about it, I decided to get it on Switch. Liking the music and the characters a whole lot.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Wait, it's a Switch game?
-----
Firima: The art style is kind of hideous to me, I always see the point with it.
-----
TheMisterManGuy: The only thing I hated about the Link franchise was the "you don't lose, you only lose" stage. It's not the worst, but I don't really like it.
-----
Aquamarine: .
-----
Hexa: It's not a Switch game.
I see it more as a console version of Pokemon.
I have a feeling we'll get a Switch version of XY and ORAS soon, so that'll be nice.
-----
FiXalaS: Yes please!
I have my fingers crossed for a Link's Awakening 2, or even Link's Awakening HD

~!~The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - "The Legend of Zelda series"

ttontoon: I think we have yet to see a mainline Zelda game.
I think we are now close to a release date - maybe a couple of months after Ocarina of Time which is when the big news begins.
I don't think it will be too long though, but I think it will be a few years between now and when they bring the Majora's Mask Remake.
I think they will be working on the multiplayer part of the game, maybe later in development.
-----
Cartridge Games: Usually Nintendo takes ages to make a new IP, if its not already completed they probably will commission a new one.
Feels like a slow burn to invest time in it.
Hope it turns out well
-----
John Dunbar: it's not a slow burn. a few years is a medium pace, if not multiple projects per year. if its a game that can handle a few projects in a year, then the right move.
-----
DongBeetle: It will be a few years between now and release. BotW was one of them.
-----
Knight613: It could turn out to be a good one.
-----
Renna Hazel: It's probably a bit too long to be a slow burn, but sure. I'm sure it'll be worth it.
-----
StuBurns: They're probably still in development. I think we'll see one or two mainline Zelda games at least in the first half of the generation.
-----
Lord Azrael: The big announcement that is making the most impression on me is when they announced Pikmin 4. I think it's going to be the first mainline Pikmin as is.
-----
Mediking: I'm in the process of writing a book. I really like reading.
-----
Jraphics Horse: I hope we'll see more mainline Pikmin games for as long as we are around.

-----
Phantom Thief: I'm not sure this is a good video, but I got to admit I thought the same thing.
-----
Theorry: Yeah. The new Harry Potter game was announced and we still didnt got it. The new Spiderman game was announced last month and no one seems to talk about it. So I'm saying Sony exclusives are the best before all.
-----

====================
~!~What are you favorite games of old?

Jintor: Personally, it just feels like a good time to make this thread, as we're in the midst of a fantastic generation about video games and it's about to hit a new level.
We're in a world where almost every kid's imagination is running wild with their imagination of things and we're constantly finding new ideas and ways to enjoy the games. 
The thing with the most iconic examples of this is that we have games that have daredevil crossed the line and they are just as crazy as most of us could have imagined them to be.
Pokemon Yellow is a great example of this as it has the most interesting gimmick of all the games and the best design of any of the games.
What are your favorite games, as they can be quite "serious" games or ones that focus a lot on the personality rather than the toys aspect. 
I'd also like to hear what you guys classify as your favorite and least favorite games of old.
-----
Platy: I never understood why Knack did not top the list. It is not a game but a toy, the toy has no personality and is a terrible game.
One of the best games in my opinion because of the power boost gimmick.
-----
Tribal24: I've come to dislike a lot of games that focus too much on "marring" children. You are not alone. Kids should not feel connection to them. I think it's important to not make games that are about children or about violence. That's not to say it shouldn't be fun, but it shouldn't try to be it. The best game that I played as a kid was a game about a kid trying to get into a relationship with a girl he met on the bus. It's a good idea, but it shouldn't be trying to reconcile the fact that the relationship between the game and the girl is something I think is important humanly possible.
-----
Sailent: It's a terrible cartoon.
-----
Zhukov: There's something that makes me think "Why not just play something else."
-----
ScreamingMadden: No, it's because you need a reason to play video games.
-----
FluxWaveZ: Pretty much what I'm trying to say.
-----
Syril: I'd be okay with games with violence that aren't

Danzflor: In for the open beta. Hope it's as good as the first game looked, with some more details and quests, hopefully.
-----
IbizaPocholo: Open beta starts tomorrow, 28.4 Euros except on Thursday, 14.9 Euros.
-----
Mórríoghain: No, that is the problem with me. I have played for nearly a year already, I can't believe that Ubisoft has abandoned the beta, and the servers are already having problems. I am not really interested in the game, because I don't have money to play, but I really do not want to wait for open beta.

~!~What if the PS5 supports voice over internet for all games?

butman: Something something.
I was thinking about this when I was playing God of War with the voice over from the other platforms yesterday.
The game is not graphically beautiful but the audio quality is impressive.
I thought to myself, how fun would it be to have a session where I can listen to the game audio and then play it?
I know that the fact that i could experience its voice over functionality is a dream come true but what if the PS5 supports voice over internet for all games too?
Would you pay a premium for this?
-----
Knight613: Pricing? Doubt it.
-----
Hamster Plugin: If PS5 is backwards compatible with all PS4 games, yes.
-----
darkside: also of course it's gonna support voice over internet
-----
Ichi: I bet it would
-----
DesmaX: You're not wrong. It's gonna be for all games, including backwards compatible games
-----
TheJollyCorner: No?
-----
Hamster Plugin: Yes.
In a lot of situations that can't be true, yes it could. Especially with older titles.
-----
Chris.: Not without a caveats though.
Theres only one way it could work.

I have Steam preorder on "Premier Launcher" for PC and PS4 and a total of "Standard" for PS4. I cannot pre-order on Steam because it will refuse to give me the correct information.
It's very annoying when you need to use super quick to get past certain topics.

Hektor: Doesn't even need an Steam account

Staf: Yeah, i can't use super quick. I've already pre-ordered and I've bought two games from Steam and they were OK.

Minsc: I've been looking into how to use it as well, so that's a solution.
I found this video on youtube
Basically, you can just go to the "product quantity" part of the Steam search and enter the preorder quantity , which you can then click to use.

Vipu: Yes, it does get you a "special" preorder when it's confirmed.

Iichter: It's not a feature, it's a feature
