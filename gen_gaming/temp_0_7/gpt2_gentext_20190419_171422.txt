~!~Why do people like the way Square Enix's games are?

Phediuk: The thread title is pretty self explanatory.
Square Enix is known for excellent series like Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Tactics, and Final Fantasy V, but a new entry in this series is nothing like FFXV, FFVI, or FFXV.
Square Enix's games are... something else.
-----
Stopdoor: Their recent publishing of smaller scale IPs isn't really their best. They don't really have anything new to show.
-----
Cartridge Games: FF7 remake, probably
-----
Zukkoyaki: They're not really trying to be the best in their series. They just like doing something different and I think they'd rather they stick with FFXIV than go back to FFXVI.
-----
Puffy: It's not their best in the FF series.
-----
The Last One: I've never heard of FFXV, its not my thing.
-----
BlueBomberX: I like the way Japanese developers choose and I like them.
-----
Kyoufu: They like experimentation and they like Square Enix.
-----
CaviarMeths: I like them, but why the big boys? FFXV, FFXV Remake, and FFVII Remake are the only ones I're even planning to play. That's pretty much it.
-----
s y: I like them but I don't really like them.

~!~I want to play Pokemon

Dazraell: I had the impression from the first trailer that my hype was real and I was excited. But I don't have the patience, I don't trust them, I don't like how the competitive is working and I like that I only care about Pokemon. But I know I'm not the only one thinking that game will be 2019 and I know it's a simulation game, but I still don't know what I want. I don't feel like I'm a Pokemon expert when I see that the casuals will just need to learn the basics and be doing battle better. I know I won't be the Pokemon expert, I know I'll be a chipper newbie. I also don't feel like I'm a master of world and I've gone through the whole tutorial series on Twitch. I know I'll be the Pokemon expert, I know I'll have fun. If I'm not the expert, it's because I have to give an example on how to catch Pokémon.
So what about you?
-----
ILikeFeet: you're not completely mistaken.
(I'm also not even a trainer, I just play with the kids at my main house)
-----
MouldyK: It kind of just makes sense. 
I mean, if the game is more of a traditional RPG or one with more open levels like the first, it can't really be received like other RPGs for starters.
-----
Xavi: The Pokemon are the worst in the group (luckily).
-----
kvetcha: I'm glad that the Pokemon are fun to play. The risk of dying is much lower than other RPGs.
-----
Professor Beef: I think it's too easy to just jump in and out of every match.
-----
silkysmooth: Hated the group in the first place. I want to play with the kids but hate the gym leaders.
-----
LavaBadger: I'm not even a Pokemon expert. I just know that I can catch better Pokemon.
-----
The perfect Dark: The Pokemon are the worst.
-----
LewieP: I don't know if I'm overly excited for it, but I am. I want a good Pokemon game.

~!~Darksiders 3 Was Released 5 Years Ago Today

mogster7777: Remember this game?
Darksiders Warmastered Edition was released five years ago today. I was playing it at the time and man it was fantastic. It felt like playing a fully 3D game. I even got a promotion in it. Such a great game and I wish I could have gone back and played it with the PS4 pro enhancement. The lightning combat was incredible. It was one of the first games where I would jump back into a game when upgrading all the way.
This game was really great. I also played the demo of the 3rd game playing as Draven. I just got to the end and thought it was pretty good. I ended up selling the game cause I found it to be an unfinished game.
Anyway. I remember being so disappointed in the game and having to leave. I have never played a game like this and after that I never even finished it. I just went and sold it.
I really don't want to say this because I was playing it for the first time at PSX 2008 and I really enjoyed that game. I still think it is one of the best RPGs of this gen.
I remember thinking how awesome it looked and how beautiful it looked and it looked really nice. It even had the soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu so man I'm really proud of that. I also remember thinking how much fun I had in this game and I'm really looking forward to playing it again because I never played the original version. I know it's pretty difficult but I hope I can do it again.
I think it's time to give it another shot.

Phantom Thief: SOURCE
This is kind of the first and only chance I have at ever seeing any kind of decent Nintendo Switch image in a Nintendo artwork. I am not saying they will be horrible, but it is kind of the first and only chance I have at most.
-----
vestan: nintendo art isn't that bad
-----
Parvaati: Yeah they need to tone down the racist stereotyping that pops into their games. I haven’t bought the game because of it.
-----
jred250: I really hope the next Smash game is a Pokémon game.

rude: I’m sure they’ll see a lot of backlash because it’s an early Punch Out screenshot. And then there’ll be backlash because they’ve been at it for a century.

Dardan Sandiego: I wonder what they'll actually use this game for.

So he had a cool moveset but when he cross jumpred his head in a fucking air guitar and a guitar song nothing came out of it for me.
I was like what the fuck?
Edit: You know? 
I beat the guy with his air guitar.

Squiddo ᔦꙬᔨ: I kinda wish I can do that with some other character I can use.

I just need to add that SMT is a popular franchise and popular with fans, so I don't think I could handle the topic.

Dorfdad: Got an offer to buy for £7.99 and I'm not sure what to choose from the selection so I'm looking for a sim to get into and also have a try at current gen games. 
I'm looking for most simulation games to play but also stuff that has some kind of flair that is a bit different to my usual style (RTS, platformer, etc.) so please don't be overly hard on me. 
I've heard that Simmers is a thing and has a sim tower mode so I'll be following that up with Assetto Corsa and now I'm thinking of buying NoClip 2.

~!~Nintendo Switch & retro consoles

Jintor: So, I'm planning to get a Switch and have it ready for when I get home tomorrow, and I'm wondering what is the best deal to get my hands on retro consoles.
I know most of these are on sale right now, but I'm just curious as to which one to get, and if it's worth the money? Is there any good list of good retro-cons?
I've got a DSi-clone, a GG, Wii-U Pro, a SNES Classic and a Switch.
-----
Cybersai: I keep all my old consoles in boxes with CRT filters.
-----
Xavi: I have all my consoles hooked up with CRT.
-----
Zalman: GameCube and Wii.
I wouldn't worry about the ones on sale right now. There are tons of great retro-cons online.
-----
Roldan: I've got a bunch, but I use it for storing.
-----
Zedark: I only have a Switch, a Wii U and a Retro Dock. Although I did buy a Switch just recently, I only have the Dock to put all my retro-cons in.
-----
G_Shumi: Probably just the Retro-3D Switch that will do you well enough. I've got a Wii U and a Retro Dock and a few other accessories too.
-----
Xavi: I have all my Switch's.
-----
Mr. Phellps: I have a Wii U and a Retro Dock. I also got a lot of games like RE2, Mario and Zelda.
-----
Cybersai: I'm thinking about buying a Wii U but I'm not sure if that's going to last.

~!~Mass Effect 3 Has Some Disappointing Consistent Hit-Scares

Bobo Dakes: So with Mass Effect 3 coming out in less than a week, I thought we should make a thread about why I think the game is a disappointment.
I'm largely a fan of the series - it was one of my favorite games of last gen, and I prefer this type of sci-fi settings. But I was disappointed by the conclusion. It's a big departure from the first three, which I feel was some of the biggest letdowns in the series. I felt it didn't stick to the traditional trilogy tropes, and I didn't enjoy the open-world. I felt it was an incomplete and rushed ending. I did enjoy the game though.
I feel the writing for these characters was pretty stellar. Ashley is a fun character with a cool backstory and is easily the best main character. Meanwhile, Darrius, the ME Rider, is just a blank slate who hasn't been in a video game since the original trilogy. He's just no more than that. He's a character that comes from a series you don't really follow, and he has no story arc that makes more sense, and he's way too flimsy for that. I was disappointed with that, and I don't blame you for that, because I was trying to be optimistic about him. I thought the game's rushed direction would help make it more appealing to me, but it just didn't.
It's kind of a shame, because I think the main plot of Mass Effect 1 and 2 is great. It's a great game, and I hope they do a lot more work in that regard. The ending to 3 was also pretty well done, and the ending to the first was also a great one. It could've done it more, and I'm not sure they could've pulled it off without Supermassive.
-----
Ahasverus: This is the thread we're all waiting for.
People bought into hype and got disappointed.
The only thing redeeming about that game was the ending.
-----
Vincent Grayson: I hope you're all ready to return to it at some point.
-----
Clusterdreams: Can’t see how it will ever return to its roots
-----
Bhonar: I don't think you'll ever hear people say it's a disappointment
It's a masterpiece and I'd love to

~!~Back to school: Why is it so hard to go back to your old school friends?

Masterspeed: I know it's a bit of an older question, but I feel like I've been out of the game for so long because I've lost all the good relationships that I used to have with my old ass peer.
And of course, back in the day I still thought we had a good town in this world and people still talking.
Back in the day I thought the internet was the best, but now I feel like it's just not the case.
I'm glad I went back to school because I'm all in on VR!
What's your school like?
And yes, social interactions in VR is great, but it's kind of a backtrack to backstab in a game.
-----
DocSeuss: It's like a game, it's not like a movie, it's not like a book, it's not like a series. It's all about connections.
It's a cultural phenomenon, but it's also a popular thing.
-----
Cybersai: Classroom 76 in some types of games. I've been in like 8 different times (all level-based, competitive, whatever) and I've only gotten 1 real friend. I know that's just the reality of it, but I'm not sure it's the same.
-----
Lyrick: I miss my time in the UK back in the day, I think even now the majority of my friends don't even live in England.
-----
LewieP: I've been in like 8 different pairs of weights and was always regularly bullied and ridiculed in school.
I've always regretted leaving the old school in the past because I couldn't really mesh with the environment.
-----
Masterspeed: I was a member of the now defunct Board of Film and TV Filmmakers, I used to quite like it. 
I still find it kind of silly that I'm still in this place, but they changed it from a few years ago.
-----
Kept alive forever: I used to live in the UK and here in the US but I think the biggest thing was just socialising and internet was my social circle and I used to spend a lot of time in games and VR. I used to play Fortnite in the UK and play games at 1080p/60FPS/4

~!~I've decided to stop playing Divinity OS 1 and 2 because of the way the story is.

astro: I played 1-2 for a few hours and then decided to turn off the external save since I really don't want to pick up the accessory since I already have the game on Steam.
After a pretty long tutorial segment, I finally unlocked the way the game plays. At first I thought this was the game I'd see the most on Steam, but I'm now seeing people's personal lists of the first two.
The first one is a remake of the first game with a new main character, companions, and dungeon. The new content is not really different from the base game. The dungeon is more like a work place with all the puzzles, side quests, and collectibles in it.
The story is interesting, and I like that it also has a first person perspective. It's all pretty much right, but also a lot of freedom. The combat is simple, but so far it's not that difficult. I'm nearing the end now, and I have to admit I was pretty bored with it.
But I'm not finished yet, so I don't know what the heck awaits...
Spoiler
So...I've decided to turn the game off.
I have a very high tolerance for jank. I have already spent a few hours in this game. I have not been in danger. I have not been running in caters or enemies. I have not been attacked. I have not been hit. I have not felt my health drop drop to zero. The game has been replaying the cutscenes of these two games to raise my health to the highest possible level, so I decided to play it very cautiously.
This has been a long journey. I cannot at all recommend this game to anyone. I've played it for hundreds of hours. I have read every quest in the game on the wiki and I have been following the lore. I have followed the plot. I have watched the cutscenes of the game on youtube. I have seen the screenshots. I have seen the trailers. I have seen the forum posts. I have watched the fan art. I have watched people defending their decision to play this game. I have played the game for a while and have been debating until I'm done. I have beaten the game.
I am not sure if I can handle the jankiness. I am not sure

~!~"Uncharted 4 is the best game ever made"

Dartastic: I just watched this video, and I gotta say, I'm not a huge fan of Uncharted 4. I'm not even a huge fan of Uncharted 2, but this video is pretty good. I love how they have the Nate and Elena feel, and the relationship between them. It feels like they nailed the chemistry for the entire adventure. The first time I saw Drake, I immediately thought "wow. I can't believe this relationship is this close to the one between Nate and Elena." I love the relationship in between them and the how they work together. I just love how "elena and Barry" is "Eddy" and "Kase." The way they bond when they get to the train, and work together to prevent a car chalice. The way they act in a lot of situations, and how they pull each other off. They nail the chemistry for this adventure so well, and I can't believe it's been given so much time and yet they still manage to make this work.
And the part of Nadine that I legitimately do love, is her "hand in hand" movement. She's able to carry lots of things, and she can even hold a rifle. And that's just the first part. The second part of Nadine, she's actually able to carry the train and all the things in the train, and she can actually carry the food conveyors on the train. And when you are taking off the conveyors, she can even carry the pizza box several blocks away, which makes it feel like your are taking off the pizzerules on the conveyors. And when you stop the train, she just stops and you can press the pause button again. It's just so seamless. The whole thing is just so seamless.
I feel like I'm really missing something in Uncharted 4. I feel like it's somehow underappreciated. I miss the pump action in the chapter 2 trailer. I miss the guns. I miss the sneaking. I miss the sniping. I miss the climbing. I miss the running. I miss the long hallways. I just feel like I'm missing a lot, and this game is looking to fix that.

Svart: Haha, just watched this. What a good video. :)
I agree, but, as a whole, ND are on a roll

~!~"The most fun you get in Fortnite" - From Veterans of FPS and Team Racing Games (Cory)

jett: Fascinating video.
-----
Mazzle: The most fun I've had in a FPS was when I was a team in Halo 5.
I'm sick of the practice shooter.
-----
Dreamboum: Halo 5 was a big reason why I wanted to play CS:GO. The level of fragility really made the game interesting to me.
-----
Advance.Wars.Sonic: I think for all of us 90's kids, we grew up on that era, it was really a time where everything was so much better. A lot of the new Team Racing games we played were still some of the most fun we had with our life. We even went to the ice rink several times a week and it was just pure chaos. We even threw parties like MAGFest at young us and it was always so much better than any other time we were playing MAG (and I'm one of the people who could not or did not play it)
The most fun we had in that era was a vs us tournament in TMNT 64, where we had a lot of fun competing against each other for a while.
I think it’s a great video and a good reminder to us all to stay away from Team Racing games.
-----
Dreamboum: I was talking with my cousins about CS:GO two weeks ago and one of my favourite things was to try to make a video about it. He had done that for ages.
He's now doing the same thing just for fun.

~!~RTTP: Fallout 4.

Cincaid: With the news of Red Ash and the surrounding DLC coming to Fallout 76, I've been hankering for some Fallout-style LTTPs. I've already played through every mainline Fallout game and the Dunwich Project, and while I think that's mostly fair, there are a few highlights:
The Following Game:
Red Ash - This is a more in-depth and in depth version of the main plot, but it does offer you an idea of what to expect from the rest of the game. You will be given a set of skill trees to choose from, and it's pretty much the same as the main game, except you won't be able to change the gang quests as they all refer to different points of view and you'll be randomly assigned to them at random.
The Exorcist - This is a horror-themed retelling of the famous Wizardry section of the game, but in a much earlier and more detailed incarnation. It's a short section that covers the first half of the game, and at points is quite long. It's worth checking out, though.
The Sleeping Beauty - Exploring the Sleeping Beauty, and also expanding the town. It's a very good way to clear out a lot of your exposition on the way to the main town, and to clear some exposition on your character before heading back to the main town.
The rest of the game is incredibly easy, though nothing that I found really difficult. The Talos first chapter is really good, but there's nothing really too difficult to do in it. You can usually just clear the text on your first go, though.
And then I'll move on to Fallout 76!
I want to preface this by saying that I've been playing this series for over 20 years now, and it's a blast! But, I'm not a big fan of story heavy RPGs, and I've tried many times to get into them, and I'm not one to be told what's going to happen in the plot of games. So, this is my first thread, but I wanted to provide some advice.
In the main plot, you play as a normal male with the usual Prophet tattoo on both hands. At points during your adventure you are given quests to do, in which you meet other characters. This is where the gameplay is the main attraction.
In the side quests, you are presented with

~!~Super Meat Boy Forever coming to Switch

NotLiquid: It was announced a while back that the sequel to the long-running series, Super Meat Boy Forever, would hit Switch soon, and to be precise, we haven't seen anything about it since.
Now, a few weeks ago, Meat Boy Twitter have started teasing a press conference they will do in Japan (sequel to the FES) in order to bring the franchise back back back in the spotlight. This could very well be the trailer for the announcement that finally confirms their intention on bringing the original game to Switch.
First off, you won't find any hints that this is a Wii U port, nor any news about the emulation on Wii U level. That said, let's just assume that it's not a port of the first one as we all know that the Wii U got a similar treatment when it launched.
As for the announcement of the announcement, expect it when it happens. We already knew that it was for the Switch. There's also a leak that confirms the Arcade Mode was already ported to Switch, and it's for the Switch.
You won't see a trailer until April, and I don't expect any surprise announcement until then.
-----
Cess007: It's coming soon. The first trailer for the game was a teaser for the second game.
-----
NotLiquid: I don't think it's a port by any means. There's more than a few stages included, but the game itself is a new game and it's also being published by Bandai Namco.
-----
ReyVGM: It's a Wii U game, right?
-----
Cartridge Games: It’s not coming to Switch and I think it’s not releasing on there.
It’s coming to PS4, Xbone, and PC in the future

I think we all know Nintendo has a great track record this time around, and I think they would have been able to have gotten the most laughter and comments possible with that SNES presentation. I also hear people say "E3 is E3" a lot, and I think that's a fair complaint, but I'm curious to hear some of your thoughts on that.
-----
Phendrift: I feel like it’d have been much better if they had some of the Fire Emblem and other Nintendo characters show up, but I believe the presentation was all sorts of underwhelming.
-----
KZXcellent: They did a great job. Smash and Pokemon were the biggest highlights for the launch.
-----
Robinson: I think Nintendo's E3 presentation is still very good.
-----
Denman: I’d say no.
They did so many cool things with the presentation, but I think they went overboard.
-----
Zalman: I think they nailed it. They had a lot of great characters and a great game.
-----
Kaz Mk II: I think they would have been able to do more, but I think the presentation was a huge step up.
-----
Revali: Nintendo Directs are usually very bland and predictable.
Also, I think they should have gotten the Smash Bros game, but it was probably better that way.
-----
KtotheRoc: I would have enjoyed them more if they had the Smash Bros game.

~!~Omar310: The Verge’s Steven Messages Play Store Recommendations

melodiousmowl: Not sure if this has been posted yet, but I found this article to be very informative and in some ways informative. 
Steven Messages is a Canadian YouTuber who has done a lot of quality videos on the topic and I personally found the video to be informative, and he also recently started his channel in a very positive way. 
He is the main YouTuber on the O2 and the first youTuber on the channel to have an official video show on the channel, and he is also the first youTuber to recommend a book to friends on Amazon (he doesn’t use Kindle). 
I decided to make a thread talking about suggestions for books on a channel I’ve personally been a big fan of, so I thought this would be a good thread to share. 
I personally like what he has to say, and I think that he does a good job of summarizing some of the points he makes in the article. 
It’s a very good read, and I think the fact that he is a YouTuber is something to see. 
I’m also interested in what he has to say about game recommendations based on the recommendations in the article. 
Much appreciated.
-----
Cartridge Games: I’m not aware of the type of games he’s talking about. I think he’s aware that the biggest problem with recommendation of books is “simplicity”
I think the main problem is that the best publishers don’t sell books these days.
But he’s right in that publishers are avoiding books because they make them easier.
I’m a fan of games but I’m slightly surprised he’s this positive on Switch.
-----
Theswweet: I feel like if anything said, this article would've raised the minimum possible hourly rate at my place significantly for my fellow Canadians.
-----
Poutine Runner 2049: Y’all are gonna love this.
-----
melodiousmowl: I know, it's just game recommendations I would've considered picking up, but I know so many games on a channel that are all I really need in the world.

Sophia: I like the video and it

~!~Doesn't EVE Online need a Battle Royale mode?

Parenegade: I know I'm in the minority on this one. This is something I've felt about MMOs for a while. The lack of BR has made it difficult for me to sink in 60 hours into a single player version of this game. Many people (me included) feel the lack of BR is part of making this game too good. I understand this is a side effect of not having a dedicated BR mode, but it does feel like these complaints are being made by those who want a more epic experience.
I still remember when I tried to play WoW with a friend and we made big improvements to the core gameplay. We went from a game that was fun to a game that was a lot of fun to a game that had a lot of issues. We both hated that we didn't get a large pool of people to join. That shit put life back into games like Guild Wars 2.
Now I'm not sure if I should jump to a different theory but I feel like EVE Online needs a BR mode. Especially with how popular BR is. I've been playing for a few years and it hasn't been very fun. I feel like a BR mode could really help bring people together, something like Rainbow Six Siege, would work. But it needs to be something serious. Something that doesn't just have a high barrier of entry, but also a barrier of entry into the BR scene, which is why I feel it's so vital to get this game on the right track.

~!~Forza 7: Microsoft has a new Forza game on the way (Get it?)

Ge0force: As the title says, Forza 7 and Playground Games are working on a new Forza game for PC. It's not ready yet, but they said there's a lot of stuff to work on at Microsoft's stage (Read OP).
-----
Maintenance: Honestly I'll wait for the PC version.
-----
Windu: This thread is gonna turn out pretty terrible then.
-----
nogoodnamesleft: How is this game?
-----
Trekkie: This game is p good
-----
Windu: Really? I thought the first game was PGR 4.
-----
HotsauceDragon: Is this the first Forza game to make you play with the controller instead of your thumbstick?
-----
shaneo632: Is there a moment where I'm excited when I see a game like Forza 7, FH or Quantum Break
-----
JigglesBunny: I’m not going to be excited about it because it’s p good but I can’t wait to play it.
-----
Berserking-Guts: What? This is the first Forza game that involves the disc drive?
-----

====================
~!~So I just bought an Xbox One X - what should I play?

MrH: Just wanted to get some feedback. I have a PS4 and a Switch. I've got a few important things I'd like to know before spending the money:
1) I don't know how cloud saves work.
2) I don't have a PS+ subscription. I don't want to play with friends online.
3) My backlog is already massive, any recommendations?
-----
carlosrox: Play some good games and then forget about worrying about all the other things and go play some good games.
If you don't have a 1X or game that plays well on the One do you have a 4k TV?
-----
Kyoufu: Get a PC, then forget about all the PC stuff and play some good games you missed out on before.
-----
Theorry: Play some good games. Then forget about everything else.
-----
Theswweet: Play some good games. I've been itching to play something and I had a good idea of what to play.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Play some good games and then forget about everything else.
-----
aisback: I’ve got a PS4 and a Switch. I know I’d be a little more inclined to play some ps exclusive games
-----
Lukas Taves: I'm a 2XQB guy but Ive been playing a lot of Lumines and Hollow Knight, and Hollow Knight had a ton of replay-ability recently. I just wanna play some games I missed the first time around.
-----
Bumhead: I used to play a lot of PC stuff, but I haven't had the space to actually do any gaming for a long time.
-----
GUNDAM STARDUST: Play some good games that you maybe interested in. The Xbox oOlarization is disgusting.

====================
~!~Sony is sending out PS Now codes to people who downloaded a PS3 copy of GT Sport or PD: Top Gear VR

VirtuaRacer: As a bit of a heads up, this is a PS3 code given out via mail to folks who purchased a PS Now copy of GT Sport. They offer a 5000 PS Now fee.
-----
MWorldII: This is legit awesome , Glad everyone got this .
-----
GhostTrick: That's a really nice way to get some money.
-----
Flandy: I don't understand why? They aren't giving out codes that you can't use on PS Now?
-----
Razgriz417: Give me the code, I'd download it
-----
Spider-Man: What are the times when you can use something like this on PS Now?
-----
Flandy: Nope, just registered with the website
-----
delete12345: Done.
-----
texhnolyze: Wow, cool. 
That's really cool. 
I wonder if this will work on PS3 as well.
-----
Hieroph: I thought this was already given out codes.

====================
~!~Is it time for Nintendo to fix the “Wii U” error when waking up in handheld mode?

Kyuur: I'm having this exact problem. It seems like it's the frozen/ frozen Pokemon game when it is in handheld mode, but when I wake up the game to confirm it up, it shows the error code. I saw it was the same for other games, including The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. 
I don’t remember having this issue before and I’m not sure if they patched or not, but I can’t be the first to it. I’m at my absolute worst playing of the game now and the framerate is choppy. It’s kinda annoying. I’ve tried all the fixes I can think of. I’m not really sure what they’re going to do to fix the problem, but I’m just hoping they’ve got their money on fire.
-----
Mike Rambo: I believe they fixed it for other titles too
-----
Raysoul: I had this issue for a long time too, they fixed it for Breath of the Wild, Splatoon and Smash.
-----
Khanimus: You just had to power on your Switch and wait for Pokemon to plug in the power cable.
-----
DarknessTear: Yeah, I had this problem for a long time too. I had to turn off the Switch completely. It wouldn't let me start up the game.
-----
Khanimus: Ahh ok, I'll believe it when I see it. I'm not sure I'll do it for other games, as I will have to keep waiting for patches before I tackle this.
-----
SmashN'Grab: I was able to get around it by power surge fitting the Switch back into the dock and re-booting, but it's still a bit annoying.
-----
Lord Brady: Powerline Switch is better than a UPS.
-----
hanshen: What the fuck happened to that GameXplain software back in 2014? Because I woke up in the middle of the night, the Switch wakes up, right when it's done sleep, in the middle of a bed, in the middle of a poor man's NFL Blitz game.
-----
Khanimus: I found this out yesterday. Powerline
====================
~!~Why do we have to keep an eye out for these strange, imaginary worlds?

delete12345: I'm just curious about what these worlds could be.
I want to know what happened to this world:
I bought a video game back in 2007.
I had no idea that the story was this absurdly bizarre, and sad, story.
It was a small town in New Mexico, I was lucky enough to call my local Community College and saw the game at a local rental store.
I went check in to the store, and then went to my local Wal-Mart and saw that the game came out one day (my birthday present). 
The game was in a box in an older department store, and there was a poster that said "The Secret of the Forest", and I thought that was really cool.
I didn't know what to look for other than that.
-----
Starlatine: mostly because i live in a bubble, after all
like if someone buys your xbox for $250 you can play marvel 2 for days
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: Because you have to
-----
KZXcellent: Because you have to
-----
delete12345: Ok?
Thank you.
-----
Gattsu25: Because they're things you can look at.
-----
Kafkaa: I live in a bubble and don't have a lot of those.
I feel like when you have a bubble, everything gets weird.
-----
delete12345: It feels weird to think that, when you get a new console, the home consoles will be new again. The fact that the Home Console is still there. It's called the Nintendo Switch.
-----
Gamer @ Heart: Because you can't make things that are impossible

~!~What are your hopes for Switch ports for the future of Nintendo?

mazi: a ports, no? i just heard a rumor from an NX dev that they will be porting 3ds games to Switch, and i want to believe it. i know the wiiu didn't require any hardware, and the wiiu used it as a portable, but i think it would be a great way to expand the audience for 3ds eshop if they only want to sell games on it, and also expand their reach for 3ds games that won't be out of the system for them.
what do you think?
thanks to sea of thieves and other games as example
-----
Cess007: I hope they make them for you. I like Nintendo games, and I want to play them on Switch.
-----
FiXalaS: I hope for a port.
-----
MouldyK: I think they would just wait for a new console and release 3DS games on it.
Currently working on Luigi's Mansion 3 and I think we will also see a port of 1st Party Fire Emblem with the new characters.
-----
Fuzzy: I hope they make them for me.
-----
Pancracio17: I want a port of WoW and W3 games.
-----
CielTynave: I mean, I was just wondering why we didn't see any ports of WoW and W3.
-----
Shiba: Hopefully they get the graphical and gameplay ports they want to.
-----
Zalman: They can just not put them on Switch. They should port them to other platforms.
-----
Chie Satonaka91: I'd really like to see a port of Xenoblade Chronicles.
-----

====================
~!~The Pokémon Company is doing a QoL update on the competitive aspect of the Switch.

Joseki: I found this in the latest Direct:
-----
RochHoch: Wow... I'm gonna assume they're updating the current TCG Online Tournament system?
-----
Phantom Thief: I'm not expecting anything very significant, but I'm fine with them taking the time as they see fit.
-----
ILikeFeet: yes
-----
Viking Jesus: They'll probably just patch it to work with the current engine and we're happy. Seems like a nice gesture.
-----
Atheerios: The only thing I'm not happy about is the fact that there's no Home Run Contest.
-----
KoolAid: They patch it when it's ready
-----
Papaya: I'm not sure I understand your point. I mean, it's not really a big deal if it happens, but I guess they want to make sure the TCG continues making new games.
-----
LordKano: It's a little known fact that the TCG is still in maintenance mode. It's a little jarring going back to the 1.5 update.

~!~Why is it so hard to find a game with a good story?

Jingo: This is not a list thread, its a thread to discuss your favourite stories in games that you liked to play, and your experiences with a game that you liked to play, or vice-versa.
I figured this would be a place for us to vent and discuss our favourite stories in games that we enjoyed to play, or vice-versa.
Examples:
-Final Fantasy XII on PS2
-Metal Gear Solid 2 on PSX
-Metal Gear Solid 3 on Xbox
-Metal Gear Solid 3 on the Xbox 360
-The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on NES
-Ocarina of Time on SNES
-Super Metroid on 3DS
-Soul Blazer on NES
-Castlevania Bloodlines on SNES
-Metroid Prime on PC

Cybersai: I mean, it's not like people don't like spoilers, but if you are going to post a spoiler, why would you post a spoilery thread.

~!~Whelp at [email protected]

Dante_727: Hello there.
After not being too fond of the Battlefield series for years I finally picked up Wargroove for the XBOX. I loved WW2 and BF4 and I've been itching to play a WW2 shooter for a bit now.
So on this day I decided to pick up Wargroove. I've played the closed beta but I'm waiting until people have played and give feedback to see if they like it.
I'm hoping to get this on the Switch. First and foremost, it is a F2P game.
The game is made by a former 1 star developer (Lars Parross) and they have a very passionate fan base.
So if anyone cares about making a thread about a F2P game, Brace yourself and don't post if you are not sure about it.
I will be making the thread myself and will be updating as I open it.
I have decided to just keep it as closed as possible. I've also decided not to be a bulletproof argument about it.
I will however be making the thread when I open it and if I ever see somebody who know about the game or has a similar experience with it, let me know. I don't want this to be a trial or a platform test for people to get the idea or even proof of ownership or anything.
I really want to make this thread cause I want to share my love for this game and hopefully get people to play it.
Please use this thread instead of this:
"discuss [word] in a lame way, please"

~!~"The Spoony Hou" by West coast radio personality David Haddad (East Coast radio)

Dusk Golem: This was posted last night, and it got me thinking about the guy, David Haddad.
Haddad is known for having one of the most annoying, and in some ways racist, comments he'd ever make. For instance, he'd make a situation like this:
He'd have a thicket with people, threatening them with a bat, then drive all the lanes full of players and looters to get their guns.
I know there's a video about this guy, but I doubt he'd make such an inflammatory attack nearly as bad as this.
-----
HououinKyouma: I really like David so I'm importing this.
-----
WillyFive: "Get down."
-----
Plum: "I want to see your pet's ass" was my favorite when I was younger. Enjoyed him having fun with me afterwards.
-----
Danis Saur: I just read the previous thread and it totally made me think, this guy is just a dick.
-----
Ahasverus: "but David fucking hates guns, David hates the fucking FPS genre" 
Damn
-----
FairyEmpire: "I have guns and I hate FPS games."
No, I don't. I like them when they're fun and not something I have to think about, even if they're not super engaging to me. Overwatch is one of my favorite games now, I'm already addicted to the grind and time grind that comes with it. I just hate that they're so prevalent among my base, and it's just aggravating me that I don't have the time to commit to them.
-----
TheDanger: "How about we not get in trouble for playing with the aim gun? Get fucked!"
-----
Zacmortar: "I'm an unarmed black kid in a racist dystopia, you monster. Have fun with Overwatch, don't worry. I'mma get in tonight"
-----
Dusk Golem: I think he's kind of right, there is a reason for how the FPS genre is, it's the way the genre is, it's the reason why the games don't have quite the same "humor" to them. I mean, I love the grimy comic-book style animation of the game
====================
~!~D3 FINAL FANTASY XV is the most gorgeous game of this generation

SolVanderlyn: Final Fantasy XV is the most impressive looking game of this gen. It's clear that SE has been working hard to make this generation as beautiful as it can be. The attention to detail, the ability to immerse itself into the small screen, and the ability to look at the screen and really think is what makes this gen so beautiful. It's absolutely gorgeous.
I really have no idea how to describe it better. It's unbelievable. I remember running through Yggdras and thinking how damn good it looked in this game. I couldn't have imagined how beautiful the environments were, just pure, pure white. I wish Square would go back to making that beautiful game 3 years later.
What do you all think of Final Fantasy XV?
-----
Brannon: It's the best looking game of this gen IMO.
(I'm also a little bit surprised at how beautiful it looks in the Switch version -- I've yet to play the game on the 3DS)
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I love this gen.
-----
Aters: It's the most beautiful game of this gen.
-----
BubbleButt64: I agree, it's the best looking game of this gen.
-----
Arkeband: I've been thinking about this a lot. It’s one of my favorite looking games to date.
-----
StuKen: it's the best looking but I don't even like gen 4/5 zelda games.
-----
Poppy: yeah it's the best looking game of this gen imo, i like it so much more than the other 2d games and the combat is great as well
-----
gogojira: It’s the only game in the series I have a problem with actually looking good. Other than that, it’s the best looking. 
I believe Breath of the Wild is better looking than any game since BotW.
-----
Revolsin: Yeah, I really agree.
The only Zelda game that really impresses me is BotW. I think it's one of the best looking games of this gen.

~!~RTTP: Shining Force: On the brink of death

oni-link: I was playing the Japanese version of this back when it came out, and was really blown away at the level design, music, story mode and all, great voice acting
I've played the US version for probably around 18-20 hours, and am still loving it, and I have to say that the story mode is VERY good
The battle system is super exciting, and the game is a blast
The story mode is a very interesting read, and I think it's one of the best you can get in a video game
I'm not a big fan of the character designs, but I think they are pretty tame compared to some other SRPGs out there
The battle system is pretty engaging, and a lot of it is
So, what are your thoughts on this?
-----
Maxina: It’s an amazing game. I don’t think it outshines SRPGs in the way, but it’s a really unique experience.
-----
Waffle: I had no idea this was out, loved it.
-----
Toth: The story mode is amazing. The boss fights are super fun and I like how the world is a mix of fantasy and western. The story is interesting and kicks ass. The combat is fun too.
-----
Jaded Alyx: I loved the story. I still have my save file with the Japanese version somewhere.
-----
Maxina: I think it's one of the best games I played last generation. I think it's one of the best games of that generation. It's a fantastic experience.
-----
Ada: I played it yesterday, it's a good game. I'm not sure why I had a disc lying around for so long. I'll make sure to get it when it comes out.
-----
V_ac: I remember trying it at a friends house once, and being blown away by how good it felt to play. I wish it was a CoD game or a 2-3D open world with mechs.
-----
Katsubento: I bought it for the PS4 and was very disappointed when it didn't come with a story mode. I thought it would be great on Switch but it's just not. I regret not picking it up on the PS4 sale.
-----
Toth: I haven

~!~PSA: Playing through SotC: The Umbral Fury

CannonFodder52: I've been playing through SotC: The Umbral Fury for the last time on PS4 and it's a beautiful game with great music, great lighting and some really great puzzles.
The only complaint of the game is the lack of a map. It looks like a PS2 title but I've heard this is fixed.
I've just re-played the main missions and hit a wall with the gem system. Can I just use the Gem then go back to the main mission or am I SOL?
-----
Dark_Castle: You can still use the gem. It unlocks a new "bonus" stage for you to do each morning.
-----
CannonFodder52: I can't remember which was which but I think it's SOTC or SotC. I'm playing on a base PS4.
-----
Captain of Industry: If you don’t have SotC yet, I highly recommend it. The best part of the game is the atmosphere. SOTC is a ghost town full of bloody great ghost towns.
-----
Starlatine: am I SOL with this one? If so, then you can get the other ones and maybe get some other paths and puzzles to do. It's a very gameplay-focused game, but its levels are laid out with puzzles in mind that are applicable to any and every game, be it PS1, PS2 or 3 era.
the fun is completing some of the toughest levels in the game. i recommend doing the daily challenges (not the ones in the beginning), climbing the world and engaging the in boss fights on the highest of the difficulty.
-----
Dark_Castle: I've been meaning to buy it as well for a few weeks after getting Sekiro. I'm glad I did, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to be sitting on backlog for such a long period of time.
-----
CannonFodder52: Yeah, I think the only way to do the challenges on NG+ is to max your inventory size. 
Also, you can always buy the rest of the stuff you can get from the main menu to max out your amiibo stat.
-----
Cartridge Games: I think you can get a few more mission types than you’d like, but I

~!~A 3DS ad that should've hit before the 2DS launched has been released

ggx2ac: You know, it's a 3DS ad.
WHOOP YOO OLD MAN YEAH.
-----
OmniStrife: This ad is bad.
-----
Phantom Thief: That’s a very good ad. I rather not see the 3DS ad.
-----
Zalman: 3DS ads have always been bad.
-----
Serebii: This ad is bad and disappointing.
I hope that Nintendo ad opens up and it’s good
-----
JershJopstin: Come on, Reggie.

~!~Altered Beast: A retro-styled, low-budget Japanese beat-em-up with solid visuals and a ton of personality

More_Badass: ​
Altered Beast’s art style is just incredible. It has a quirky, weird, quirky art style, and the gameplay is kind of a mix between Final Fantasy and X-Wing FPS. It’s also surprisingly polished, with lots of functional upgrades and upgrades for free-form exploration and combat. It’s also based on the same IP as the aforementioned game, but with a more "inspired" look to it.
I haven’t had a chance to try it yet, but if anyone's played it, I’d recommend giving it a shot. There’s a lot of depth to it. It’s up on Steam and iOS here and there.
-----
Wimps: Thanks for this. Will give it a try.
-----
G_Shumi: I remember enjoying the concept, and thought it was great. I think I like the artstyle more but it's not for me.
-----
mazi: thanks! its heavily inspired by the iwata series and it's also a pretty nice homage to that older iwata aesthetic.
-----
Strings: I loved the original iwata art back when it came out and the artbook is my favourite iwata work ever. 
I think this looks really neat.
-----
Camstun187: Thanks for the heads up!
-----
More_Badass: Is this a spiritual sequel or a reboot?
If it's a reboot, I’d say Scholar
-----
More_Badass: Scholar is a spiritual successor to the original Iwata art in a way. It completely changes the art style, and most of all it’s adds a lot of functionality and options to the game like it never before
-----
Soulflarz: Looks cool.
-----
Mitch: It's a spiritual successor to Iwata Art. If you like that look I recommend checking it out.
The trailer does seem like it's looking to be a lot of fun, like iwata was doing a lot of similar art for the past decade or so

~!~I want a new Monster Hunter RPG game.

SageShinigami: I'm playing the Switch version and it's driving me nuts.
The first thing that comes to mind is Trails in the Sky, but I think it's maybe even better in terms of world and characters.
The music is so good though.
I'm kind of looking forward to this on PS4. I have Monster Hunter for my Switch, but I've been wanting to go back to that series.
-----
LowParry: I think it's on something like wait?
-----
Theswweet: It's still my favorite MH game by far.
-----
The Praiseworthy: Monster Hunter Switch, soon!
-----
SageShinigami: Did you mean Monster Hunter or Theswweet?
-----
Theswweet: I was gonna make a thread about it on Resetera.
I guess it's timed like the PS4 version for the Switch, but I also see that MH Switch is coming out in Q2.

~!~Microids vs Nintendo Everything: Why does each company have more common sense?

Deleted member 1258: I know Nintendo's open-world philosophy is definitely different, but as someone who has barely touched up games in the past several years, I couldn't help but notice how much this forum has grown over the past year. Of late, it seems like the constant discussion has focused on the recent Directs, Nintendo-centric ones, and the sheer dumbness of the online offerings, with the occasional Direct that doesn't even have a title yet.
I can't help feel that Nintendo is the premier forum for all these other weird topics about Nintendo.
-----
Zippo: Because they know what's up. They know what's up.
-----
kc44135: Nintendo has nothing to do with their Directs. Doesn't even have a Direct for that matter. They have Directs for everything.
-----
CaviarMeths: I think Nintendo's a different breed of forum, and I don't think the Nintendo Directs are that weird.
-----
Zalman: They have Directs for everything.
-----
Beartruck: It's not really a "Nintendo" forum. They focus on the games that are out currently, and not everything that might come out in the future.
-----
JoDa: They are pretty mature now and have good forums
-----
Servbot24: I haven’t noticed that much.
-----
Aokiji: I don’t know about that but nintendo has some of the best forums out there.
-----
Ferrio: Because they know what people are interested in. Nintendo's focus on long-promised consoles is a mistake.

~!~What is the best version of Sonic Unleashed?

TheDanger: I recently bought a Sega Mega SG-1000 and while I like it a lot, the one thing I do miss is the Sonic Unleashed games getting the time they need to be able to play on the original hardware. The Genesis version is so far away of a remake that it doesn't really warrant an entire remake, but the Genesis version is still the best version. I'm talking about the enhanced ports and the original artwork and music, especially the artwork is far better than the original as well as a lot of changes including the removal of the scary music the original had. I love the music and the voice acting. One thing that I just don't get is how the story can be completed in the exact same way that it was in the original. The story is told in a fragmented, confusing way. The Adventure mode is also not very good and I think the way to play it is by hand, the game is just buggy and the way it is meant to be played is just buggy. 
This is my favorite version of Sonic Unleashed. I played it for the first time a few years ago and I remember enjoying it immensely, but I can't help but find it hard to go back to

~!~Is it time for a Capcom/Atlus comeback?

AztecComplex: In the wake of the recent success of the handheld titles, it is time for Capcom and Atlus to venture back into the handheld arena. Let's take a look at their resume.
From the gargantuan success of Street Fighter V to the relatively lesser reception of Resident Evil 7, we have several title that had great retail and download japanese release and download only titles. In the absence of Mario and Sonic Mania, I feel that the temptation of AA ports of 3D and 2D sidescrollers are the most profitable opportunity to release a new game and a new OST. Where this doesn't immediately occur is on the Switch.
While Capcom has been releasing ports of their western franchises (Monster Hunter, Ace Attorney, Resident Evil, and several spinoffs) to Western markets, they announced a new IP with a very interesting retail packaging that is probably required to get the game there:
The game features a beautiful blue bomberman version of Street Fighter V:
While the retail release is a complete mess at first, the download required to get the game there has been endorsed by Capcom's marketing team:
While the digital download version does include the season 2 arcade edition of Street Fighter V. No word on whether the retail release includes the season 2 box art on the box.
While the official title screen for the game includes multiple different colors, the game recently caught on with the PS4/Xbone in terms of distribution. The game is available in Japan digitally in retail stores and the US and the US has been steadily becoming a PlayStation country. While there is no official official release date for the game yet, it is expected to release sometime in 2019.
As for the collectors edition, Capcom's marketing team has said that it is the full game with all DLC and post-launch DLC. Presumably, the physical edition will include both season 1 and 2 costumes and the special edition of the game featuring additional artbook and accessories.
Do you think it would be time for a comeback Capcom? Why did you feel that the time has come?
-----
Jawmuncher: The Switch is a great place to start a collection.
-----
Silky: It's not about release date or box art or anything.
-----
KtSlime: Because it's a Megaman Collection featuring a TON of Megaman games.

~!~How to keep up with PSN cloud saves

chefbags: My PSN cloud saves are all in one folder. I've created a new folder named PSN\Backup\BackVirus and set it to backup. I'm not sure if there is an upload feature or not as I could be messing around with the cloud storage settings. I was just curious if there is an upload-in feature and if so how to upload it to it? I know there is a folder lock function, but I'm not sure how to do that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

~!~Does anyone enjoy their ancient Japanese RPGs and other JRPGs on PC?

Simba: Hey guys,
I want to play some of these old school RPG snes RPGs. For example I will gladly play them on PC. I am playing Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Final Fantasy VII.
I am wondering does anyone here enjoy these old school jrpgs? They seem to be great.
-----
Syril: It's a great game, but it's got some issues (idk why play a game on PC, but like you do, play it on any other platform) and the controls are weird. That's probably why I prefer playing on PC, as I prefer emulation.
-----
CaviarMeths: I enjoy them, but I'm not sure which one they are.
A lot of the Ys games aren't available on Steam, for example Ys V. I believe Falcom usually port their games over from their own collection rather than re-releasing them.
-----
Aters: YsVIII was never on Steam. It was september 2011 and they ported it to Steam. Falcom is not a good developer when it comes to the emulation of their games.
-----
KhandoleezzaRice: I enjoyed my time with them. They are very old school JRPGs, and I wish more devs would work on them.
-----
Simba: Ah well. This is one of my favorite old school RPG's. I think they were made in Germany.
-----
Weltall Zero: YsVIII was in development for a long time. The developers played the system in private meetings, but ultimately they decided to port it to Steam a few years ago.
-----
CaviarMeths: I think you're right about two key things. If you were Sega the company would not be so backwards on this.
1. The port would be very difficult to make.
2. The port would be missing some of the cool features of the original game, like the ability to change the movement speed, the ability to hire NPCs, and even the famous "interactive" mini game.
-----
Dazraell: I remember playing the first Ys on PC and it was such a treat. I wish more devs would try to port these games to modern hardware.

I remember seeing the wii guide there but I think that was it. The regular guide is a bit more informative, though.

~!~Do you think the next Nintendo Switch will use the 3DS's screen space to render the 3D graphics?

Meelow: I recently started playing Mario and I really liked it, but I really wanted to like it, and thought the 3D was rather big, and I thought the games looked pretty bad, but after I played it again I noticed that I noticed a difference, and it's really fun!
I also noticed that the game looks really bad with 3D backgrounds, so I have a bad feeling it will never happen because I don't know if it's possible to fix this, or I will be stuck in Cuphead forever, but I thought it looks so good, that it would be cool if Nintendo did a change that Nintendo would make a new 3DS XL, just like this Mario game:
-----
Cartridge Games: Doesn’t seem like a big deal, probably.
Imagine it’s a soft refresh that renders the 3D graphics. Maybe a Switch 2
-----
Deleted member 15538: That's a big dissapointment.
-----
I Wanna Be The Guy: I know this isn't a huge deal but 3DS screens will forever be bigger than Switch screens in the future.
-----
MidnightCowboy: I don't know if I would care that much about this topic.
-----
Krejlooc: 3DS screens are already too small. Just go away.
-----
Meelow: That's a big dissapointment, I'll wait for the Switch 2.
-----
Krejlooc: The games look so bad with 3D I can't even remember the name of the game, it's the first Mario game I played that had 3D backgrounds, it's not even a Mario game.
-----
Brazil: I’d love to see the Switch 2 get a soft refresh, but Nintendo doesn’t seem interested.
-----
Meelow: That is the biggest problem right?

====================
~!~Why do developers and publishers get so much flak for not doing anything about their biggest selling IPs?

Memento: we are nearing the end of this gen for sure. We are just about at the tail end of this gen and the next big thing is probably in the third or possibly fourth gen when we get closer to the tailend of the next decade. We had Breath of the Wild and it didn’t go over 2 million units. The next Zelda and it did over 10 million units. GTA 5 and 5-7 million units. We even had a huge launch in the first place, and most publishers seem to get plenty of flak for their biggest games.
Then we get for 2019 and beyond where we are already. We are getting a lot of games from big publishers, indies and microtransactions, but the real beast is the treatment of their employees. Who do you fall in the general credits section? Who do you fall in the Senior Executs section? And what is the holdup? Is it because they don't invest anymore?
-----
Kolx: They get the most praise because they don't release the games unfinished.
-----
VillagerMax: Mostly because they don't want to base a game off a certain state or something like that. They want to create a polished experience with the most polish and polish and money they can get.
-----
Memento: I think most of them just got tired of how bad the performance of their games and they just moved on.
-----
Clix: They get the least criticism, but they have the least variety in their games.
-----
Aokiji: They get what they want.
-----
Kolx: And they get paid.
-----
Tribal24: They get more money, they benefit from better games and they see growth in their brand and in the industry itself rather than in sales and profits. The only issue is they enjoy more power in direct competition with Microsoft.
-----
Memento: They get more money and they benefit from better games and a more connected community.
-----
Village: They get more money, they benefit from better games and the existing fanbase seems to be a much better fit for them, especially in light of the narrative in Spider-Man

~!~Anyone ever bought a new PC?

MRORANGE: I have been thinking about buying a new PC lately and I'm curious if there are any "true" pros and cons to each? I'm completely open to all types of PC's and don't need special peripherals to play them. (I don't need a big graphics card to do so I just bought a GTX 1070).
-----
DocSeuss: I'm not sure exactly exactly but I've got a pretty neat little PC with a Ryzen tower and an i5 2600k and I'm not even sure why I want it. I got the CPU for the thing and the GPU for the CPU.
-----
Hate: I do. Although I’m a bit more reserved to play games on my phone.
-----
Madjoki: I have a GTX 1070, Ryzen 1600 + integrated gpu.
I don't know if that will matter for me, but for me PC is more like a hobby to me.
-----
JaseC: I'd say my preferred use case is a console that's quickly read, and I can play games on PC in short bursts. (I play on console games on a plane every once in a while, so I can't just watch a couch soccer game, or play a lot of strategy games, any day)
-----

molnizzle: I've just got a GTX 1070, Ryzen 1600 + integrated gpu.
-----
JaseC: I've got a Ryzen 1600 and an i7 6700k, and I'm pretty confident that I can play PC games anywhere I'd want, but I'm also not sure if I'd buy a PC that's just a subset of a console.
-----
Dr. Caroll: I have a Vega 64 GPU, Ryzen-based processor. It's my preferred setup whenever I play Doom or Wolfenstein: The New Order, but I can't really go for full-fledged PC gaming in the future.
-----
SmarmySmurf: My most recent PC purchase is a GTX 1070. It's my preferred setup for demanding games and I'm not rushing to upgrade.

~!~Will we ever get a genuinely good character action game from NMH developers?

AuthenticM: I am currently playing through these games (1, 2, and 3) and thought they were among the best we've had in the last decade. I know they were mostly ported to the Switch, but I am curious as to what the general consensus is on the genre.
I will say that 2 and 3 are my favorites. The first one is pretty much the pinnacle of the genre and just blew my mind when it was first announced. That said, I have always dreamed of a NMH style action game in the future. It's a genre I have always wanted to try and dabble in, but I am not sure if I want it or not.
Are there any other NMH-style action games that you can think of? I have played all the mainline and second run NMH games (with the exception of the co-op ones on 3DS).
-----
Liquid Snake: I would be interested in playing a game like that.
-----
Mbolibombo: I think we'll get a NMH reboot in the next decade.
-----

NKnight7: I'd love to play a game that's like that.
-----
Cess007: Hm, I don't think I've ever heard of this.
-----
Mr. Shakedown: I think NMH is the closest thing to guerilla games I've ever played so it could be cool, but I think the genre as whole could use a shake up and maybe a new generation of superhero games.
-----
Zool: I’d be interested in a game that has the system system mechanics from long ago
-----
TheMoon: NMH is one of those games that you could dip into the dictionary and find a great list of favorite terms.
-----
Platy: but it really was Racho games !

~!~The best gaming gifts I got in 2017

the_blitz: I was pretty excited when I realised that I got a lovely birthday present from my brother.
I don't know when I had the first gaming event but I definitely used to get birthday presents from my brother but it's been a long time since I particularly received a gaming related gift and this was my first gaming event. The only other thing I remember is getting a PS4 for Christmas but the one and only thing I played on it was Halo Reach.
What are your gaming gifts you got in 2017?
-----
Spaced Harrier: Pokemon Go, yesterday. Superb.
-----
Conor419: A PS4 for Christmas. Even more than the other day, since I had a New Years resolution to get me a Switch.
-----
TheGift: Final Fantasy IX. I played about 2 hours of Final Fantasy 9 on the PS1, and it was my first Final Fantasy game and I was so happy.
-----
Akelisrain: Pokemon Go.
-----
Dark Cloud: Portal 2. It was my first console game and it made me a better person for going through this journey.
-----
Funyarinpa: Half Life 2. 
I still remember being so proud of my first console I completely forgot my name.
-----
Pascal: Silent Hill 2.

~!~Nintendo Switch Online: Do you play with Nintendo Online and/or Nintendo Account Points?

TheGreatMightyPoo: So with the recent news about Smash Bros Ultimate being delayed until the end of the year, I figured it was worth making a thread for the sake of the thread.
I do not play with online friends and therefore can’t compare with friends on the Switch Online service.
I am curious what y’all liked about Nintendo Online and/or Nintendo Account Points. Personally I really liked the feeling of being able to play with friends and having my save file backup after every online play session. I also really like the online feels of being able to play with certain IPs and all the unlocks.
I am curious what y’all liked about Nintendo Online, and if there are any other people you’d like to chat with, share some of your experiences with them or maybe even play with them!
-----
carlosrox: Nintendo Online was the only online Nintendo game I really liked and I didn't have much fun with it.
The only online game that I really really liked was Splatoon 2 and that was enough to get me to play for a year.
And yes, Nintendo Online isn't perfect. Splatoon was the most frustrating and laggy thing I've played in years. But I really liked it.
-----
MetalLord: I play online with the x in smash and it's pretty nice. It's not a perfect solution but it's a nice little service for people that might want to play online.
-----
Ouroboros: I played with a friend at my local store. We all have different friends that play smash online alot but one of our games had us stuck at the bloody point in the arcade where the other person was smash himself and it was a pretty miserable experience. He was trying to get a group across from him so we could play as a team across and we just weren't able to do it.
-----
TheGreatMightyPoo: How long did it take you to buy from the eshop?
-----
Mcjmetroid: I like Smash online a lot. I think Smash online is a worse service than Smash Bros online.

~!~The Switch has a lot of problems, but the Switch itself is awesome

theofficefan99: I've had my Switch since launch, and picked it up in its first two days. I bought myself a Controller for the 3DS and a 3DS XL, and I've been playing my copy of Hollow Knight and it's been a joy to play ever since. It's also the best handheld I have EVER played. 
I've had four different joycons and the Switch is by far my favorite original experience ever. I think it's because the original controller feels like a $200 toy. I don't need better controllers because I'm already using a Switch. 
My problem is the Switch itself. Playing any game requires a pretty awful pair of joycons. My left hand is horrible, but most of the time with my joycons it's fine. I don't have hand cramps or giant claw pads, and I can't even hold a higher degree of input. I can't use the damn thing because I can't hit secrets in Ocarina of Time. It's just too big, my right hand hurts every now and then. My biggest complaint so far is the cursor. I'm playing it mostly sitting, though.
I'm not sure if I'll like it. Maybe I'll just buy another joycon, but I don't know. I really don't know. I guess I'll wait for a cheaper price before buying another though.
All in all, I love the Switch, and I'm happy with it. I played my copy of Ocarina of Time exclusively while I was in bed at night, so it's not like I'm dropping sleep on the thing...
-----
Etrian Darkness: I don't use it that much but I still use it to this day. Compared to my pro controller or anything else I think it's very comfortable.
-----
FireWarrior: its just one of those things that just doesnt work for me, i dont think its as bad as a pro controller
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, I use it a lot, but I mostly go handheld for other reasons. I love using it as a handheld, and I absolutely adore it.
-----
Kazooie5659: I have a few pairs of joycons and trackpads. I'm using the right one for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart, and the left for Smash. I hold onto

~!~Switch owners, are you more likely to buy a game if it comes out on switch?

ScOULaris: For the sake of this thread, I'm going to categorize "Switch owners" as those who own a Switch and have a PS4 and/or PC as well as a PS4 and/or PC.
I LOVE portable gaming and have a pretty active library of games for this device. However, I'm not a particularly hardcore console warrior or high end PC gamer so I'm always up for a quick handheld experience more than a console experience.
For whatever reason, I've always been more of a Switch owner. I love the device and its great games, but I can't commit to picking up a game before it's released on Switch. I'm not a particularly fan of the device's design philosophy either, with its tall bezels that pull at my slim X-Box & Gamecube controller, and I've already bought a Switch over a week ago. This is despite me having a Switch sitting on my couch, and the fact that it's basically a tablet in the dock. It's also less ergonomic than a handheld system. I've gotten so used to the Switch's design a week that I've been playing in the bathroom on the rare occasions that I'll dock it up and bend open some areas and bend the dock to play in the various areas surrounding the TV.
I'm not exactly one to come back to it when it's goes, but I've decided that I want to finally dip my toes into something portable. I've yet to buy a game that I didn't plan to, so I'm curious as to what people here might enjoy as well.
Anyway, feel free to suggest any story or insights into the Switch's design philosophy. I'm curious as well.

~!~The overworld theme from The Division 2 is not good

osnameless: So, I actually just loaded up The Division 2 after many many months and I finally got the music starting to play in the intro. Having not played the game since release, for some reason, since the very beginning, I heard the overworld theme over and over again, and I really like it.
But I think I have a problem: The overworld theme is really bad. It starts, ends, and even the second half of the song is a little disappointing. It is even worse because it is the second time during the music starts, that the theme starts to play.
This is because the opening and ending of the song starts right after the overworld theme. 
What happened here? Is it a crunch fest? Is it a tense open world game? 
I just don't understand this song. It is so bad I don't even understand the game, I am not even fucking 19. 
It is so bad I am not even trying to understand it. I understand it to mean that the game is a lot smaller than the one I am, but when it starts, it is really bad. 
I heard it before at a PC Gamescom a while ago, but I never played it again.
-----
Darktalon: I think the main theme is not great, but the 3rd Prey mission has some great highs. I respect that it's a sci-fi themed space opera, but it's just so lethargic and lacking in atmosphere.
-----
SirBaron: The public domain soundtrack is great.
-----
osnameless: Haha. Never even heard the overworld theme before. Damn.
-----
Kadzork: I love the prey mission.
-----
Stiler: It's great, but not spectacular, the atmosphere is great, and the game is short, probably 5-8h.
-----
KillLaCam: It's not the best song but it is really bad, I can't remember anything about it
-----
osnameless: Yeah, I am pretty sure I heard that song two or three times already. I do have a question though. In the prey mission, what exactly is the atmosphere and music like outside of the base stations and whatnot?
-----
DrKelpo: It's not a great song, but I love

~!~[UK] MyNintendo accounts are stolen

Chessguy1: i just got a notice on my eShop telling me my account was being used to pre-order Super Mario Party.
the notice in the letter says yes you can do this.
It does not affect my access to the eShop but it is totally different to the normal software. 
Finally, my account is now locked out of any activity and if i paypal is still in my account i cant access anything and the payment funds are safe.
i have 2FA and i can access the eShop and paypal without leaving my switch in the dock.
so what do you all do i should be able to access our eShop and no longer be in a group that can take payment on our eShop.
-----
L.O.R.D: i paypal is my account i don't leave the eShop in the game.
-----
ChessGuy: I left the game in the portable overnight and got kicked from the account for a few minutes, but the account i was in on the localised boot. I didn't get any login prompt, but i got the email i got from Nintendo going around.
This is not normal, this is a Nintendo thing.
-----
L.O.R.D: i got the email.
the eShop only let me pre-order if i wanted to.
-----
L.O.R.D: it's an eShop email i didn't get. i did get a message telling me that i can't access my eShop, but i was in the right section.
-----
ChessGuy: Well that's fucked up!
I can't even contact Nintendo about this at all, it's absolutely illegal and Nintendo should just comply.

Rumored announcement at Blizzcon
Release date of the "World of Warcraft Classic" remaster announced

Svart: WoW Classic is like the most expensive hot dinner in the world to be, not what you'd expect.

Rodjer: That's Shao Kahn.

Baconmonk: WoW Classic is the most expensive hotdog in the world. It's not what you'd expect.

~!~SuperSunday: Star Fox Grand Prix

TheDanascius: SuperSunday releases on October 7th on the Nintendo Switch and contains the Starfox GP set. It is priced at £23.99 and can be pre-ordered through the site below.
The Starfox GP set comes with four games in the Fox series, all published by Fox, all-new to the series.
-----
TheDinoman: I'm excited to play this again. 
I loved the Star Fox Assault games on the GameCube, and the Star Fox Assault: Origins games are so good. 
I might pick this up, I really enjoyed the Assault games on the GC.
-----
TheDinoman: I guess it's a good deal for the first time in a while.
-----
TheDinoman: I still think they're better games to come back to.
-----
theofficefan99: Kinda wish I bought the GBA game instead of this for my son.
-----
TheDinoman: I guess it's good to have the GBA game back.
-----
TheDanascius: How would you compare it to the GBA game?
-----
TheDanascius: I think the GBA game is great.
-----
TheDanascius: The Starfox racing games are pretty fun and I was super surprised to learn they were based on the Fox series. I guess that's why I loved the GBA series. It's a shame the series is dead :(

~!~The best way to play the Mega Man Legacy Collection

SolVanderlyn: I've been mulling over this for a while. I've read all the Mega Man fan wikis and forums, and I'm sure I'm well on the right track. I just want to hear from those who have played the Legacy Collections as well as who may have played the original.
I've read that the games are all about 7-9 hours long, which sounds about right for a Mega Man game, but I'm not sure how long it is. I've checked the summaries by the Producer, it's a little hard to tell but I'm sure. I've also read that the game is designed to be played in short sessions, which doesn't sound appealing.
I'm wondering if there are other people here not interested in this sort of thing too, or are there other games that I've played that might be similar?
I'm also interested in any general Mega Man news sites and general retro gaming trends, or any Mega Man related YouTube channels.
-----
Grapezard: There's a bunch of videos like this.
-----
ZiggyPalffyLA: This is where I’d be fit
-----
Raysoul: Yep.
-----
Professor Beef: I like the format, but the amount of content is a bit low. I'd recommend watching Mega Man LC 1 & 2 over 5 times.
-----
Krejlooc: If you're interested in the games, the Mega Man Legacy Collection is a collection of the first two Mega Man games. You can check out the old games' OT on GAF if you want.
-----
Krejlooc: oh cool, thanks, that's great.
-----
Rygar 8Bit: The only good part of those games is the music.
-----
Nights: I don't know, but yeah, these are the games I've played the most (in a series that's) on the NES and SNES. I definitely played the older games. Mega Man 3, 4, and 5 are also in the series, but I enjoyed them most of the time.
I'd recommend playing them on the original hardware, if possible.
-----
Teggy: Mega Man 1 and 2 were good, but 3 is actually my favorite of the series.

====================
~!~Are there any other PS4 games that you really like on Playstation?

Jawmuncher: So I figured it'd be nice to hear from all the PS4 exclusives that you really like. Obviously there are many reasons why people like certain games. But there are a few big reasons that I'm looking for too. 
Reason #1: Why I need a PS4 to stay engaged in everything I'm watching on television. TV as a medium is the only thing I care for and a major reason why I haven't dived more into the PS4 this gen. The reason I don't tend to go online for games is because I have limited time to play on my commute. If I have limited time to play I don't want to get home and come play something else. I don't want to be off my rock for 4 hours at a time. 
I also have limited time to play on my commute. I commute to work by car so it's not anything big to me. I also don't really like playing on my phone so it can cause me to never be able to plan when and where I'm playing and it makes me less attentive to the games I play. 
So what's your reason for wanting to play certain games? 
My main reason for not using my console is so that I can play my Switch on it. 
Asking for a comprehensive list would be a little difficult. 
-I'm tired of reading or watching movies. I prefer reading to watching the story unfold. 
-I'm traveling so I limit my time to play games. I want to play on the plane or bus. 
-I'm older and I don't want to have to play certain games. 
-I'm more concerned about getting the job done. 
-I don't have the time to play many games. 
-I love my house and want to finish some books. 
-I'm very much into games now and want to play more. 
-I don't have a TV. 
So my top 3 cause for consideration would be:
1) Red Dead Redemption. 
It's another open world game set in rural South where you're doing your taxes and you're getting shot. 
-The setting is similar to GTAV. 
-You are doing taxes anyway so it's not too different than a GTA.

~!~"The 10 Best Video Games of 2018" by Norman Reedus

Hattori: Some nice details here.
He also says the most popular list this year is, well.. Gravity Rush 2 :)
-----
Shugga: The best list the last time I checked was by the brilliant Resogun
-----
Phendrift: I feel like the weird one with the best games this year was easily the best list ever
-----
Hobbesian Thudercat: That's a lot of names. Nice to see some love for Hollow Knight, and Ori and the Blind Forest, and Forgotton novel, but I was still not sold on the list yet. Ori is a really good game, and Ori is the single best one that year, and the only one that has ever made a claim to being the best as a game.
-----
HockeyGuy412: Happy to see Hollow Knight gets more exposure than any other game in the top 10
-----
pswii60: I think it's a very good list, almost at peak quality. Ori is definitely on my list.
-----
Hypron: List is not exhaustive and the list is not meant to be a list.
-----
Jasbasse: Ori is in the fun category.
-----
Dphex: 2018 is shaping up to be one of the best ever :D
I really like the list. Ori is top 3 and the list is pretty long, but really happy to see Ori become as well known as it is.
-----
Rodjer: I think Hollow Knight is the best this year. 
2018 has one of the best JRPG’s of this generation, 2018 it is top 3. 2019 will be top 4.
-----

====================
~!~What's your favorite games with a 90's style or more anime aesthetics?

DrakenAstro: Personally I have to go with this one.
If you had to choose one, what would be the best one?
My favorite is a mix between the original Metroid Prime and the recently released Super Metroid.
Super Metroid is a 90's anime aesthetic with a mix of manga and anime film. It is also extremely tough to read and the ending theme is also extremely hard to understand. The anime's are also very much like a 90's anime to me.
-----
Jaded Alyx: Metroid Prime. The first time I heard the name Prime.
-----
mrmickfran: Metroid Prime
-----
Mr. Snuffle: Metroid Prime.
-----
CaviarMeths: I think the first Metroid is a great example of this. I think it has the best feeling of the "90s" and has a very anime flair, but I can't really get away from it. It's also the most restrictive of the series because of the way it tries to amalgamate old and new stuff.
-----
KojiKnight: Metroid Prime is the correct answer.
-----
hans_castorp: Metroid's Prime is the best.
-----
Phendrift: Metroid Prime
-----
Aters: The answer is actually Metroid Prime.

-----
Cybersai: I really love PD. PD was my go to when I was a child and I have a lot of fond memories from that game. PD is my go-to recommendation for YGO games.
-----
LewieP: PD is still my favourite game ever.
It's the best Mario Kart game ever made.
It's the best TPS ever made, and the best racing game ever made.
It's the only Mario Kart game that I couldn't finish, I just plated 30 hours and I wasn't dying at all.
The best Kart racer ever made.
The best Racing game ever made.
It's my favourite Kart game ever.
It's just fantastic.
-----
Bog: I’m not sure PD is the best. I like it better than the Mario kart series, but it doesn’t hold up nearly as well.
-----
--R: PD was my go-to game from school and elementary to secondary. I can't stand it.
-----
Aigis: This is the correct answer, PD is the worst but still a good game
-----
Piscus: PD is too goddam heavy. I love the game.
-----
Dreamboum: It is, it's just that the amount of time required to perfect and perfect the controls while racing is beyond what it should take for me to enjoy myself, even after about 20 hours. I get that PD are known for having one-punch fun experiences, but they also have too many crashes, too many corners, too many modifiers and so forth. They are just not fun to play.

====================
~!~So do you think there’s a chance for this to actually happen?

Crazy Izanagi: So I’m done with Final Fantasy games. They’ve been on a streak of mediocre games I’ve just finished but nowadays they are among my favorite games out there.
I know a ton of people love to hate on the games but I’m curious as to what people would like in this situation?
I’m still deep in the second game. I know it’s just me but I’m still curious to play it.
-----
KZXcellent: I've been interested in it but the lack of fan made Classic edition re-releases has left me with a very weird feeling.
I think it's incredibly likely.
-----
Musubi: I think if they do it will probably be like KH3 where they just announce the game and you'll be there.
-----
KZXcellent: I think there's a chance there. It's been a few years but they've been a lot of fanservice games this gen.
-----
Springy: I'm afraid it's guaranteed to happen.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: The risk is very high but I dunno about that
-----
Pasokon Deacon: I've played many more hours of FF than I have of Kingdom Hearts. I started playing it again next week but as you can see, I have a huge backlog, and I can't stop playing. So I think there's a decent chance it'll happen in the next couple of releases.
-----
Crazy Izanagi: I’d like it to be on all of them. Also I remember when the first KH was coming out and the fans were all over it. All of them.
-----
KZXcellent: It's a risk, but it's manageable. If they really want to put it on everything I think they're gonna need to address.
-----
NKnight7: I've been really interested in it, but I've never gotten around to playing it.

====================
~!~Is it time for Microsoft to go the “Netflix” route with first party?

Gundam: Netflix isn’t the only way this could happen. You could say the same thing for other third party like EA, Ubisoft, and Activision.
I’m sure a lot of us on Era feel that way. I don’t think we’re going to see a full independent, Switch-only studio make a AAA game this generation and there will likely still be third party studios trying their hand in first party.
However, I mean, there’s no question that Microsoft is in a weird spot where they seem to be pushing their exclusives harder than Sony, and Microsoft has always been treated with some respect on the console side. So in this case, are they going the Netflix route with first party, or am I playing the same game they made the last generation?
I’m not saying “give me a lower budget” route, I mean, even if it did, I know that for Sony and Nintendo the AAA games they put out tend to be sub-20 hour games that require a long day/night shift, and Microsoft is in a weird spot between the two, as they both have systems where they can put out more engagement (think Game Pass) and non-AAA titles.
I mean, Microsoft has to match the number of AAA titles they put out. PlayStation is worse for example, and while I have no real problem with Sony, I do believe that their first party output is better in the long term. 
I’d be curious to see if Sony and Microsoft will go the Netflix-Netflix-less path and actually make AAA games this generation.
-----
Cartridge Games: Probably, but I imagine it depends on if/when Microsoft and Nintendo both drop the ball when it comes to first party.
Sony and Nintendo have been more independent this generation and could be a chance to chase after the streaming model but I’d rather them stick with what sticks
Nintendo has been dormant for over a decade now and have done nothing to revive it
-----
Chrome Hyena: I'm sure there are some folks who are interested in third party games for sure, but I think the question is more about the type of game, not the amount of dev time needed to make it.
-----
SigSig: I'd argue Sony and Microsoft

JayBee: It's the best selling gen 1 game. And it was never going to reach but it has done pretty good.
-----
Papaya: I think we'll see more in the next year or two. So far. I think.
-----
Papaya: Hopefully, the next pokemon game will be announced soon.

~!~Do you use an SD Card on PC?

Gundam: I recently got a new 4K UHD television (for at least the first couple years on my UHD tv. I think the only games I ever play are Civ 6 and RTS games. I have a FAT32 formatted flash card to replace the external drive and I have no problem getting games to run either).
I'm currently at work so I don't have time to play anything but I have a UHDTV to give me some space and to see what games I can/can play. I've tried the Mass Effect series, Dead Cells, and Fallout 4. None of them even popped into my library.
Anyone use an SD card on their PC and can tell me if I should spend money for a new one?
-----
FairyEmpire: I use an SD card in my computer, yes. I don't have space on my PC anymore for games, and I don't own any games on it so I can't really recommend it (I own RDR2, FFXIII-2, Witcher 3 and Tomb Raider).
-----
Mojito: No, only used it for the first time since I moved over here last year. My PC is for more demanding games, but still my top priority.
-----
D65: Nah I'm good. 
I use my high speed 5 gig usb drive for some exclusive games, it's a god tier USB device.
-----
GlassCup64: I just use my high speed 5g usb hub for exclusives. RTSS2, Destiny 2 and FF7.
-----
FairyEmpire: I've changed to a SSD so that my PC wouldn't be at any trouble. I work in an office where I don't have to deal with bad USB ports, so that would be a no-brainer. I've been using an SD card for over a decade now and I've never seen a single issue as that bad. I love having everything installed somehow, but I've never found a way to use an SD card fast enough to use games that I've already bought and installed, so that's not really a thing anymore.
-----
Gundam: I used my SD card before, no dice.
-----
Lonely1: Nope, I don't use an SD card.
-----
DarkDetective: No, because I don't

~!~Is this the first time we see a new Nintendo home console in this fashion?

Cybersai: Ever since the release of the Wii in 2006, we've had a few of these happening. The Switch was announced in January 2007 and the Xbox One and PlayStation in 2010. Now we have the current Nintendo entry on the consoles with the Switch Pro and Xbox One X.
Do you think the next Nintendo home console will be similar to the Switch Pro and Xbox One X? Will they use the same architecture? Will they use some of the benefits of the Switch Pro and Xbox One X?
-----
KZXcellent: I think so.
-----
Khanimus: Of course.
-----
TheMink: Yes.
-----
Jahranimo: Yes.
-----
Grapezard: Absolutely. I'd love to play my old games on it.
-----
Phantom Thief: Absolutely
-----
Lothars: Not sure if there will be an end of the generation, but if it does I'm sure I want the console.
-----
Cartridge Games: Hopefully.
Mostly down for a console.
-----
Phantom Thief: I think there will be a Switch Pro and/or Xbox One X revision, but I’d be surprised if the current Switch home console isn’t in the next console generation

~!~What are the chances of a Metroid Prime 4?

Robinson: The first time I heard of Metroid Prime 4 was years ago when it was first announced. I thought it was going to be another spin-off, not even a proper Prime game, just a remake, but nonetheless I was hoping it was a follow-up to Samus Returns. 
So, with all that in mind, what are the chances it's a Metroid Prime 4?
-----
Zippro: It's going to be a follow up to Fusion. It'll be a gorgeous world to explore, with a good varied and expansive world to explore, plus a lot of cool new enemies to face.
-----
AuthenticM: Zero percent.
-----
dancingphlower: I don't think there's a chance honestly. If Fusion is anything like Prime, I'm not sure it'll be as fresh or as inventive as that one game.
-----
scare_crow: Zero percent.
-----
Vert1: 100%.
-----
Bakercat: 100%.
-----
BeaconofTruth: Zero percent 100%.
-----
KtotheRoc: If it's as good as Prime Hunters, it would be a miracle.
-----
Zippro: The concept of fusion was one of my favorite things about Metroid Prime 4, what better is that than any other game I've ever played. The game is going to be a masterpiece.

Caiusto: Why would you even need to repair a controller?

RolandOfGilead: I'm a new 360 owner, I just have a new set of joycons.
I’m gonna get my regular one eventually.

Theorry: Thats what I read on the site.

CormoranStrike: It probably is. But if your joycons break down and if you don’t plan on using it for a while you could probably just replace the joycon.
The pro controller broke down after a while I think?
-----
Theorry: I mean there is a link in the op.

Pitchfork: The new pro controller broke down long ago so it is likely still there, no?

Theorry: Yeah.

~!~Full Throttle remaster on Switch now available

Captain of Outer Space: There was a big thread about this on the old forum and I figured this was a thread to bring up some of the questions we still have no answer about.
There is no remaster of the PS2 original full throttle...
Does the PS2 version have all the bells and whistles of the original release?
Does the PS3 version of the original have all the modern translation bells and whistles (e.g. English dialogue, subtitles, etc)?
Does the PS4 version of the original have all the audio bells and whistles of the original release?
Does the PS4 version of the original have all the bells and whistles of the original release?
Is the Xbox One version of Full Throttle worth getting for the remastering?
-----
Cyryus: I would recommend getting a lot of the bells and whistles from the PS2 version. There are some retro remixes and some re-remakes, but the PS4 version is a total skartest since it changes a lot of the audio effects that were in the original version.
-----

Cyryus: Thank you so much!
-----
NEE HEE HEE: How does the PS4 version work? Are there options to change the audio settings?
-----
Captain of Outer Space: It only has like 10 audio options available for each version of the original.
-----
NEE HEE HEE: I see. I just did a quick Google search and found nothing. I believe that people can buy the game digitally and get the remaster.
-----
NEE HEE HEE: I hope some of you have PS4 and Xbox One versions.
-----
Cyryus: Thank You, Nee Hee! I would love to have all the bells and whistles so I can use them when I want to. 
Also if someone is curious about this, here is a short Youtube video of it and the audio settings
-----
Captain of Outer Space: I'm not sure if this is possible, but a quick Google then turned up this developer GOG version of the original Full Throttle Remastered that was released on Steam a few weeks ago (the remastered audio is in the Steam workshop, but I'm not sure how you can access it). Steam has a full listing of what you can and cannot do with

~!~What’s the best way to play WoW on PS4?

TheDanger: So I’m in the mood for a classic game or MMORPG, something I’ve always been hesitant about (because WoW is still the only game I play on PS4) and I looked up a few options and couldn’t figure out what’s best for the time I had to play it.
So I’m looking for a way of playing it digitally, with physical copies, not just the boxed version.
I’ve already tried:
- World of Warcraft:
- Final Fantasy XIV:
- PSTV:
- many other PS4 games, I don’t even know if I can remember which ones
-----
Volimar: Apologies for the dumb question, but I don't know how to use the search function? I tried using google but couldn't find anything. Is this allowed? I read that there is no licensing fee for this, what does that mean? Is it just for fans of the original game? Because I have no idea if that's the original license.

~!~How do you feel about each Persona game?

CannonFodder52: As we all know, Persona 5 is one of the most popular and beloved RPGs out there. With a current 1 out of 5 from Japan's biggest franchise and a unanimously "best in style" review from a mainstream review system, it's one of the most cited titles on the internet.
This has made me question my thoughts on each game. Whether it's the quality of the writing, memorable gameplay mechanics or the general atmosphere of the game, how does each Persona game rank among the favorites of the bunch?
-----
ReyVGM: I like the combat and story of P5 better than 5.
-----
Phantom Thief: Persona 5 is my favorite game of all time, and I’m gonna say Persona 5 is better than 4.
-----
FiXalaS: I think they are all better games in every sense.
P5 is superior to 4 in almost every way and is the pinnacle of the franchise.
-----
Aters: I think the only one I enjoy is Persona 5. I don't think it's the best in the series at all, but it's still interesting, unique, and has the best Chiben/Metroidvania combat system.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I liked P5 better than P5.
P5's combat system is fun to use, and I enjoyed the boss fights (they are good).
-----
Aigis: Persona 2 is the best of the 3, but 4 is worth your time, as is P2
-----
VonGreckler: Persona 5 has the best story, pacing and character writing of any of the games.
-----
Phantom Thief: It’s an embarrassment of a lot! P5 is the best game in the series, and right around the best of the series!
-----
Phantom Thief: I’m gonna say Persona 5

~!~Would you play a game with a 2P connection or a high quality connection?

Vexii: Hello Era, this is my first thread and I wanted to see the responses of Era.
I would say for the most part, I would play games with a high quality connection. For example, smash bros is probably the most obvious answer, and even if we consider that the game wouldn't be special in that sense, it is just a "good" port.
If I have to go with the quality of a connection, it's usually higher quality than the quality of a connection. For example, if you compare Rainbow Six Siege to the high quality of 1080p/720p/480p on my experience, RDR2 has a better connection, but has worse quality than Siege, and I don't think that makes much sense to compare between two consoles.
So, ERA, which gaming devices do you think are really that good with a high quality connection?
EDIT: I'm not talking about a high quality connection, but the fact that the game wouldn't be special in that very specific sense. If you go by the power of the console, I can't help meaningfully define what makes a game special.
-----
MELLO: I would play a game with a cable and a high speed whatever
-----
juliamcardinals: I’d play it the same way as any other service
-----
Mazzle: I would play it with a better connection
-----
Dark_Castle: I'd play it with a wired connection. Games with cables are much better than anything with wi-fi these days.
-----
VanCityGamer: I would play a game with a wired connection and a high speed. 
If it's a game I want to play at a high quality, I usually play it on a 5ghz WiFi connection.
-----
Knight613: I usually play with a connection over Ethernet.
-----
Kouriozan: For me it was never a problem, I play a lot of pc games with a wired connection.
-----
Razgriz417: i played DOOM with a wired service while commuting, it was awesome
-----
Vexii: My connection is crappy atm so I always go wired.

~!~Darksiders 3: Restored- New Content, New Graphics, Morbid Icon, and More!

osnameless: [Designing this post with permission]
I just came back to this thread to celebrate the release of Darksiders 3. I wanted to share some of my favorite memories from the game. This post explains why:
Restored was the first game to use new graphics and graphics from the original Darksiders. The game looked fantastic, but at first there were a lot of frustrations. First, it used a ps1 emulator. Then, it was a game with lots of small things. Now, it was a ps1 game. And finally, it was a game that had a lot of big things and lots things to do.
The main reason I like Restored so much is because it is almost without a mention.
Restored was a sequel of sorts to Darksiders 2. Now, the reason this game was made was because Darksiders 2 used the same engine as Darksiders, but it was truly different. The gameplay was different, the story was different, and the graphics were updated to the point that it was different from Darksiders 2.
But what it did do did not do it any favors. It was buggy, and nothing good was added to the game. But it was well received, so it did not change my mind about its inclusion or the game not working well.
The most notable change I noticed were the new character designs.

But what it did do not do it any favors. It did not improve the gameplay, nor the story, unlike Darksiders 2.
So, here are the things that I think you could notice in the game that made it a positive experience for me (I am talking about the gameplay and graphics)

The game had a lot of little things that made it difficult to decipher.

~!~LTTP: Telltale's The Walking Dead (Spoilers)

BladeoftheImmortal: Been meaning to finish this series for some time, but haven't done anything with it. My last point of this thread is to talk about how much I enjoyed this story. I've had it written all the way through and now have been wanting to finish it. 
What I like
-The characters.
-The evil stalker.
-The exposition.
-The bad guys have a solid group of villains in the back end.
-The Telltale villain (the only good one).
-We get to see the downfall of Clementa's dad.
-The bad guy has a better callow before the fight.
-The dad is actually the good guy.
-The telltale villain is actually a fun character and wearing shades to boot.
-The telltale villain has the most entertaining moments.
-The telltale villain has the most interesting backstory.
-There's a lot more to the ending of the show.
-The gang consists of people that started out as bad before came to light.
-The telltale villain has a group of friends to their credit.
-Buddy is the best bro.
-The brother that Clementine meets at the bar.
-The good twin brother.
-The good twin brother has a large collection of baddies to fight.
-The telltale dwarf has a unique weapon.
-The telltale twin brother still has a brother named H to fend for him and don't have him with you.
-The telltale twin brother is the final villain and the final one to face down H.
So now I'm on the last episode. I'm just playing it as I was originally going to finish the first season. 
I'm a sucker for this series. This past week I've been trying to finish it but behind a bad boss I was unable to do anything.

~!~What are your favorite games in the series?

duckroll: For me it has to be FF7. I mean I've played every one of the games in the series. I've played the first game and then then followed up with 12 before jumping to 15. I've played 15, 16 and I can only remember one game in total in 15, so I'm obviously missing something. I'm not even sure of what the games look like, but I liked 15 and 16 a lot. I could have just been following the story and not really enjoying it as much as I did with 15. I've also seen a little bit of 16 so I guess I'm not too disappointed.
-----
Geno: I always want to play 8, but I never have time to play all the games.
-----
SOLDIER: I loved 13 and don't have the time to dedicate to 4, but I also enjoyed 14 and 15.
-----
FiXalaS: 12
15
FFXIII
-----
Pasokon Deacon: 12 for me. I played 13 in my high school days going back to the PS1, and it was a god game for me. I had a ton of fun with it, and even longer play sessions helped me unwind.
15 on the other hand, I actively prefer it over 14 and 15, to be honest. I played that damn trilogy on my own queue, and I can't believe I have more played with friends and people I enjoy.
-----
Magnet_Man: I don't have time for all of them, but I still love them all. FF9 was my fav in 13, and I still don't have the time to play FF7 in its current state.
-----
Oliver James: The only one I played was the SNES version of WW. It was a bit long ago, so i have no time today.
-----
SolVanderlyn: 16. I played through it with my girlfriend. It was the first FF we had together.
-----
Ravelle: I was playing XIV over the summer and it was the first time I ever played a FF since the PC one.

~!~How do you feel about "A" button being "stamped" based on your gamertag?

ghibli99: I'm playing Sekiro, and I'm a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb. Bumping on this idea because I've been playing for about three and half hours now.
I've played Sekiro, and there's no difference to either party in terms of what buttons you can press based on what gamertag you are playing with in this game, but for me, it's different. You can never be sure what you're supposed to do when you're playing a game like this, and now that I've seen so much about the controls, it's a bit hit and miss. Like, I know I can't hold my character forever, why even do that? "B-but I can't hold the button until I beat the game" is a dumb defense, because you can start a game and do a lot better, but then you get to a point where you don't know what the hell you're doing, and you kind of have to start over. But I don't think that's necessarily the best or the most efficient way to do it.
Like, you can only press A if you beat the game, but you can't press B if you play Sekiro and you can't press A if you play Sekiro. You can't just press A, you have to start over if you wanna play the game the way you want to. I really don't like this, and it's not the first time I've had this happen.
I understand that the "stamped" gamertag problem comes from doing a gamename all the time. It's a form of bullshiting, and it's not really the easiest to get rid of. I do understand that this is not an elegant way to make a game easier, but I never had this problem for something as complex or intricate as Dark Souls.
How do you think some people are supposed to handle gamemodes based on what gamemodes you have? Ones that play the same gamewise, but can't beat the same gamelike gamename? Ones that beat the same gamename, can beat the same Gamename when beat by another player, etc.
I can't really explain it because I can't really remember the tutorial text, but I just think I have to do a gamename all the

~!~The Twitch Prime Beta is over

Created a new thread to try and get a better idea, if you can wait a bit for the beta, but I guess there's no chance.

Durante: Well, not much really.
The Twitch Prime Beta is still open.

TheRaidenPT: I just saw that. Kinda glad they're open. I wanna try Prime.

DriftingSpirit: I don't think I've seen this on Prime Beta.

Ex-Actarus: I have the same client as you.
However, I will be playing as someone who can't play the twitch prime matches.
With that said, I will probably wait, for now.

Fat4all: i think the point is that it’s up to the developers to decide.

texhnolyze: They're already working on the game, there's nothing to see here. 
It's not their job to decide what kind of character they want to create.

~!~Recommendations for a Great Gaming Podcast?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I've been trying to listen to and I don't know if I can make the essential suggestions that fall under the "best gaming podcast" umbrella.
It should be a synonym for social, interactive, and social entertainment.
I think I'm trying to limit what I'm/single people or what I enjoy listening to on my podcast to an hour a day.
-----
Cess007: Don't really know any of these, but Life is Strange, the new Netflix show, seems like a good fit
-----
PucePikmin: Life is Strange and the new Netflix show are both good suggestions I could listen to for an hour total.
-----
saenima: I'm gonna go with Life Is Strange.

Oachkatzlschwoaf: I’d go with Life is Strange.

JKuchter: The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Stranger Things podcast.

Aokiji: I’m sorry Era but Life is Strange and Life Is Strange is the new Netflix show.

~!~Feels like cheating to me.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): And I don't think I'm going to be getting banned for it.
This is, uh, Fortnite.
Nothing is 100% realistic in this game. 
This is Fortnite cross-play. 
I've been playing Overwatch with my roommate for more than two months. We're basically running in pretty solid win-win situations where we're having fun and don't get punished for it. We're just having a blast talking and doing nothing to make a difference.
My roommate is playing Fortnite, and she's playing Fortnite cross-play. She's loving it.
I'm not sure if this is cheating or not, but I'm conflicted.

Jaded Alyx: nah, there's a chance it'll ban you and cause server issues.

~!~What is the best age setting in RPGs?

Porsche: My dad works at a beauty parlour and I once went to for our house when we went to Christmas Town for a holiday. He said it's the best for kids and they're happy that they can stay home. 
My dad works part time so we had the whole lot of free time with my brother and I playing games such as Minecraft and Super Bomberman R. My mom works part time too but we wanted to get something to take her away for the holiday and she described how her work is the best way to stay with me. 
So I ask her what the best age to be with this, she says the 50 and 60 and 70 and 80. So I guess it depends. She says to not wait for the next generation to play video games. 
She also says to take her as much of the time as she can and try not to get bored every day. She says to not get too much studying. 
She says to play games until she is at home is the best way to remain connected to my brother. 
She says to not get too much time at work because we only have 2 phones so we can't play multiplayer games. 
She says to not get tired on weekends and to not worry so much because we have more free time. 
She says to not go outside because I'll start to get bored so we both have a lot of free time. 
She says to not get anxious because we have more free time. She says to not get anxious because I'll be there for another 30 minutes or something. 
She says to not worry so much because we have more free time. 
She says to not get nervous when playing video games. She says to not get nervous when playing video games.

I used to work at a beauty parlour where kids and older people were staying for the day, and they would charge us for the day itself, usually we would order anything, but now I'm getting younger and younger, I'm not sure when I'll start, it may be a few months, or maybe a few

~!~What does everyone care about in a game's development cycle?

Thewonandonly: So I'm talking about the process of making a game. A game will be made if it's well made and if it’s a game people want to see develop for it. It can be on the back of its release and may or may not be made by the devs themselves. It can be on the back of its release and may not be made by the people who spent so much time in the game. Can I have an opinion? I think the poll can help answer some questions. 
EDIT: I’m talking about the game being made and whether or not it counts as an “advance question”

Phantom Thief: I don't think anyone has ever said that, unless they mean that people make games for you.

~!~LTTP: Skyrim Special Edition -- Wild West feels like a taken on

More_Badass: I’ve played the game for about three months, and the first thing I noticed is how even in Skyrim there is an emphasis on wilderness, and it’s a game that wants to move away from that and let you run wild and don’t have to worry about guards chasing you around
...this is something else, Wild West.
I am so in.

sambills: wow i love you modding guides

ThiefofDreams: Wild West is one of my favorite games ever. Skyrim is just so good.

VorpalNonsense: Skyrim is definitely Wild West. I haven't been in this game in years, but it's always a treat to run in and see what mods and stuff there was that I missed out.
This is probably the best Wild West experience I've had in a while.

Phantom Thief: I predict the Switch will sell as many as 100 million units this fiscal year

Nemesis162: But what are you basing that on a sale price of it at a store

Hero of Legend: It was a sale price of $150,000 in Australia. So yes, they're somewhere in the region of 100k-200k though.

KrigareN-: I feel like I remember this from my time of being a kid.

KoolAid: It was just announced, not announced... But yeah, the story in this game is pretty uneven. They need to add a ton of stuff, in the end it's going to be a game with a lot more content.

Kain-Nosgoth: wasn't this game announced before XV was out?

~!~The Best Gaming Podcast (and other good gaming podcasts)

Pitchfork: Over the past few months, there have been many great gaming podcasts, both good and bad, that have made me discover podcasts more and more. I have enjoyed a lot of other games and have tried numerous live gaming podcasts, but I feel like I’m going through the wrong tracks. 
I cannot abide by the format or the content of any of these podcasts. They are all bad, and they need to be LESS BAD. 
Let’s start with the first podcast from Easy Allies. 
They are an embarrassing pairing, and their attempts to sell you a game that you have not played was laughably dull. I don’t know if they were ever going to re-release the game, but they’re still bad. 
I listen to them on YouTube and listen to them on Podcasts (I sometimes use the YT Chats for a good chat, but that’s about it). They are so phoned in and low quality I can’t risk myself listening to them podcast. They don’t have any exclusive content, and they even tried to make an episode of E3 this year, which I could very well be a fuck up. 
Does anyone else listen to these regularly?
-----
Mazzle: Well, I mean, I listen to them every E3, every year.
I don't care about the format and their content at all.
-----
LukarWuff: Isn’t this one of the things I dislike about the whole podcast?
I like to listen to the Easy Allies podcast, but I just find their podcasts boring to listen to.
-----
Grapezard: I guess the Easy Allies podcast is more popular on the podcast than the podcast.
-----
Svart: The Easy Allies Podcast is much more accessible and has somewhat similar issues to the Easy Wolves ones.
-----
Toumari: I really like the Easy Allies ones.
-----
Psychotron: I love Easy Allies, but I’m pretty tired of them lately. They have a great podcast though.
-----
Oheao: I don't really listen to EasyAllies, I listen to the Easy Allies ones every year.
-----
Arebours: I listen to the EasyAllies podcast every year
====================
~!~5 years ago, the PS3 was launched

Cess007: On October 30th, 2006, we just got another great PS3 game.
It was Uncharted 4, iirc.
It was also Uncharted Lost Legacy.
The game was PS3 exclusive, but it did it's best to attract the mainstream.
It was very, very good, tons of content on it.
It had one of the most beautiful looking PS360 games, with stunning graphics.
It had one of the best open worlds ever, with beautiful, varied, and atmospheric cutscenes and areas.
It had one of the most fun and beautiful and atmospheric PS3 worlds to explore.
It had one of the most well developed third party open world games ever, with excellent writing and characters.
It had one of the best DLCs ever, with cool side quests, cool locations, and memorable moments.
It had one of the best videogame endings ever, with the very end.
It had one of the best final moments ever, with the True Ending.
It had one of the best sequels ever, with the very end.
It had one of the best first party exclusives ever, with great writing and characters.
It had one of the best gaming communities on Resetera, to a pretty wide variety of gamers and general internet opinion and discussion.
It had the best integrated console (remember, not a hacked console, just a PS3), it had a great library of PS2 games, many of which got translated, and it had the best secret message ever.
It had one of the most active and dedicated psN communities at the time, lots of positive discussions and even negative ones online, lots of free rpgs, and a fast and active community for discussion.
It had some of the most polished and most active servers ever, and it had an amazing mascot, the PS3.
Finally, at the end of the 5-year anniversary, the PS3 got a new console, the PS4, and a sequel.
Although the PS3 was still alive and kicking, it suffered a lot and fell into obscurity and obscurity- the same can be said for the PS4, and it was just ended before it was even a viable competitor.
PS3 games in particular suffered a lot, specially after Uncharted Lost Legacy and The Last of Us.
And the PS4 had a pretty big following, mostly because
====================
~!~What the hell is going on with RDR2

The-JUV: I know it's been almost 3 years since I played it and I still feel like my time with it is worth more than just riding around and goofing off in the open world.
For those that did it back in the day, what the fuck happened? Was it going to rain, sleezers and droughts, Mad Max season and all that? I mean, I remember RDR2 having absolutely horrendous weather systems, weather that turned to shit in the summer months, huge variations in wind and rain all around you and in your camps, huge gusts and such.
I mean, its still November 22nd and the game is still kicking? How the fuck did this happen? Did the weather system completely break and ruin the game? I mean, I legit want to play it, but I'm also just scared as hell.
I mean, if you play Red Dead, you know the game is coming up to a big open spoilers, but even with that knowledge, you have to wait until its all over. Having to wait all day at a campsite would have killed the pacing the game was trying to provide.
Now, I know that I probably shouldn't have even been thinking about this, but I just know that Red Dead is by far the most anticipated game for me. It has the potential to be GOTY contender. Yet, it doesn't seem to have pulled the player in at all.
I've heard the exact same sentiment before. People point to GTA V as an example of a game that, despite its flaws, is still an extremely fun experience. However, yet, despite having the best weather system and the best weather, the game seems to have pacing issues.
One of the most frequent complaints I see is just how long the game takes to get going. I'm guessing this is a result of people not wanting to rush the game and instead want to enjoy a different time period.
I'm not even sure why this is a problem that I have, but it really does irk me that much.
-----
Cess007: I was never interested in this, but I read there was an excellent article about what happened to the game. There was a lot of talk about the game being too long, but I guess it was just a case of the release being too rough.
-----
The-JUV: Ah yes

====================
~!~Which of the following is the best: The original trilogy, Return to Arkham, or The last of Us?

ToddBonzalez: I stumbled upon the Arkham Knight trilogy discussion and got really lost in them, and thought they’d finally give me my answer.
The first trilogy, when released, is a collection of the first three Batman games, with a third game added in the middle. The first trilogy is a mix of third person and first person view enhanced for first person. It’s the game that got me interested in 3D graphics after watching a GameCube Batman rip of the opening scene. The game’s title is a reference to the upcoming third game in the Arkham series.
The last of us, which was released in 2015, is a collection of the first two games. Like the first trilogy, it’s a mix of first and second person perspective. It goes into some really dark places. The title of the first trilogy is a reference to the portrayal of Lee and her child-groom by Bruce Mac as well as the infamous Peter Jackson movie.
Which of the following should I play to confirm that I’m in for Arkham City?
A. Return to Arkham City:
B. Return to Arkham City:
C. Return to Arkham Knight:
D. The Following is the First Movie
E. Return to Arkham Knight:
-----
chandoog: The first trilogy is a mix of third person and first person perspective.
It's the same for the other games.
-----
MrConbon210: I’m gonna say The Last of Us. I think it’s the better of the two but I think that’s biased as it’s the only game in the trilogy and it’s a third person game.
-----
Omar310: Both of these will definitely be worth playing, especially since you're describing the third game as being a third person game.
-----
MrConbon210: On one hand, I know what you are talking about. If you want to play the first two games and not to mention the other two but the second trilogy, wait for the VR version of the third game.
-----
Bansai: Arkham Knight is a mix of third person and first person perspective, it's not really a first person game.
-----
Omar310: I’d be willing
====================
~!~I want to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

DarknessTear: I have 100% interest to play this game. It's my first Zelda game and I have played every single Zelda game in the franchise. I've played the opening sequence of BOTW and I've only played a few dungeons. I've never gone back to the main dungeons and I didn't even go back to the mountains. And I'm not sure anything's been said about them.
I know the game has dungeons but I just want to ask what are the best ones to go through. I know they're small and varied and all I want is 100% efficient combat. 
I know the most dialogue options are from OOT, but I'm also sure there are some other voiced protags too. I want to go through the ones I've seen and read about.
I know the dungeons are shit but I'm also certain I've seen and heard all of them. 
I know I'm not the only one, and I know all the possibilities. I also have no clue about what happens in them and what I'm actually going to be doing. I know there are different routes available in the dungeons, I know there are different weapons, I know the stamina system is different, I know there is a story mode. I also know I'm supposed to fight the same dungeons twice and I know the story will be different. I also know the map is divided into dungeons, I know there are optional areas where you can go off-trail, and I know there are different magic-based classes. I also know there are no shrines or post-game fetch quests or Korok seeds. 
I'm not sure I understand what the big deal is. I want to go through all the dungeons, maybe read a summary of each one and maybe finally beat the game. I have no clue. 
That's why I'm asking you, Era, if you have any quests, what quests and what advice you would and have for me in this quest.
-----
DarknessTear: I understand. I don't think I understand the biggest quest. 
I'm trying to be a good Zelda fan.

I don't think I ever played the story, but in a dungeon, you can choose the least complicated of

~!~What’s your favorite fighting game track?

Crazy Izanagi: Alright many of you know about the Halo music video but what I want to know is what’s your favorite fighting game song?
For me it’s a really perfect one. Halo music is just perfect. It fits the tone of the games the best. It’s a beautiful song and I love it.
What do you think?
-----
KillLaCam: It's mrmav with a sounwave track
-----
Frecklestein: Its a single beat remix of "Nothing is Perfect"
-----
Philly Cheesesteak: It’s not the best Halo music but its catchy.
-----
CaviarMeths: Its great, but unfortunately the production values aren't what I'm impressed by.
-----
Tricky I Shadow: Its not even remotely a contest, its the same concept.
The Halo 1 soundtrack was the best one.
-----
Kouriozan: When the Halo music video is used as a "let's play" genre, sometimes it’s the best one as well.
-----
Frecklestein: Yeah, I made the same thread a while ago. It doesn't have to be the best, but good music with good production values and fitting music to it will win.
-----
SofNascimento: I guess this could be compared to rap? I like the style of the music but the beats and beats in the video are in a blur to me.

Crazy Izanagi: So I’m finally getting back into Monster Hunter!
I’m wondering what my favorite is.
I’m calling it because it’s the Golden Axe of Genocide:OSS.
Persephone is my number and I’m about to play it.
So what’s yours?

TheInfinityGauntlet: My favorite is the one with the kusari’s asshole dad head

Platy: The best is ZUN. It's been a long time that the game has not had a goat main character

~!~The next Resident Evil is still to a Ken Otero game

TheGamingNewsGuy: The next Resident Evil is really so good - there isnt a better game out there. But I think it is time Capcom come back to the basics and make a Resident Evil game that is not a reboot. The formula of the first trilogy is timeless - play the first three (0 and 3), then move on. 
But why is Ken not a Resident Evil game? For how he can pulled off the formula even for a reboot - it is not just a RE game but is an action game too. And while Ken is cool with kicking Chris' ass, I think his return as the protagonist will be a bigger surprise. I mean he had the good heart of a man when he died 10 years after Chris, and I can see him being the RE Protagonist again. Of course he will be like Nemesis - but I think he will have the good heart of a man again.
Was Ken a good RE player? He seems like a nice guy in 4 but he isnt a main RE character.
Also I dont think a Resident Evil game will be as good as RE3. It will have a lot of the things you describe and probably a lot of the unique features of the original trilogy. But I think it will be a good game nonetheless.
-----
SofNascimento: It's time for a RE game with a story and characters I think similar to the 3rd Remake. 
Make it stop.
-----
Dr. Caroll: The series needs a Resident Evil with a similar style to the original trilogy. So like the title says, start there.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The series has to get rid of the tropes that characters go through and start anewman with new graphics, sound and a story that doesn't take a backseat.
-----
SnatcherHunter: Because of the lack of action.
You have to play The Evil Within 1 and 2 to answer the question.
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: I have a hunch that if RE2make has a similar atmosphere to the first one I can see the positive aspects. It probably will be a great addition to the series.
-----
SnatcherHunter: I dont think 3 Remake will be as good as RE3
-----
TheGamingNewsGuy: The next RE is going to be a franchise with roots in

~!~Rumor: Is Sony planning on a PS5 announcement, or just a PS5 for the holidays?

Mercenary09: Just saw this on the PS Blog website.
Sony has been hinting at possible hardware announcements for the next generation. Now we know that they don't have a large new line up of first party games ready to go. Then we get this.
Sony is supposedly planning on releasing a PS5 in 2020. So we can expect them to announce a launch date and possibly a possible when the PS5 launches.
Sony has been teasing the PS5 by putting out new games every month, and even September they did this and it was good business. Now it looks like Sony is planning on a PS5 announcement, but it is likely that they will make it a holiday console just like Xbox. It's also possible the PS5 will support games up to PS4.
I think this is a very good way to get people who don't game in mind and a PS5 just to make their holiday shopping. They could even launch a new core model in the fall, and a new VR device just to carry that message on. They could even launch a crossplay console just to carry that message on too. With Sony having a huge digital presence in the world and the momentum for crossplay on consoles massively up, it's time to have a serious talk about a PS5.
-----
Lackless: I'm not sure what you mean by 'a Holiday console announcement' but you could be onto something.
-----
X1 Two: I think it would be announced at PSX or PSX 's E3 (or as they say on the internet, PSX).
-----
Jade1962: Sony should buy Microsoft.
-----
Mercenary09: I mean yeah they could announce a PS5 announcement and just put out a new game. Sony has a huge digital presence in the world and the momentum for crossplay on consoles massively up, so I think they should just announce a PS5.
-----
Acquiescence: They could just put out a new Uncharted.
-----
Puffy: I'm sure it's coming
-----
Mercenary09: At PSX the event will be holding a PS5 event.
-----
Ricky_R: You can't just announce a thing at a PSX?

~!~How well do you think the Resident Evil Revelations games will sell?

entremet: I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I'm a bit tired of RE4 and 5 and I really want to play those so badly.
However, I'm no longer in the position to answer this question. I've not played Revelations 2 yet, and I've heard some conflicting reports. I've heard some people say the new set of zombies will be less of a problem and more of a marketing ploy, with new models, lighting, textures, etc. However, I don't know if that actually happened.
I don't know. I have heard some people claim the story and lore will be something new, which I don't agree with, but I've also heard some people say the story will be mostly new and different, and that there will be new horror games as well.
So, I wanted to see how well did you think the Revelations games will sell, and what would you say if you said that it does not have as good a launch performance as RE4/5/RE5?
-----
Viking Jesus: I expect the new games to perform better than the originals, but I think they'll launch at a much better launch time than the originals.
-----
Masterspeed: I expect RE4 to sell better than RE5. I really think RE5 will be the best selling game of all time.
-----
Retroarnold: Yeah, I think so. I don't see them breaking records or doing well. I expect the series to sell whatever the hell RE5 gets.
-----
Kamiyouni: I don't think it'll be good enough to carry some franchise all over but it'll sell fine.
-----
Cisce: I think RE5 will launch in the low hundreds of thousands.
-----
StuBurns: I don't think it'll do well.
-----
Phantom Thief: I expect RE4 to do gangbusters.
-----
KZXcellent: I think the new games will be the same but with a twist of the zombies as in the first game.
-----
Dragonyeuw: I think it will be more like RE4/5 with the zombies being the focus. They're more horror themed. With that said, I expect RE5 to be more like RE4 but a lot more of the same. I'd

~!~Would you pay $250 for a new Nintendo Switch GamePad?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): That's the price I'd pay for the latest and greatest handheld. It's my least favorite option. 
I'm not just talking about the hardware. The latest and greatest handhelds are expensive. I don't even care if they're in the $150-$200 range. I value my freedom more than what I get. 
I feel like making this thread to show support for a brand new handheld that I can enjoy my library on. 
The latest handhelds were handhelds before Nintendo even released one. Their UI isn't perfect, sometimes it's not even my favorite, but it's still super functional and great. The latest handhelds, while great, still don't have the same level of functionality and customization to last me right where the Vita did. 
So I ask you, would you pay $250 for a successor to the Gamepad? 
Would you be interested in a handheld that works better with a controller and a touchpad?
-----
Dennis8K: I don't want a handheld that isn't already better.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): That's why I'm asking.
-----
Sevvybgoode: The Switch is a handheld that isn’t just a gaming device. It’s a media device, the greatest counter to books, music etc. It’s a medium that you can use to consume media and is the reason why it's designed as such. It’s why it's hard to play games or make a living etc. It’s why it’s always been a handheld. It’s a small, but premium device that doesn’t have the appeal of television or the mini consoles for its bigger size.
-----
Dennis8K: No, it is a media device.
-----
TheMoon: The Switch is literally the current VGA's.
-----
The Book Keeper: I will pay $250.00 for the Switch one day.
-----
Jaded Alyx: The Switch is intended to replace the TV and movie boxes.
-----
Dennis8K: Yes, of course.

Memento: The question is simple. Which game (or series or genre) did you personally think was most representative most representative to the creator's original vision? 
For me, I personally think Halo 5 is the only game that has me go "Oh hecka this is what I've been dreaming about for so long" in the face of everything that has happened in the past 5 years. For me, personally, I simply do not want to play Halo games anymore.

Wulfric: The answer is the need for perfection.

~!~The Magic of Nintendo

Metanoia Prime: There's this massive and growing market for games, and Nintendo has the best software library in the industry. It's insane.
It's crazy to think that a company that likes to take risks, is one of the best able to realize it, and is constantly working on products that will make the industry better for everybody.
Even Nintendo has a game library that's worth checking out, and it's clear that they are serious about supporting their products.
What are your thoughts on Nintendo and their software line-up?
EDIT: Added a "It's crazy" to end the discussion
-----
Mediking: ???
Well, finally another realy game like Nintendo games.
-----
Luschient: Yeah, I was gonna say that. It's crazy to think that a company that likes to take risks is dead set against anything but taking risks.
-----
BDS: I'll never understand the love of mine for Nintendo. I love them to the core, but the core is missing.
-----
BubbleButt64: I love the idea of a Nintendo store that's not a hub for ports of their old games. Is there a major lack of one in the US?
-----
Cartridge Games: I don’t particularly think they should be promoting their new stuff, it seems like they do a decent number of Nintendo games every year, but the core audience doesn’t seem interested enough yet they’ll at least give a dedicated section for those games, I imagine that’s what they’re wanting for Switch.
-----
Luschient: I agree with you, but I don't really understand why they're not putting the same amount of their old stuff on Switch. I mean, I could be wrong but I don't see this trend for Nintendo being inconsistent.
-----
Cartridge Games: Perhaps the reasons would be ports and the like.
Like other companies, they really love the mobile and browser business, though
-----
Phantom Thief: The fact that they take risks with their own stuff is a very good thing.
-----
Renna Hazel: I think it's awesome. I find their decisions pretty understandable in a case by case basis. I feel like Nintendo would be more willing to embrace the streaming future if they could.

~!~How do you feel about Labo now? I'm curious

CRIMSON-XIII: I've been a big Nintendo fan since the very first games i played. I was introduced to the series with the Gamecube, and the official brand for that is Labo. I went to sime it with the purple Intellivision, and it was mind blowing at the time that you could make your own personal labo from canned organic materials like photos and paper. I had a few friends that had a way to order all of the stuff. I had a way built for playing it at my friend's house and they had a store that was interested in it. I went and bought a few plastic parts to make my kit. I did some searching and about a hundred thousand of internet searching .. and found out that the Labo store had a store that specialized in Labo Kits. So I ended up going into the very Nyko section and picking up a few of the Labo Kits. They went out of stock on the store and i had to buy from there. 
So here I am. I don't want to buy them. I love Labo, but I am pretty bad at building things myself. I am not great at puzzles. I am good at puzzles. I really like them. I like to break things up! I love the variety of puzzle types. I think Labo is great if you just like to explore different stuff. However, I don't know how Nintendo will market Labo for a diverse range of audiences. 
So I wanted to know how Nintendo will approach the next Labo. 
I am not a fan of Labo. I did not know that Nintendo is planning to do a low-cost and cheap version of Labo. I am not a fan of Nintendo. I did not know that Labo was a Nintendo staple. I was not convinced that Labo would work well as a traditional puzzle game.
I am not a fan of the controller. I did not know that Nintendo considers the Gamecube controller integral to its games. I was not convinced that Labo was a traditional puzzle game. I was not persuaded by the existence of labo. 
How do you feel about Labo now?

ronaldthump: Wasn't sure if anyone else was this hyped before the last 2d fallout titles were released and id has had a blast playing the hell out of the latest rpg to the point that it almost feels like a new IP, at least in the AAA space.

Brucey: I don't think I have ever seen a game trailer better than this one. This is amazing

====================
~!~What are your favorite DS Worms?

mindsale: I was hankering to play a Worms game, but I was hankering to play only one. I started to see this turf war game on DS. I slapped it on with Mario and Wind Waker. 
It was an okay game. 
But it doesn't help that the best is...
Gargoyle's Quest. That game had some nifty shit going on. So good. 
I didn't intend for my 3rd player to play Worms. I didn't intend for my first player to play Worms to have fun. 
I remember playing the demo in the arcade, and it was fun, but I thought the demo was a lot smaller than it needed to be. I think it was like 1 or 2, but I guess I didn't realize that it was 2 people at the table. It felt like a 3 on 3 mission, which I can't remember. 
I remember the first time realizing I was playing a Worms game. I was like "Wow! I might actually try this." The first few times I saw it, I had the impression that it was a relatively small table, maybe 2 people, but that was just so off in my head. 
I mean, I got into it, I liked it, but it wasn't something I wanted to experience for a long time. 
I think I might've snuck it into the DS, but I thought it was a little too much for me, and I ended up playing a lot of Mario Maker instead, which I consider a great game. 
Which is why I found it so surprising I wasn't playing it more: It was so weird. 
What are your favorites?
-----
Weiss: The two Worms games are the most fun I've ever had with a 2-in-1 table, and they're both perfect for guests like you.
-----
mindsale: I love Worms. I'm not sure if my eyes can comprehend the incomprehensible sound that is a Worms.
-----
Weiss: I love the Worms. I love the Castlevania games. I love the first two games. But the first two games are better if you don't mind the weird shit you hear in the background.
-----
HylianSeven: I've always been fond of Castlevania games, but I've never
====================
~!~Was the 3D Blast 2 coming out of nowhere this time?

delete12345: (Satire reference)
What, exactly, is this game?
-----
Omar310: I love shit like this.
-----
delete12345: Ohhhhhh, thanks for sharing.
-----
Garrett 2U: I thought this was the same game with 3D Blast and Dead Cells?
-----
Garrett 2U: No, but it was announced as Dead Cells on the same day as the game.
-----
delete12345: Ah. Okay.
-----

====================
~!~I miss N64 Classic Mini

Phediuk: I really miss the N64 classic, it was such a perfect game for the time, with it being the perfect combination of PS1-Genesis-style hardware and the perfect arcade-level of smooth, precise analog locomotion. It was, as always, the perfect game.

====================
~!~[Gematsu] Lord Fries leaves Sony Interactive Entertainment (Sony Interactive Entertainment)

LordFries: 
-----
Blablurn: Leave Sony with the worst PS1/PS2 era game lineup
-----
Aokiji: Sony is doomed.
-----
Toumari: Lord Fries.
-----
LordFries: There's a video on it.
-----
brokeastronaut: Unless Sony pays him $150k back, I'm done for the rest of eternity.
-----
GhostTrick: Lord Fries
-----
Tofer: He’s leaving after paying $300K?
-----
LordFries: Fries isn't really leaving.

~!~Everspace: Stellar Edition launches February 21

Novus: New trailer, new release date: February 21
​
-----
GavinUK86: I was hoping for a new Everspace trailer. Now I am not.
-----
Truant: I've had my eye on this one for a while, looks interesting.
-----
GavinUK86: Wow, that's really good. I've never heard of the game before now. I've looked up some footage but it looks pretty rough and I don't know how to motivate myself to keep playing.
-----
GavinUK86: Added it to my library.
-----
GavinUK86: Yup, I just re-installed it.
-----
GavinUK86: I love the story.
-----
Agrizzlyadventure: Looks great, just waiting for reviews myself
-----
Masterspeed: I thought this was the very first Everspace was released?
-----

====================
~!~Asphalt 9 is 9.99 on the Humble Store now!

HardRojo: Just saw this on the Humble Store and it's "unavailable" for purchase now:
And it's not listed in the store's description and I wish I had known that by now.
Pricing? I'm confused. I submitted a ticket for the game a few days ago, but no luck then.
-----
Slayven: I tried playing it, but I was so ready for it to be worth my time
-----
KoolAid: It's unavailable? I thought it was up for preorder at Best Buy until April?
-----
gcwy: I don't think a relatively dry campaign pulled this off. The only thing it could have done was wait for reviews.
-----
Slayven: I forgot how buggy this game was. Was it this bad?
-----
Paz: I was very interested, but I got confused and held my nose at trying the game for weeks. This came out a day or two after Best Buy was having it up until the release date.
-----
Slayven: I have to be honest. I was hoping to get everything for as cheap as possible
-----

====================
~!~LittleBigPlanet Crossover DLC announced

-----
RochHoch: This is the best Zelda DLC.
-----
NoKisum: Pretty much.
-----
ZeoVGM: I remember when I was playing this and seeing all the new outfits. I want to be able to wear some of those good outfits.
-----
Mediking: Wait, the other DLC characters aren't in this, right?
-----
TheMoon: yes
-----
NoKisum: yup
-----
mjc: Gonna be bought at launch.
-----
Zalman: I'm assuming they're just referring to the voices from the DLC.
-----
Neoxon: In general, I feel the DLC characters seem to be the weakest Link & Zelda & Therion. The rest of the DLC is quite good.
-----

====================
~!~Doesn't Fortune 64's new game have a way to play with a native iOS controller?

Tizoc: I'm in the mood for some unique experiences or a new experience that doesn't require using a controller.
The new game that springs to mind is Fortune 64, but I'm wondering if it's also on the same level.
I'm sure there was some iOS controller homebrew scene for 64 before, but who knows if that's still active.
-----
GusZamboni: nope, i think its on the beta
-----
fantomena: Yes, I tried it once and i was happy, though I think I deleted it and never went back.
-----
Tizoc: I remember a while back when it was on iOS devices, but I've since moved over to PC.
-----
Megatron: There isn't. It's like comparing Poker and Blackjack to golf.
-----
Megatron: Never heard of it, but it reminds me of Kaiju games.
-----
Rhomega: It's running on iOS devices and not phones?
-----
2n2: The best part about Fortune is you can play it with both a controller and the mouse and you can get a ton of different custom rules and events.
I'll be playing on a controller and will play either as a normal player or on a mouse/keyboard.
-----
2n2: Yes. It's actually on iOS, but not on PC.
-----
Risev: Yeah, I was in the same boat. I thought the game would be great and I'd love it... but then I realized I really didn't like the controls and it was really hard to get used to. I ended up getting it on iOS.
-----

====================
~!~Is there a place for competitive fighting games in a genre that doesn't require it?

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): I've never played a fighting game. Never felt like I had. I've played a lot of MOBA's I've played fighting games. But none of them have had competitive play. I've never played MOBA's that don't require it. I'm wondering if there's a place for it in a genre I'm unfamiliar with where I can play something with minimal effort that isn't just a "fighter" game.
I understand that it doesn't require it as a genre, but would it be cool if a fighting game could add something to genres I don't necessarily consider fighting games?
-----
DGenerator: It used to be called MOBA.
Now it's Street Fighter.
-----

Jawmuncher: Maybe you should have said "Street Fighter" instead of "MMO".
-----
TheRedSnifit: Smash.
-----
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): Well, I'm not sure if that's the intent or not.
-----
Jintor: I think Smash is the only game that makes sense to call it a MOBA. That's why I'm asking about any MOBA games.
-----
Syril: It's Smash bros.
-----
Neptonic: It's Street Fighter.
-----
Phil32: Dragon Ball Fighter Z is the only fighting game I can think of that makes sense to call it such. And it makes more sense to call it a MOBA than a MOBA.
-----

====================
~!~Cuphead fans, do you ever get the Japanese message of getting out of the fight?

Memento: I am about 10 hours into this game and I literally cannot stop laughing, I seriously can't even beat the first 10% of the game. I literally started to sing songs to my heart "NO!! No!!"
I know, silly stuff but I really love when I am fighting and I get a message in this game, it really puts me in the Fortnite mood.
It is just such a weird feeling, you just get this message and it plays for like 5 minutes before you do even the slightest bit of fighting, it is just weird.
What are your favourite moments?
-----
KZXcellent: The first fight against Amy in Soul Calibur 2 is pretty much when you get a message.
-----
soulzonik: The first fight to get the Platinum in Mega Man X.
-----
roguesquirrel: The first fight to join us on the Great Ape Wars -_-
-----
MisterHero: The first fight to beat the first boss in the first goddamn place.
-----
LossAversion: I get stuff like this everytime I play a new game. I feel like I am playing a video game.
-----
Y2Kev: I get so sick of the final boss' theme in Tales of games.
-----
Omar310: Spider-Man 2 pitting himself against a pan-tossing Spider (who by the way has his own theme) in the opening scene of the season 1 game was... weird.
-----
Dreamboum: Amongst my all-time favorite moments is when I was playing as a kid in the original Resident Evil, and I had a mission where you had to save everyone in the Asylum.
-----
Soul Lab: Persona 5 opening mission theme
-----

====================
~!~What's the best game intro (preferably theme song)

yuoke: Personally, i really like the intro from bokchao bong and it's super fun to listen to.
So i was wondering what the best intro was.
-----

CannonFodder52: Wrong thread. 
I think it's the GOAT:
-----

Usyren: KH2
-----

Kuro: KH1's is great. I like the music
-----


====================
~!~What is your favorite RPG dungeon?

GiantEnemyCrab: I've been playing a lot of DQXI lately and I haven't really gotten into the dungeon design, but I recently got back into it and started over, with some Doom Garden set in Traverse Town. It's a modern take on the classic dungeon design from the golden age of the JRPG.
I like the boss battles, the maps are a mix of old and modern, the puzzles are pretty much just overkill (as they are in my opinion, using the same framework and ideas) and the boss fights are challenging and have a display mechanism for one.
The dungeons have a really great feel to them, with a distinct atmosphere and smart puzzles for the most part. The boss battles are mostly standard and time consuming (I can't remember the names of the dungeon puzzles, but I recall the most interesting and boss battles are the boss fights), but I like the puzzles and have a fun time with them.
I also have nostalgia for the area from Chrono Cross, so that's a plus.
I love the interconnected world and the music.
-----
Man God: Suikoden 3 has the best dungeon.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: I like
Spoiler
-----
Parfait: I'm gonna say that the only real ones I like are:
Erebonia, at least those few that aren't ancient history reploids.
Path of the Abyss
Etc.
-----
Cisce: The one that I never actually beat.
But I think I've played:
Path of Mana
Path of Wind
Path of Chaos
Path of Chaos 2
Erebonia/Erebonia 2
Both are great dungeons, and I can't recommend them enough.
-----
Xavi: I love the places you see in Eorzea.
-----
Soulflarz: If you have a PC already, get this game
-----
Pygrus: I'm playing it right now, and I'm having a hard time finding the time.
What's made me think this recently is that the dungeons in the area seem to have a 4x rating. I mean, I know there's a big gif showcasing the exact same scenario in a 2D image, but I can't remember which. The gameplay in the post game says otherwise.

====================
~!~Catherine Full Body Devs Confirmed to Play The Final Countdown

TheDanger: May as well drop the Half Minute Shorties, this is a sequel to Full Body with a better ending/open ended story because the girl is too young.

~!~What's been your favorite in-game trailer?

Memento: We are almost here! What was your favorite in-game trailer? The one in the OP was pretty dope.
-----
Zeno: I remember when I was playing God of War, and saw the Uncharted 2 Nier trailer. I thought it was a great trailer.
-----
Flux: I remember seeing the E3 trailer for Ni No Kuni when I was like, "this looks pretty dope" and it just did.
-----
the_wart: Basically everything from the Halo 1 trailer. The music, the style, the way it all fits together.
It's a trailer.
-----
Rodjer: The one with

Dennis8K: The one in the OP.

Flux: "What is it that looks so good that it makes you want to play it again?"

inky: The one in the OP.

Jonneh: Finally some gameplay!
-----
Pottuvoi: Just saw the trailer. Game looks good.

WonderLuigi: I hope this game does well. I need this game.

Dark Cloud: I want this game.

MauroNL: DLC trailers?

Pottuvoi: They did on PC

Theorry: ??

====================
~!~So what's the deal with Windows 10 and Xbox One X?

mindsale: I was just gifted a Xbox One X and I'm on the hunt for a "real" pc next-gen console. 
I'm mainly looking at games that'll draw me in, but I'd be willing to spend $500-700 bucks to get on a PC/XB1X.
I'm not expecting to get an experience that game development can't handle, but I'm looking for a certain kind of console that will not give me pause.
-----
icespide: you mean xbone?
-----
Kraken3dfx: I have an X1X and I've done everything possible on it. It's my preferred platform of choice for many purposes, so I'm not sure why you're not looking at me.
-----
bananafactory: PS4 Pro. I would not consider it a port, but it is pretty good, and it would be nice to have an option for a PC with native 4k
-----
Kapryov: I have my PS4 pro and X1X hooked up to my Switch, but I'm not sure if I'd use either of them for gaming.
I will not consider xbox or switch as ports, and wouldn't discount those at all.
-----
Deleted member 15538: W10 is far far far more powerful than the other consoles.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Since I've been plugged into my PC I'm not sure what I would pay for. I can't think of anything I'm interested in that I have no reason to go for.
-----
Kraken3dfx: Wishlist on the Xbox main store if you want to wait until the next generation if you don't want to spend extra money.
-----
Mikeside: Does my Xbox need to be 1080p/720p/60?
-----
Duxxy3: I have an X1X. I'd be interested in a port.
-----

====================
~!~What's your favorite Zelda game?

SantaC: We are in a pretty great timeline with some amazing games, but which Zelda game do you think is the best is Zelda 1?
I personally feel like Zelda 1 stands at the top of the 3D zelda games.
-----
Nabbit: I'm gonna say BotW. I think it's the best of the series and I love it. However, I think it's the 3D ones because they added a lot of new things to the formula (e.g. the skill tree) and the dungeons are more linear than BotW.
-----
SantaC: No it is not. I just finished the 4th one.
-----
KtotheRoc: I'm gonna say Nes, but that game was so bad.
-----
Masterspeed: OoT it's the best. I don't really think either one has topped Majora's Mask.
-----
SantaC: Yeah I was thinking about it before posting and I'm okay with that. However, I'll say Zelda. I think the 2nd half of the game is the best in the series.
-----

====================
~!~Leaked EA Dead Space posters and info

Deleted member 1378: The Dead Space franchise is one of my favorite franchises ever and everytime i think about it i remember the first time this happened. So i wanted to share this leak and see if anyone knew something i might have.
Feel free to lock this thread or make a post on discord if you wish.
-----
Deleted member 1378: Ah, cool. I think I'll start the thread off. I wouldn't expect anything different from the EA I've been following for a long time and this is just a second screen image.
-----
Shao Kahn: Holy shit! That was really cool and cool.
-----
Cow Mengde: That's some awesome stuff!
-----
Deleted member 1378: I too was sad to learn about this.
-----
soul: That's crazy. I always figured EA would be cool with this stuff, but this is neat too.
-----
Saucycarpdog: That's cool.
-----
Vicious17: Damn. I really want to play this!
-----
Deleted member 1378: That was great. I don't remember the type of games in the game but it is the EA I know
-----

====================
~!~Is this the best time to jump into ace attorney?

Sky87: I've been playing ace attorney on the 3DS recently and it's been blowing me away. I've tried every game in the series and it's the most fun I've had with a DS game in a while.
I've always liked the one on PS2. It's the first game in the series that I can seriously say is "no, this is the best time to play a PS2 game". I don't think it's the best time to jump in, but it's certainly worth a shot and I think it's worth it for the atmosphere, story, and the gameplay. I've had it on my 3DS wishlist and haven't gotten around to it yet.
I was going to get a DS but lost interest after the second case of the first case. Maybe I should try to get a 3DS to replace the DS.
I'm curious to know if other people agree or not.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I think there's only one other entry, which is better.
-----
Dreamboum: Ace Attorney was a revelation and a lot of the best DS games were ported, but I don't think that games are "required reading" for the DS.
Ace Attorney is really good, it's on the DS in terms of portable gaming imo and is €20.
-----
Sky87: I really like the DS version. While I don't remember the 3DS version being that much better, I think it's still worth playing, especially for the 3rd case.
-----
Dreamboum: Ace Attorney is amazing, even better than it's predecessor
-----
Sky87: Hmmm, I guess that's a reason why I have a higher tolerance for slow start ups, but I still very much enjoyed my time with it.
-----
MegaManTrigger: I've been itching to jump in to the DS version, but I've heard the 3rd case is really, really slow and that's why the game is no fun.
Maybe I'll finally give it a shot, but I've heard it's not that great, and it's a shame because it looks gorgeous.
-----
Sky87: Yeah, I've heard that the 3rd case is not that good. I can't speak for the DS version though, I haven't played it.
-----
====================
~!~2 months later, how do you feel about the Switch's first party line up?

Meelow: Nintendo wants to sell 20 million Switches, what do you think?
-----
Cartridge Games: Switch is doing fine so it’s killing all hope for a big new first party line up or anything else
-----
Phendrift: I think they’ll be fine. I’m sure at some point they will reach there target. I’m not expecting a “huge” first party for Switch, but I’m sure that this year’s in a similar way.
-----

pld: I think it's fine. I don't care for exclusives or "big" AAA titles, just because I don't have a ton of money to buy so this is fine.
-----
mazi: yeah.
i think they'll be fine.
-----
Tofer: I’m buying it because I’m a Nintendo fanboy.
-----

====================
~!~Will we ever see a system launch for the Switch?

mutantmagnet: I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Nintendo has become the ultimate handheld of the Switch. The indie hit that it is.
However, there is something that is not exclusive to the Switch that you are missing out on. 
A system launch is still far away for a handheld like the Switch. They may not launch it with the greatest of titles but they will be adding titles that people would want to experience.
I realize this is not a serious topic but I want to hear your thoughts on this.
-----
Cartridge Games: Maybe.
It’s pretty late to launch a portable console, but it’s possible.
Imagine Nintendo has 3 years to release a new 2DS? Doubtful
-----
Platy: Yes, but only if there are enough people interested in it
-----
Joseki: There's a reason they haven't tried to launch a portable system yet.
-----
Strings: I wonder what people expect with 2DS after the disastrous 3DS launch.
-----
Nanashrew: This is not a serious topic, but I wonder what a 3DS launch could even be like.
-----
Phantom Thief: Yeah, I’m thinking it’d be a waste of 20 million to have the Switch launched with a couple more releases that are fresh and different.
-----
WonderLuigi: no, i think they're just waiting for people interested in handhelds, while not being too difficult to port games to switch.
-----
Piston: I think Nintendo are waiting for adults to buy Switch.
-----
Xavi: It's a joke though.
-----

====================
~!~Fortnite Switch vs PS4 Switch compares - vs PS4 Pro - Early switch version

Savantcore: Source
-----
LewieP: Is it a leak? If not, it's almost certainly a leak.
-----
TheInfinityGauntlet: It's a leak OP, that's not how games work
-----
Toumari: Update, PS4 version has PS4 Pro and Switch.
-----
brokeastronaut: I'm not sure if this is taken seriously or not. I think the Switch version is more accurately called the Early Switch version.
-----
RumbleHumble: Well, there it is.
-----
jariw: Unfortunately it's more of a rumor than anything.
-----
Kolx: I don't see how this is "confirmed" so much as "it's just speculation".
-----
phanphare: this is false as hell
-----
kvetcha: I don't think it's a leak... but I don't think it's worth discussing at all
-----

====================
~!~2K Games to release on Nintendo Switch in Japan

TC13: I saw this pop up on Twitter a while back and it's interesting. It should be noted that both Bandai Namco and Take-Two are self-sustaining companies. They don't need to, but the Switch is still selling phenomenally well despite being in a tough spot in the gaming world.
-----
ASaiyan: So they're releasing both games on the same day now. Nice.
-----
linkman26: Weird. I thought they were still keeping consistent with PS4 releases.
-----
mrmickfran: They just need to bring the Vita to the west.
-----
skittzo0413: I'm glad they're still releasing on the same day, even if it's the case right now. It's a little odd that because of the PS4, they release in the same timeframe on the same exact day, but I don't know why that's.
-----
TC13: Yeah, I just edited the tweet to clarify. I think they didn't even need to tweet otherwise.
-----
Kenzodielocke: Yeah, they just said it's on the spot now.
-----
Nuclear Muffin: The PS4 version is still in the Christmas period and it runs pretty flawlessly!
-----
Jawmuncher: I'm guessing this is part of the reason why it’s a Christmas release.
-----
mclem: Yeah, I was under the impression that there were more platforms than just the Switch on those two titles. No dice.
-----

====================
~!~Convergence: Xbox One X - Is it worth the $399

EvilBoris: I'm having a hard time getting over this. I know it's a bit pricey, so I thought it was worth the trade in value. Is it worth $399.99?
I've had the X for a bit since I got it as a surprise in a trade for Horizon: Zero Dawn. I'm not a fan of Uncharted 4 but I really like Witcher 3 and I've never been a big fan of Horizon, and it was the last time I played it. I've thought about the thing and I've heard that it's slept too long. What does it do best know as opposed to other flagship X1X devices?
-----
cowbanana: Yes, it is. The first thing you should do is to make a LTTP OT for it. It's a great place to start by learning about what you can expect from a console built for an enthusiast market.
-----

====================
~!~Do you think Nintendo will bother with a "proper" Virtual Console situation again?

Het_Nkik: I feel like it's been a while since we've seen such a thing. I know Nintendo consoles have had complete virtual libraries for over a decade now, but even with the low price of their consoles, they still limited the amount of support they could have. Even with the Wii, they still limited their reach. Even with the 3DS and Wii U, they still limited the amount of people they could get marketing their hardware.
Do you think Nintendo will bother to create a Virtual Console? I think they will. Just look at their catalogue. The most iconic games they developed was Mario Sunshine, they are well covered with games like SMB3, SMRPG, SMTx, SMRPG: Lost Stars and the aforementioned SMTxR. I don't think Nintendo will go back to just remastering these and hoping they can get some back if they go back to the classics.
-----
Cartridge Games: They probably will. They'll just need to get a proper box and a couple more games.
I think they are a Nintendo trademark now
-----
Cartridge Games: They’ll likely just reprint some titles. Lost stars was licensed, but lost some content.
They probably won’t bother to re-release them though since they’re a Nintendo Forever service
-----
Ababol: The only way they'll bother is if they need to reprint the old ones and charge more for them. There's a reason they made so many NES and Famicom boxes, even though they were discontinued years ago. They don't need to reprint discs. They just need to reprint the classics. They don't need to reprint a lot of games, they just need to reprint their classic consoles.
-----
808s & Villainy: I don't think they'll bother to reprint more games. They'll reprint their best selling games but they'll probably just reprint a lot of new games and let the library rot if they want to.
-----
Dreamboum: They'll probably just reprint some titles. There's a reason they made so many NES and Famicom boxes, even though they were discontinued years ago. They don't need to reprint discs.
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: I think they'll just reprint more titles. They're not going to reprint the old ones
====================
~!~Microsoft wants to make stronger choices in gaming

The era of Luigi: Microsoft wants to make stronger choices in gaming. They want to make the best games possible.
They want to make decisions that affect everyone, and they can't make the best decisions.
What do you think about this?
-----
Kolx: They need to make more games.
-----
Chivalry: They're the most open ended company.
-----
CalamityPixel: It's about games and not about money. 
Good job, Microsoft.
-----
Kolx: They're serious about making games.
-----
Dark Cloud: I mean I agree with you.
-----
Kolx: You haven't been paying attention.
-----
Phantom Thief: Microsoft has always been open to experimentation and ideas. It's been that way for a while.
-----
Dark Cloud: You mean like what they did with Crackdown 3?
-----
The era of Luigi: yeah, but they need to make more games and have more control over the development of them
-----

====================
~!~is it okay to pay more for a digital copy of a game you don't want or doesn't want?

Yinyangfooey: I understand that "buy a used copy" is against the rules.
However, if a digital copy of a game is more than 50% off, is it ok for you to pay more, or do you have to pay more, or do you not care?
-----
Brass Body Dave: Yes.
-----
Bhonar: i think it depends what I'm paying. Is it enough for me to pay more?
-----
Sargerus: Yes.
-----
Nights: I mean, if a game is cheaper than a used game, yea. I hate renting games anymore.
-----
Kyoufu: Yes.
-----
Ryuelli: No.
-----
Razlo: Yes.
-----
Bhonar: ok, thanks
-----
FairyEmpire: Usually no, especially if the game has MTX locked in like most PS2 games are usually. I'll generally pay for a used copy, just because I like the space to be able to start playing it without MTX being unlocked.

My answer is pretty much the overwhelming favorite electronic website on there. There's a ton of them, just to be specific.
Or is it all mixed together, Era?
-----
Silky: The biggest gaming forum on earth is the best one.
-----
Kyoufu: All of them.
-----

Jintor: It's mostly mixed together, but a lot of them are in top 10s and even top 10s.
-----
Giga Man: The biggest one is Era.
-----
newyokohama: The best is Era.
-----
OwOtacon: The biggest is Era.

~!~Dark Souls 3: What to do for a Demon Souls fan that bounced off of the game.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°): So I was browsing through my SNES, NES and Genesis games and came across Dark Souls 3. I couldn't believe what a great game it was. The character wise, I think I'm just going to have to go through the game to get an idea of how the game plays. There's a lot of bad guys, a lot of deaths and I don't want to kill them.
I might do a runthrough later this year. I'm really excited, but I'm not sure what I want to do first. I'm a long time fan but I feel like I know everything. I recognize how the game plays like a broken game but I don't want to go back to it with all these cool features. So I'd like to make this thread.
I'm playing through the game and you see an NPC standing next to you. He's talking to some beholder about some kind of demon. He tells you a lot about how he killed that little girl in the forest. He gave you a hammer. He wants you to use that to bring down his spawn box and kill the big ugly demon that lives there. He told you how he fell to his death trying to kill the big ugly demon that lives there. He told you about how he was trying to kill the big ugly demon that lives there. He told you about one of the dead NPC's that was feeding the big ugly demon that lived there. He told you about one of the NPC's that was standing next to you and was killing the big ugly demon that lives there. He told you about one of the NPC's that was standing next to you and was killing the big ugly demon that lives there.
And I don't know. I feel like the game is going to be like a broken mess. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what to do.
It's a game that's at a point here where it's just not for me. I'm kind of looking forward to the next Ys game. I'm not so interested anymore in the franchise.
Anyone else have any advice for a fan who's considering playing Dark Souls?

WrenchNinja: Don't listen to the haters.
There's no reason to hate the game. It's

~!~So I want to play RE2, how would i pass the time without knowing what RE2 is?

Camel: I think it is a great game but I have a lot of questions. I have a couple questions.
1- How do I know what RE2 is?
2- Is there a tutorial?
3- Can I skip the shooting scene? Is there a walkthrough?
I have a PS4 but can I skip the PS4 version and play the original on PS3? Do you think I would enjoy it?
-----
DecoReturns: Ehh... 1?
The first person intro is enough for most. 
2 is pretty bad.
3 is kinda good and you’re probably not missing something.
-----
Mauricio_Magus: I would play it if you want to see the cutscenes and the story and lore bits.
The walkthrough is pretty good, though it is a bit of a bummer that you can't skip it as it's really good.
-----
Paraside: I would say the easiest way to play is with the save system. You can always resupp up your ammo by walking through each room to replenish a save, which is pretty easy to do.
-----
Camel: I couldn't even finish the intro from RE2 on my PS3, haha. I would have hung on for so long to do this.
-----
jcs: It's a pretty simple game, just remember that you can only save after you have a certain amount of ammo.
-----
Camel: I forgot about reloading ammo. I just did the "beat as many missions as you can before recruiting new characters" thing.
-----
hippopotamus: Not for me. I can't stand the graphics or the way the game looks but it's okay.
-----
HockeyGuy412: For me its the shooting scene and you can pretty much do whatever you want in the shootouts The first hour but the second is mindblowing
-----
Duff: The first part of RE2 is genuinely incredible, but the rest of the game is just really poor. There's so many things you can do to make it enjoyable without using the save system, and it's not even just the shooting scene in the first hour. Not to mention the lore bits. If you're just going to do the same thing
====================
~!~Where are my PC/Xbox Gamespass titles?

TheWordyGuy: I have a brief itch for some Xbox games to play, and I'm not sure where to look for the best deals.
I can only find a few titles on PC, and I know that a lot of them are games I already own. I did search the giant site and saw that the best deals were from Steam. 
But I want to know if there are any gems or enhanced editions I should look out for.
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
-----
alr1ght: Recent cloud gaming days have also given us plenty of time to stock up on cloud games.
-----
HeisenbergWW62: There are very few titles you can buy on pc or console. They are mostly indie titles like:
- Rocket League
- Fortnite
- Overwatch
-----
J_ToSaveTheDay: Rocket League is my go-to game for this.
I've heard good things about the Rainbow Six Siege free trial, right?
-----
daxy: I've been hearing for a while that R6 Siege is great value, but I think I'm SUPPOSED to believe it isn't.
-----
TheWordyGuy: Just checked on Amazon UK and there are 2 linear free maps.
-----
Kittens McMittens: I have Origin Access Premier and have been really curating what I want to play and I don't know which ones to look out for.
-----
TheWordyGuy: I was wondering about this myself. I mean, I have the entire damn catalog up on Steam, but I'm wondering if there are any games I'm missing.
-----
Phil32: Hmmm, I wonder what the best deal on a new PC for is all of Madden 19 is. I've read a few places now offer the game for 15% cheaper than purchasing it normally.
-----
TheWordyGuy: Just checked and the best deals are from Steam, I just noticed that the store page only says 25% off and does not list what games it normally costs.

~!~The lack of 'em in Resident Evil 2 Remake is a real bummer

SolVanderlyn: RE7 is a classic Resident Evil game, and it's one of the best games of this generation.
The game is known for having the best pacing and survival horror aspect of the entire franchise. It had two of the best DLCs of this generation, and one of the best reversible cover types.
I don't think I've ever seen a game with such a great sense of continuity as the RE2 remake. REmake 1 is the third game in a series (RE6 is fourth), and RE2 is the last one in a row.
The lack of a memorable antagonist in the main antagonist (Joel, Ada, and Leon) is the biggest drawback. The only person that has more memorable and/or interesting moments is Leon, but the rest is just as memorable.
I guess it can' be said that the 'old guard' (those who hate RE because 'em) is the least interesting part of the game. Resident Evil 2 is probably the most boring and/or boring out there.
The only good aspect of the game is the atmosphere, and the game is a masterpiece.
-----
Khanimus: I don't even understand the comparison.
-----
DocOwer: Yeah, the pacing is just mindblowing.
-----
SolVanderlyn: I think the mistake for you to say that is you actually use RE2 as an example. REmake 1 was a masterpiece, but the pacing was so mind blowing, it was overwhelming. RE2 however is a classic, and it's one of the most atmospheric game ever made.
-----
Shevat: I love just using Leon as the emotional character despite all the crazy shit they've been down to from him over the past 20 years.
-----
Shin-Kisa: I’d say RE2 is the best of the three mainline REs.
-----
Shevat: No it's not, RE2 is the best of the three classic REs
-----
Khanimus: You only use "Classic Resident Evil" when describing the games you like.
-----
RDreamer: RE7 is nothing like RE2R.
It has the best atmosphere and gameplay and the story and characters are the best in the series.
I take it back as a smart move on their part. RE
====================
~!~The perfect dark horse for a Pokemon game

SolVanderlyn: I just finished Nintendoland, which was an excellent remake of a classic, but with some elements that are a little different (fire/earth elemental/moon water/water#).
The game took place in some sort of sub-plotline, and the main character (voiced by an anime-level of mystery, who is voiced by a real-life domestic partner) is on a murder spree. The game's first half is pretty standard "detective" stuff.
The first game has you playing as a boy (with a "shoto" style appearance by the end of it), but the second game goes into a typical horror situation since the first game is a remake of the first game. The first game is set in a prestigious medical school, while the second is in a typical high-technology university. Both games take place within the same campus, but there's a twist to it: the "mysterious man" is actually a "shockwave". The major difference is that the second game goes into the "school setting" for the good of Halloween, and the twist is that the "club" is back and the "peril" is back.
While the first game does have a great final scene, it's the last scenes that really make up the "traps" that were done in the first game. The first scene with Eelektria's Joker is the best part of the game for me, and the one that inspired the second game.
The scene with the two boys (voiced by a "normal" man and a "shoto" character who is a minor plot character) and the old man (voiced by a "normal" man and a "shoto" character) drove all the way to Suddenburg to slaughter the Joker and his family before sending them through Hell.
I don't think there's a game that captures the essence of the first game better, and I think the second game shows up far too late to create a big effect.
What do you think?
-----
Gundam: I think that it's the hook of the second game that makes it so cool to play in a horror setting.
-----
RochHoch: Even though it's the first game, I'd still posit that Hotline Miami is the most chilling and effective video game ever made.

~!~What do you want out of the next RE2?

ToddBonzalez: I'm just in a self-imposed crisis this time. I've barely made it past the first place in RE5 and RE6, but I'd like to see them improve on what RE2 did in some of the areas they touched on. 
I don't want anything to do with Nemesis, but I would like to see him become more of a rival to Leon, who had already been a rival to RE2 for a long time. Nemesis is definitely the perfect contrast to Leon; I just don't know if I want to see him as the "RE4 protag" or someone much more seasoned in RE6.
-----
SirKai: I want a Grizzco.
-----
GavinUK86: Make it the RE4 Remake.
-----
Zombie Fred: A Grizzco.
-----
Weiss: Took a lot of inspiration from the old REs and no one comes close to the original.
RE3 should absolutely be a remake of the first two games with the Nemesis system and it should feature a Grizzco character.
-----
Bishop89: A new entry would be a direct sequel to RE4 so I'm there.
-----
TheBaldwin: Never. 
Resident evil is the black sheep of the franchise, but a critically acclaim remake is the way forward.
RE3 should be a spin off, but not necessarily the next entry 
RE4 should have a full on remake with the original RE3 engine, gameplay reboots, new weapons
-----
Indelible: RE3 should be a remake of the first two REs with the Nemesis system and a full on remake of the first two titles.
-----
Dullahan: I want Grizzco to make another RE game.
