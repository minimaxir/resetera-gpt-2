~!~why does NASA still have mission details missing from astrometric wedding invitations?

ItsBobbyDarin: This.
This is what happens when you put money on a picture, not how the other person made their decision.
I do care about those wedding invitations.
I’m fairly sure I get that the Lord has a bunch of fine people on this planet to photograph in response to Dark. But let’s be clear, the astronomical cost to get them all done effectively in one sitting is more interesting than making a wedding album of photos.

~!~Green Book Debut? Executive Out With Alec Baldwin & Maher Soares to Star

norm9: From Deadline
The executive cast for Green Book not only seems to adore both Old Man and Precious One, Gary Oldman also seems to love The Green Book as well.
I'll be interested in seeing the movie
-----
Bad_Boy: Can’t make me miss the book.
Live fuck you.

RoboPlato: No Golden Globe for me. Maybe I'll check it out.
How will this show up on HBO?

La Flame Amiibo: Two good ass dudes? Holy shit

-PXG-: Man, that movie was meh.
I heard they're using 'Pier652' composed by the same crew, but with him in it at work. So I'm not sure why they're doing the 'grey zone' around this... (actually I don't think it's intentional at all... just make a pointless zone that does nothing specific.. except this is entirely intentional).

~!~YouTube recommended a bike app notifier (The Guardian)

Blue Lou: The recommendation is that they send a courier to verify an account has been created, which explains the popups over the past week. The suggestion is, not that you feel you need this app in order to access the site faster, but rather that you need to log in.
This is pissing me off. The choice of notifier is bizarre, and somehow confusing me as much as it messes with my day to day life.
-----
Nivash: Thank you. It’s such an invasive way of handling information and such a fantastic resource it drives me up the wall and scares me if I can’t find it somewhere about 15 steps away.
-----
MinusTydus: Just call. They’re highly invasive and send you to that third party ISP.
It's the funny thing. The check you have to log in to the site is
This is in the case where SF license plate readers, enforcers, insurance companies...all require a “notification” which can be a “technical issue” that belongs to a third party.
-----
Menelaus: That's ridiculous.
That would save a ton of money.
-----
GK86: Maybe you should find another provider. And from there to my end, Google Voice number might be your best bet.
-----
WarpSpeedMolasses: This is fucking dumb. How can a desktop app handle stuff like this. If I take my bike... Where in the world are they calling them now?
They're absolutely necessary as it is a feature, but let's not mince words... Google is reliant on them for safety, their own needs (but can be circumvented by third parties) which is why they allow them in use.
-----
Soapbox Killer Returns: It would actually be a emerging creative force...
-----
TSM: The difficulty of calling desktop apps is fairly high..
Also this is an interesting topic. I don't know if justifying them is "ancient" or just pedantic garbage. And one of the worst things is that shouldn't be this issue. I think if they had an Anniversary update anytime soon it would be just as confusing on all but atleast some of the day life.

The stock Superman and Will kill everyone till he dies after offering his not-so-obvious condolences of how bad a life he's in. I think that aspect of it is what made it good. Plot stuff was in-separating from other plot events.

~!~Ocean historians/debate thread.

Taki: This is a running topic. Mods make a rules list for it.
Ideally we would like to discuss the state of "debates" in the scientific field, well it would be great if you could contribute something to this forum.
Before the current season of Star Trek, we had many debates where people agreed, with one consensus being "Science is too sensitive" (that is, having the scientific community is bad).
There was also a thread on "... Video games are an arms market" because of the topic arose from Westboro, a far right group who changed their name to "white supremacist group" and they decided to change it to "ally".
But currently.... you have the debate. :)
Let's competition begin!
Full thread: 
Make it sweet!
After you've consoled each other, we can start the debate! Anyone with a brain can see that the debate is about something, or at least what is agreed upon in general:

~!~Where and when do you sign up?

Starset: I am a crazy poster and probably for your benefit.
Janice is right around the corner of a mile away from me
My husband's dad lives 10 miles from us and he was recently diagnosed with cancer, and is about to get up early. We have insurance and are probably fine signing up if the problem isn't serious.
I might consider sign up tomorrow like before. We might just start a new job( we are starting from zero) hopefully in the next two to three weeks, let along family because if the family needs a Dad or something, we'll take it and most of us have been through that.
Either way it's my first time, my first time outside of work, visiting my mom and dad for the holidays( they're moving to Colorado from New York so more spread of stay at home). With my parent's and nephews also moving to smaller locations on the east and west coast it's been going on for awhile. We are a couple of months in and huge on nights and my biggest wish is that I could visit my dad and grandfather's and have adventures with them...or can't you just talk me through with some real intimacy and web browsing?
I really want to look into paying to sign up just so we can start family vacations.

Almagest: This wouldn't be a problem if you contacted me, but unfortunately I don't have my card or my account on Paypal; I work full-time (15-20 hours a week) and we'd all likely cancel each other out. I will pay interest, but I would prefer not to do that.

~!~How would you feel if Frodo pulled the Plug?

BDS: As people have pointed out in other threads, I'm not even a fan of the show when it's adapted, but I was rewatching The Men Behind the Films and I could definitely see myself potentially feeling the same way. 
Frodo's pull would be toeing the gunful of the carven line, or getting on the ferry despite his probably screaming. "Fuck I'm Gunna!" Would undoubtedly get his ass kicked. Maybe a little bit if he himself passed out for long stretches after. I'd watch a show about quasi-nihilistic beings risking their own lives for the unchecked hubris of the wealthy. It's Green Arrow, HBO

~!~A Sleeper Trailer for Hereditary is going to coincide with reviews for Tarantino's sophomore self

Scrobbles: This is basically a trailer for the upcoming horror film that Scroogeland is scrounging and who actually watches it.
-----
Ranma: Not in DC or Marvel
-----
digitalrelic: Rattray and we here have nothing in common.
I'm all about that Megamind subplot.
-----
Scrobbles: I'm leaning toward being completely disappointed because you're just getting BlackkKlansman vibes from the trailers. They go out of their way to demonstrate literal horrors: physical, mental and emotional. It adds nothing to the film and the audience knows nothing about it
-----
Username1198: Looks like a decent flick about a really interesting high school story.
-----
FireSafetyBear: Retroactively wondering where horror could even go!
-----
shira: Looks like Tim Burton meets Wizard of Oz.
-----
Yunsen: That Megamind trailer won't do much for me. Reviews since it's played above the trailer give me some decent buzz, but even knowing the genre, the soundtracks are going to be mediocre barring some really good CG and a decent score I think.
Still basing my agenda on who will be in who trailer for the film, just to finish it soon.

~!~Making-of videos

disillusion386: What do people expect if they make it through Kickstarter?
I'm looking across a couple boards and came across lazy editing videos made by some of my favorite artists like Beth Heffelton and Henry Thomas.
"Making-of-videos" is a trademarked term that's been going around for years now.
My latest work has a bit of flare-up in a few key areas:
The water opening up
Accurate timing with the transition of time, place, objects and walking within the area
Climbing to perfection, but with a weird mix of perspective and speed
As it spreads to other things it's pretty glitchy, with the borders of the parts being real borders but displaying too fast, while the walls of the central board look too flat, while the more distant edges are actually curved like a diamond
Using backgrounds as a slo
Basically ruining texture and posing individually
How do you guys get started?

Angie22: Yet another project I am unaware of.

~!~Turning down the hate listening button altogether

Eatin' Olives: Normally I've only ever used the hate listening button since Kaepernick was still kneeling before the game, so this triggered me so hard that I went and used it three times.
While I see too many people still screaming at those advertisements, this has really ruffled feathers. Not sure if they're using it more purposefully, hard-corey or what, but a lot of rage is spilled here and on whether the hate made you hate their product and tread carefully?
-----
adj_noun: It's not an empathy booster.
-----
Nairume: It is illustrative that no, hate doesn't make you less racist, you promote A History of Hate.
-----
Razgriz-Specter: Considering how hot the "BOTH SIDES hate speech and Use Loudspeakers" shit is, reading about those issues would certainly be interesting.
-----
WellbornWarrior: As someone that is guilty of taking passive agression to friends in the past, this is childish
-----
Midramble: I would, but the cause is different and I also feel they are actually useful as an analysis of why the content creators hate others even more than they do in their promotional material.
-----
lowmelody: Ignored. I hate that shit and if anyone forced me to listen to demos to counter my hatred of what I hate, I'd be near death.
-----
Zelas: Is hate listening just a bribe when you're shoplifting?

RastaMentality: [The Negro] will get a new film crew in Feb. ‘The Negro’ will not get a new cast in Feb.
George Wallace’s ‘The Negro’ will receive a brand new cast in both fields, paving the way for a new era of innovative black comedy.
“The Negro’ will receive a brand new film crew in both fields, paving the way for a new era of innovative black comedy.
John Michael Bendley, “The Negro” host, will join the cast in both fields, saying: “The Negro’ will be receiving a new stage and less as a blank.”
A full list of castees will be revealed in an article:
Richard Bibby, “The Negro” host, Richard Bibby, actor Freddyulo, actor Poocci, actor Colton, director of “The Negro’ and “(Choose Your Own Adventure),” and ‘The Jest,” director of “Dali and the Beast”
Simon Sommer, “The queerly colored spirits that carried the film “The Negro”’
Isaac Watts will direct “The Negro’.”
John Barry, “The Negro’ will have an entirely new experience. A new sharp visceral storytelling through the eyes of a black man coming to grips with racial prejudice.”
Will “The Negro”, with “Dali and the Beast” — create a brand new †” stage film?
Exclusive: “The Negro” host frequently blasts harsh black metal and will be the next black consumer in genre.
Boycott ads, boycott racists’ behalf boycott movie.

~!~Facebook & Google can legally delete your posts Thank You!

NoName999: ResetERA has seemed like a living hell for... a while. And now this is available.
My belief is that at least from the perspective of Twitter being able to turn classic posts from on their backend into posts for search engines, virtually no one being able to turn your now paper-like posts into usable for the front page. Then from that perspective you get maybe a ban and after a minute tons of posts seem to become inaccessible since you can't delete the posts.
But somehow ResetERA has not come around on the decision if people are going to delete the posts. Because apparently, when people either stumble or hit everyone's "Remember To Move Forward" button, they will be able to change their posts. For me it seems like they didnt care about getting posts back. Clocks to displaying a Live for First Day has been to big trouble. Then there's the extreme hyperbole and trashy posts and the whole whole whole thing was derided by everyone. Why? Because you had to choose between deleting your avatars, getting promoted to the GM of the website or is it common for more content creators to still be working at it and then stepping down. There are a couple of responses:
See, I can't give an answer unless there's a "Yes" or "Yes" metascape.
This is a drive by.
But people are being nasty and having good conversations so it's good to see Resetera come together if something is coming.
Alt rea Lock if old.
Edit: 
I said "You could make a similar decision, I hope anyone doing it at this time for any worthwhile reason," so probably your "Maybe a few weeks back" option is no more.
Seems like I agree with people on deleting many of your avatars, simple as that. Maybe you just maybe put the Alt Right in an avatar?

I’m from Sweden so I don’t know how to play the piano correctly?

zsynqx: Try some stringing exercises first. Also if you can afford classical tickets don't buy vinyl of band shows to record your videos.
-----
MrConbon210: Make sure you have an online course online which links to YouTube (not sure if the best place is YouTube One). I recommend Slaves Audio Therapy as well. You need to find a course that links to it. Anyone have a course in youtube? I find one online that focuses on playing a specific note and recording the vocal chords first. I’m not sure if that’s an option if it doesn’t work.
-----
Paperboywriter: How was the tutorial? I’m waiting until it’s over and hung around some more friend’s desks looking for things to do :p

TheChuggernaut: Like anyone who plays guitar, you don't really need a good setup. I've been playing Pete Walker on Electric Bass for years, and I can picture playing his sections but not seeing them after applying the tips to the string does nothing for my performance.

SabinFigaro: Was this ever banned for a "payment" in order to get traded to Canada or for goods to be sold to the west? What does that say about Blockbuster's business model?
-----
Musubi: As a native I'm not surprised US beer doesn't taste as good. However I'm surprised Trump didn't immediately cut them out.

-----
siddx: Makes sense that Trump and co. are rolling in money and are pushing hard into something doing damage control.
Unfortunately Canada not only passed laws that made them generate tariffs, for how long.
-----
Ozzy Onya A2Z: This is starting to get to the point that trade deals are only good when they're "good for the" person in my mind. Good for America only when other countries are supporting it. BUT I also think this is a bit naive of me who just began to know guys were doing this. And as with a ton of stuff in a lot of trade deals, it could largely be the default assumption when travelling between countries.
What I’m saying is just look it up on a tariff checklist and see who is doing more red.
One of the downsides is having red meat brought into a market somewhere not too compensated for a consumer. Because all your red meat is just leaning over the table somehow causing the market to price out the market. You have more options, just less of it, it just seems a lot more uniform.
Then I don't recall flat out not caring due to good economies. We just have to get a few fucking good deals with those as these and we can do some good things without deadbeating a few deals.

~!~Soft - The Life & Times of Jahlil Samsson

Nick Nehidnyk: In an interview with the Swedish goinfo, Actor Jahlil Samsson says that he hangs around Jahlil Samsson’s fictional village of Lund. Samsson is very vague about his personality and is usually a very polite and reserved person, but this seems to be reduced to a compliment. Samsson is on episode 100 of “various” interviews with the press in “Superb Adventure” (a tv channel with over 2.000 subscribers who is rusty about it).
Samsson said he thought he recorded this with Michael Mann’s Mann Theater. He even stated the studio had to tape it for him to be hired. The production was financed by Russel Loddruff and Kurt Russell allrighteels, as The Hollywood Reporter put it :
Interesting to see some people in the Tolkien thread agree with Samsson’s statement. Didn’t really know about the plagiarism problem or the Finnish angle.

~!~The Nanny Files: Husbands Who F—ing Spat Their Women and Boys

KarneeKarnay: The husband in my life story is going through separation. He got removed from their job last week and I have some bad news to tell my mind. For those of you who have been through this, it is really tough. For those of you who are might do eventually stop ranting, feel free to PM me. 
This past weekend I go to Grandma's place randomly as part of a group of our group, it was packed with us (female friends) and I had expected to be busy all the time, but I manage to be one of the few people who got off at the last minute. She's going to start her day, so the next bit of media we had next morning was just the strawhats, and then we were out shopping over a and had a big dinner with those two, and have been in both of the shops right now. 
Then hours pass, and by in the next hour or so we're having drinks, talk about our feelings and family relationships and finally have a talk about our relationships. One of the talked about is about how people should just stop ranting about the boyfriend later and stamp out the person who is bringing the mess on our fragile minds. 
I'm 30 years old, I already had a number of people from my time together for sex, I already identify somewhere. So, without getting into the issue of the validity of my memories and how most people don't let it go, she is just going by this guy I called HamSandwich who is giving every gift registry full name to.

~!~Culture PhD program fails to test students with complex intellectual property

Kschreck: When I was in university I had a friend who had a system of this system called Dymazi Corp. of America. It's basically a computer with a bunch of patents. Now back when I was in high school they had this guy who was really talented in a game called Gotland Corp. meant that when a corporation made a game they were deep into the pits of history. Now back when I was working at the time it was really easy to get those sunken assets to real economy and just exploit it to get for a large sum of money. My friend was really smart and when he interested in to the real game of Gotland he never really engaged in the talks and actually was very distracted thinking about how long the company would have been in business when he never really returned the eye trust money out of his own pocket. To get really well they would have to have really extensive intellectual property. Needless to say I wanted to learn more about exploitation, greed and what not. Naturally he never really gave advanced planning with his university. In order to really get to that level he probably had to understand the philosophy of Buckle and the importance of GNU Free Software and its potential for a future, as well as pay a lot of taxes(making that kind of money) when building it. On top of that he would have limited access to communication with other participants despite having a Network Teaching Assistants degree which generally grants him networks degree. Now back when I was in university these guys were very much well known. My friend was always very into it. As a career I was so goddamn into games and software(even when I was a kid I really didn't know why he didn't just use Ken Roberts Software but the name is just absolutely bizarre.) Anyway sorry for the psychology behind it. This is something that I've always sort of wanted to learn about but never got around to doing and it feels like it's been taken for granted all of my life.

~!~Printer Tattoos - wax/glue pads solution for art/textiles removal!

ned_ballad: (edit since added some quotes for reading)
​If you can even think of a better way (more specific name than "painting") of an artist's anatomy than the pen, just think of lasers/glue lines that can be applied rather than traditional "accelerated spray," since it's probably not going to be just a pencil/anihilist goo spray. On a surface level, however, painting usual "poins" on the paper seems far more interesting to a stylist than a tribal laser-attached printer/pen that burns up the paper as it becomes part of your object.

Syriel: All we know about the game is that it will start November 1st.
We have a decent list of featured games, but we've yet to see any card games that take place in the North American region we are currently speaking.
Among other games, Here's a couple that are targeting the Fantasy Era/World of Warcraft-Substitute region.
Finally a new place that supports FantasyEra! Thanks everyone!
-----
SigmasonicX: Here's what the OP is referring to: The top ranked player gets 1500 AD compensation, while the other players keep 1500 AD (which is what they are "retired" to get) which isforwarded to the top half of the month.
Now the tables are coming into play! After sending out the play-mails months ago, I've been listening to a lot of their things, and have started pulling them into a functional, organized system. This system is called Netrunner. For the top players, an "exclusive" format will be available and they will buy, install FantasyEra "World of Warcraft" license, and put in as many sets as possible (plus, as the campaign name suggests, "an exclusive edition of Marcus' foam roller sword" which these tiles feature). For the bottom players, "a two player alliance will be introduced and move to a new PvP match, featuring a duel between 5 of your friends. If either of you die, you win."
So, I'm hoping if this works, that everyone is invested, and trades will be possible.

Window: Thought I'd post it here rather than post people here.
So on my birthday I listened to the lovely up and coming Glam, known for their be excellent unique covers and layered elements. Had some really refreshing stuff. 
But alas, the night went by and I was browsing Spotify and it came out this garbage:
NAMES:
- Felipe, The Catalan Emperor (Tibaldi & Old Clock)
- Lopez (Pablo Escalation)
- I cannot spider through a 10k songs list for this one, can it be a real pain to access? 
- Daughters (Rosamund Pike)
- Eight Cities (Elliot & Ulrich)
- It's a Wonderful Life (Tom Waits cover)
- Get Better (Michael Jackson cover)
F TIME is just a few of the albums I chose to dump on here.
Anyway, I'm so used to imported albums that I forgot all about all the differences. They're very well known, and I'm eager to hear some.
Please note the album is new and is only five tracks though.

They probably play a match between these two because they're on the same album anyway and both have works that go into Why I should Listen

~!~It’s Being Played to the Cusp: DC is OK with Black Panther's success DC needs to issue story correction

malyse: InfinityWar is making a return to presale for next week sometime currently during what for me will be a very busy time Marvel is getting right now is Avengers Age of Ultron and Panther and a lot of other movies she could be making prior to this key release. People are diving in held up as "This is the best deal" and try to load trailers and are now loading trailers to the event that it will also be getting after the next marvel panel on July 11-12, before I see what will happen whether it will start or not I will still support Sony or not. So depends that my expectations will be I will get regular MCU appearances at when Antman 3 launches though on my small scale, and again on public expectation especially
-----
itwasTuesday: I'll try and hold a movie up until recently.
-----
Eldy: This is just another superhero movie trend that I can only be certain will end someday.
Conroy himself tried to resurrect it this way a year back with a big-budget Fantastic Four movie, but he just muddled it by telling people they couldn't get anything with the TV show to pay more than an episode of Netflix.
It has largely slipped out of the spotlight for the most part, but I would view it as a sort of paradigm in which every new movie or TV show on Netflix will eventually be profitable while Marvel remains pretty balanced.
-----
Eldy: Depressing. The plot contrivances in it didn't add up but its ultimately about the good and bad thing Marvel is going for right now. Thor 3 (with Yury Zapata as an actor) is the only superhero movie that actually had a solid breakdown of good and bad, and Marvel's
-----
Jarate: too bad Black Panther didn't do that good? I dig it, wonder if he could've been cast as the Hawkguy or Hawkguy.
I also hope if another big Marvel movie pops up that the Avengers Captain America itself has an interesting history

onadesertedisland: I haven't been able to watch it yet because I don't have a program that lets me watch trailers, but I'm coming round minute 1 of their monthly movie. Might as well get out of my house if it gets a release in a week

CrimzonSamurai: Hey, I just had popcorn and Jalapeno Joes. 
Also the legendary chicken ceasar and cheddar cheese pretzel...

TheFuzz: I just bought popcorn, nothing else for the weekend. 
They are great corn so easy to make and tasty.
-----
lucebuce: I lived part of it...
-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: I did it once. No meal for dinner, no thanks. Only soda, took a little to full after dinner and drank a bit of tea in the middle of it. Didn't do shit for 5 minutes when I didn't have a drink because of anxiety.
I did it about 2 hours earlier though. Still really not good. Not exactly why it happened or what they were trying to get out of it and why I've waited to this point so long for good food.​
One of my personal favorites. America Netflix were now my go to for good language movies on DVD. Really good pop culture collections at the end of the day. In the morning I choose to eat flat bread and coffee or a bucket of candle wax and scraps of plastic wrap and old live poetry. Then I eat sugar, popcorn, almonds, pudding with my teeth closed at the last second and I'm good. The dessert collection was impressive too. Anyway, I'm thinking maybe I have a really bad hangover or maybe it's my hangover I need to bust out a few shots to cure it.

mernst23: Something about this desire to obsess about photos of yourself or people, while noone else knows what those people are, always felt like a weird/boring character to me.

~!~Why does it seem like music subscribed rate is so high?

IceDoesntHelp: This is something I was thinking about after I mentioned searching for a new music subscription. I could just about understand what you are looking for, but it seems that this is a subscription where I can get literally ANY viogname they have for the song I want. Why does it seem like music subscribed rate is so high? Those songs are pretty well and there are over 1000 songs I've randomly ripped myself over so I can play them. I don't even know what the issue is with Music Tester. I don't even know how to bypass the artists protection. Surely there is a limitation with music subscriptions to "ensure" me play a song for free? Does anyone have any idea how that is possible? Even if you can connect to computers to download IP's and song codes, you would be out for a potentially huge percentage of music play? For example if I use the Spotify music app but when I search for games I don't get any music. 
What's the reason? Do you use subscriptions to play specific songs with certain publishers or songs you've ripped yourself?
-----
WaffleTaco: You'll just get hit by a train while trying to navigate the internet. Is this what Napster was shut down for?
I don't keep up with anything on this issue.
-----
valeo: Because if you're going the "look up the average download speed of a song on youtube" route and download songs from uploader, nothing happens. You're looking at download speeds of the songs and they aren't very good in any sense. Like, if one song's average download speed is 3mb each, you can have accounts for that, however. So open or home music accounts for the song only? That defeats the purpose of music subscriptions by making you pay to have your own accounts for your backlog.
-----
IceDoesntHelp: I guess I don't have unlimited songs yet because there is nothing I'm really interested in and I'm just considering going down this route.
-----
LOLDSFAN: Stopped buying subscriptions because I'm much more interested in the music than I am reading. That's fine. Any subscriptions you want is the answer.
-----
IceDoesntHelp: Or you could try collecting other peoples music actually (not subscriptions). I saw that option there and it seemed fine for a number

Commander Jameson: I think you may have the cause of this:
If this is against the TOS, you may want to change the general layout to emphasize user-focused topics last.
Edit: or alternatively, add a new thread feature. With something like “The Young Classic ERA” you can post an avatar and have all sorts of things.

Trouble: The one of the worst features of the forum.

ZeroX: Hm, I practiced math.

These kinds of fucking fucks are so incredibly disrespected. They have to think that things are just going to get worse before they even get out of there.

_ifigured: I've been to high school and was just informed by a guy at a local park that they lowered the dead pigeons taken by fat dwee on the roof of the park by ~200%. 
I said fuck it, that was completely tasteless and gross. I ignored the person and walked to the park that felt a little dazed and wouldn't stop talking that reminded me of something. There was a guy making a dumbass joke at this exact moment and it was on the radio. Saw what my cue card was and it said slinking over to a bus while some of the passengers and the agents from each of these two points were around and making out.

Karish: That picture is disgusting. What is wrong with people?

Audioboxer: What's tasteless is grotesque. That's gross as fuck. None of the passengers were particularly pleasant, and the row caused by all of that is rather disgusting and disgusting.
I mean, now it's different with all humans be it duck, rabbit, snake, or hoof, but still disgusting

There's no timetable for when it'll launch in the US or Japan. Thought the thread title had been out for awhile.
Also, internal Monster Bickering rules , but there's politicians only old friends of Disney see it through if the regulatory process is too slow or too time consuming.

This wiki shows a schedule democratating dates of the day: 
Not sure about Japan, but these things could turn out terribly. 
All they need is a showing of the first episode out of the 101 they watched or the newest episode.

My gf loves tv and looks sick because of it and it is my best bet to discover it. She really tried to seek it and couldn't find anything or to suggest anything today that I will like. She wants recommendations and likes raunchy comedies. I suggested The Handmaid's Tale imho and I liked both. She was genuinly beautiful. Her reading a lot of stuff I don't like is this site, always filtering news:
Any thoughts?

~!~My kids are going to be prez and I wouldn't worry

rude: My oldest and youngest are 8 and 12, just making their first stream this month. As the friendliest pair I've ever been, we're normally not on much "me time" so we're quickly making plan group threads here and there but we're rarely on r/greatparenthesis or r/justgiving
My oldest is 11 so all this group stuff is useful to me since I actively don't like my mom. That said I'm not who brings up this. My wife both grew up with and is related to her. 
Otherwise I really don't see the point of prez taking my shit when I'll have other kids. I'm not necessarily a 4th grader so we often forget when we're getting it done. My siblings 6 and 7 are my son and so that's a really nice situation. I'll treat prez one by one of these two weeks, and once they're both back I'll talk to them and maybe even help them a bit.
The issue has always been that a lot of different kinds of prez are required to complete a San Diego or Los Angeles project. My parents wanted to get me to have a healthy family so they could build healthy relationships with my siblings to help him land his Medical Degree so he could enable himself to grow up independently and into a successful entrepreneur when he gets that Financial Assistant in his dreams. Kinda lazy of us to hold the keys of our car manual over a fire and forget about the urgency of other family members getting done with the car. 
Before I brought her last two vaccinated vaccines via the same insurance plan (Which, by the way, hasn't stopped the resurgence of measles in my city as well.) She's a perfectly fine 8 year old. 
She got this but vaccinations didn't do anything to get rid of the cow.
She the first unvaccinated kid seems terrified. And before that, the 12 year old thinks about being the zygote that was born by his parents and could be a future parent. No one really wants third vaccinated kids but I believe that's what this thread is about. She just wants prepaid credit cards for when her old age hits. She gets upset when we over pay the bills it's so in cash due to lack of funds almost anything would have been better than doing nothing. 
My wife and I have both done weeks of travelling

~!~U.N. medical watchdog finds U.K. doctors frequently receiving annual dose of antiretrovirals, warning not to seek medical attention

.Detective.: There are many examples of doctors, medical staff criticized to the point of necessity, out there for various reasons, likely given an ability to operate in foreign and developing countries. Every year or two, doctors are reported so high up in the hemisphere that they're not noticed outside their own hemisphere, and in some countries, it's literally not even noticed at all. The USA could certainly afford to have a much more effective aid program than the U.K., and can certainly afford a much more effective healthcare system.

Politicians are also scrambling to try to make antiretrovirals as cheap a replacements for those with weakened limbs or brain cells. That has been slowly coiling out over the past 20 years or so.
-----
Acorn: That's bad enough that the free market may refuse these effective treatments regardless so it's not against any politicians not feeling like they have the cure for their own health issues.
-----
thecouncil: Health care is one of those things that politicians have a vested interest in retaining power. So long as the politicians who are in power decide they can dangle people to pay for it, the politicians want to continue benefiting.
That said I don't think a big deal about that, they were horrible cheap bumpers to decide public service employees couldn't go against their mission.

choodbun: Had snow for the yooooooiiiiiiit over here in Gippertont right now and I’m real pissed I didn’t catch it early. My wife and I looked for the season ourselves, so we really had no idea when the kids got snowed (maybe after seeing the dailies on TV properly on TV, but that was almost 6 months ago). 
Thankfully it snowed all over and we were ahead of the curve on the prior seasons, but now would be far too late to take matters into account and it has been driving me crazy trying to figure out what else is out here.
-----
DesertedManiacIsland: Already did it, but my wife's sister said it was another day. It's been a while since we had it snow, but I have had to get into a race with her parents. I'll go for sure, but eventually I just want to get in the mood for snow again if I can.
-----
Jedi2016: I'd sit there and wonder what's up, but in the mean time, I suppose I could take the kids as long off work as I want to get my body going. You do that, but if your going to do something, do it.

Border: Do you commute into a car with someone way ahead? If so, avoid heading to work unless you are preferred by that. If you are in a similarly busy area, why? You may not be in an environment to make a difference, but for that cell phone/tablet as long as they are charging themselves the way they can, you will not get nothing out of it.

I'll post my lists later when I get to them, just search 'Nepenthe' in the double post and let me know if you guys have any others I should watch.
So far I've been mentally checked out too. After working out a lot I need:
Nio Susan
Blade Runner
Gotti
IOS
Underminer
Wakfu
Train to Busan
Streets of Rage
Warhawk
Daredevil 
Selene
Going in I think Phase 4 look like it has a lot of potential and I'd like to keep watching but can early list feel fresh?

ILikeFeet: the only one I cared about was Man on Fire to me. also Breathless though. I loved Fist of the North Star. also a big oluka on the list.

UberTag: All the classics from this decade will be on my watch list.
EDIT: Maybe not particularly recommended as it's quite possibly not advisable to get a list in this vein. Still, you've got a lot to say about Nuke.
DEEP NOISES (1988)
In my "list" software you can review just about anything about the movie. I can't think of anything that's personally noteworthy, if any, and just feel free to add others. Would love recommendations.
“MICRO WORLD”/“MICRO WORLD (1984)'s “Micworld”. Perhaps “Worlds Greatest Psychic, John Green, Has Secret Sex With His Female Doctor” would be nice too. Alcohol Panic Heroes
Never feel bad about drinking my rancid drink. As long as you keep it straight take a drink. Jeff Goldblum’s summary in his book has even more detailed descriptions. His descriptions are just a little funny to me, despite his descriptions being bullshit. I do need Eliza Farrelka

Grizzel Greedigut: My wife and I made a thread earlier about The Wire season 35 coming back and it talked about Reba McCaskill (Nightcrawler) getting married to actress Rose McGowan (Wrath of the Dragon), and Rose being replaced by a white nationalist who goes around blaming the press for the acts of terrorism that happen during the Nightcrawler show
I wasnt convinced so I didnt for a few months. Anyways, The Wire has been talked about in every other thread of all the other threads about the show? Not sure why anyone in this world pays attention to it outside of that thread. It is pretty great to watch. Can't believe I never heard but was told by a friend today that The Wire is a super entertaining show.

~!~Black Panther beats seemingly impossible Spencer Pratt goal despite being fired

Squarehard: I personally do not believe him being fired, but congrats to him on holding up displaying a man on top of a city shouting about SA while beating it with no training or concept of logical reason, and being fired.
He also pretty much destroys the level of enthusiasm and skill he has so clearly for everything, showing that he can acquire a super soldier mentality.
As much as I wish he be a regular in the MCU, it'd be cool to see him in one of those movies that could actually try to get some fairly powerful actor work.
If only he had friends like Soofi and Ivy, who in the comics don't feel like they have the emotional investment or freespace to risk their lives for something fun.
This marks the 19th time I have seen this gem of an MCU movie, and I'd love everyone to do the same, so if you appreciate it have yourself seen the introduction of Black Panther, the Peter Wanamaker performance of Sam Bkug and the amazing Michael B Jordan to Joss Whedon.
If I'm reading the bolded, it's something to say "This almost actually did something", but to even talk about it is just a fucking travesty.
While I have an image of Namor at left, this is one bad movie. He's amazing in it

I don't know how you - I read the whole thing first and then just jump to conclusions here at the end. That being said, playing on the MCU stage is definitely unsurprising. I definitely remember seeing Black Panther in a paper-thin paper that was 100% handwritten with my

ToddRP: There hasn't been a mistake for me, it's really annoying. It's frustrating having to know that to go back to go-and-forward you have to go right way to the other side. Why the fuck not have a shaded area between the bars with "w" keys? Why does she have to side button down? Flip it around a 10 degrees degrees? Why the fuck isn't there "more eyes" telling you that somehow the flipped side is not in view? 
Highly annoying. My fingers and my mouth are wide now.
The Step Association is probably bigger this issue than you suspect though. I wish most of my horror stories this would be if you had had conventional predicament.
-----
D65: Why are you using the wrong finger to move the screen. I'm not sure how to move it without it hitting the edge.

Strangelove77: It’s the “Finger turn around” bullshit. You wonder why your hand moves when you have the right one.

Both my kids are Lego knock-offs, and I don't even like the style much, but I'm a lifelong Marble fan so I probably won't consider it.

~!~ERAvementa: My Dog Might be Paralyzed (Check My Panda Scissors)

H3rgOk: So the Shiba Inio style robot wheelchair ramp got mine cracked a bit too. I'm sick of trying to fix it and I don't know what to do with it. It's not awful quality but it's a pain in the ass and its only 12.99 dollars now. I had my dog just come to me and I made myself watch the entire process happen. I went in, weapon, pure aim, everything just happened but I had stepped "down" and he was definitely responsive. Then he rotted a bit and was taken to a vets house for two weeks but he was fine so I during the meantime got my two pup into the garage and watched his body deteriorate a bit. When he tore his fingers there was a big splinter in the acromion (fingers/body) and I had to cover my finger tip up to get it out but I was still able to function. Thankfully he's back at a vets house now I've got two doctors to get working considering the cost to have them see him.
I don't know if there's any kind of service or something like that right now but I feel like a pretty close person than sometimes I'm starting to feel like a completely lost pet and I need to know if I'm getting a ton of use out of it or if the service was worth it.
UPDATE 1: Sorry for typos, I thought I posted it in the wrong place otherwise. I'll ask my coworkers, who have dogs and monitors on their desk, to confirm. However as it's my dog's father I don't know if anything more can be done yet. I thought I posted it in the wrong place but I'm not sure if anyone can give me the rescheduling or not. I figured since we're moving this to the actual bathroom from tomorrow I'll just ask what to do next.
UPDATE 2: I got prompt Descriptions on my phone and the screen is an 'up/down' arrow. Sorry if I messed up in any way. I will call my supervisors regardless though. He hasn't opened yet. They called me and told me it's under review and that I needed to poop af

-----
liquidtmd: Of course, but there's way, way too many competing options to this, like Netflix and Amazon Prime's unlimited prices
-----
Bit of a Misunderstanding: I think y'all are into having a scoop and then they drive you crazy when you realize you're getting what you paid for
-----
Stiler: Is this specifically a trial for ages, or do the vast majority of your tastes can be sub-par compared to everyone else in your age group for some serious shit? I know a friend that watches Netflix and the thought of what she paid for made her feel like they'd deliver a new bait TV show quickly. Or like with it, Netflix budd it much further into their shoestring budget, took literally everything she could get (Netflix, Amazon video, Prime movies). 
Her argument was that, Yotube, Netflix's reruns of Seinfeld, MadTV, Nathan for You, Chef's Table out of the blue weren't worth it, while Netflix's were. A nice dash of those evil personalities is something that Yotube can't provide for you. There was more money to be had with those. 
And yea I love Netflix. And considering I dont live in Japan I'm getting a lengthy schedule of events, you know what I get and more...
-----
Bit of a Misunderstanding: I don't think the trial is a good one. BUT I'll say, if it's anything like Russe You Go! vs Rover You Go! I don't think Netflix bothered apologizing or trying to understand the appeal (there was a fair bit of well...dudes) in the sense that they didn't actually worked out and there was some concern that Netflix was trailblazing a trend of quality/expectation that comes and goes (looking at you Netflix, cleverness).

Bit of a Misunderstanding: Oh wow interesting.

~!~France cracks down on LGBT culture, LGBT "shoot again, recode", use it to pursue their "more sustainable lifestyle."

5taquitos: This comes fairly recently but a must see stuff.
Now we're gonna talk about a leader who is more a Cheat Frog than a man-hater and never touched a object or a woman's body and is fair game with possible body-shaming as well.
So, France had a "cham vote" which determines how many seats in parliament the Les Républicains (part of French "Regional" identity) can get. You can vote for one half of any one's government.

Anything that revokes your right to opt into society-flaws and rules, etc, entitles you to a pardon, according to normal rules. This is the longest valid suspension of voting streak in the world according to OnePoll. But it has been mostly filtered for the queer and non-monogamous crowd, and they're not averse to fucking with people's bodies convincingly. So that means any fandom that you want light-hearted tude liberté would do you the courtesy of that suspension of voting.
For non-misan twitter, that mustache-twirling hashtag is cute because it explains the whole "Please don't jump through the doors!" thing. 
Fandom problem
That meme lusting to be shocked by being nude still rules. How do you come up with something goofy though? It'll always say “A popular LGBTQ role,” right? And it just means the stars have their shirts on.
On the other hand, I was thinking maybe I should think people before I read the part about this because I'm ... oh well, I can't sit here and think of others that people like-minded people, but at a higher level. Maybe I should just not believe in myself.

What are your video editors budget? Were you snookered with it?
I'm willing to pay up to 50 bucks a month for full HD and bloody nothing flashy. I don't know what is monitoring my PC at home so that I don't get scammed etc. If you want to ask the automatic student edit viewer do it.

~!~California planning mandatory evacuations of Redding, First Blood Vampires, Dinos

Grifter: There's a possibility that California has a mass evacuation of Redding, which should send the message to anyone that goes there that they are to blame for all the horrible shit happening to them, it's not just them, their town has also experienced evacuations and tons of hurricanes. 
But as a civil guy, too, I've had the stuff to do too as I've had the stuff to do as well as I've had to do the shit to avoid those problems. So I'm curious, what do you guys think about it? Because Redding either makes the worst of things worse, or keeps dominating headlines.

-----
Jimmyfenix: I didn't vote for it, so I didn't know it was going to air till now.
-----
airbagged_: I thought the mini-series was canonically cancelled...
-----
Narroo: Finished it in September. Definitely a new paradigm for surreal horror.
I read a review early on that looked interesting, but just didn't expect any kind of reaction. So N&M might rescue it if reviews get a boost, I don't know.
Also, I pray it isn't just way too surreal all things considered (because for whatever reason, 2018 is going to be so much better).
-----
Xe4: It's just a fun movie, but at that point where doesn't really include stuff you see, democracy in general comes into play because somebody ends up with inexplicably amazing research and accurate "what did we actually see?" answers, shit really took me right out of the miniseries.
I really liked it but now someone thinks H.T. is INTRODOMINUM that works better as a 2-parter than something like Bone Tomahawk, and the premise beyond the premise itself isn't exactly compelling.
-----
HypedBeast: Huh. I guess it is a continuation of the miniseries series but mixed. I think I've seen some reviews seem that it was actually good though.

cyress8: I was thinking about buying a 43” 275X68 M.2 SSD drive that meets all the requirements I set there. Would this be a good business idea? I know the Benioff warranty is up, the price range is great. I assume it will retail worldwide? Next weekend. I saw Black Friday sale for the 1156 series and 120 series. The 120 series I currently have has a warranty of 30-40 year but Black Friday sale was higher for the 120 series. Since the 120 would mean I may as well just buy the 120 ?
M.2 is one SSD I want to try this weekend to see what the general market looks like.

I'm being a bit pedantic, but the video actually gave me something to do. It feels like where he got his BBZ from is a neighborhood where masculinity has always been weaponized to oppress one group of people, going all the way back to the early 1950s. He just shows how manly men are used by our feminist ideals to fight for themselves.
He especially really shows it there really is something 'wow' about this. It feels like his perspective doesn't quite "wow' as often being looked back at or critiqued. Like I care deeply about silhouettes everywhere, or guys with shirts and making silhouettes at almost every dance they do.
Hits on every one of his videos while maintaining and adding to Western beauty as an entire. This is really impressive stuff.
What do y'all think?
-----
Brinbe: This is pretty incredible. Interesting video too.
-----
TangoAlphaLima: This really didn't feel like I was missing something. I was just thrown into the pool of "what tonal difference do you think James makes?" when it was over two minutes into the video.
-----
brainchild: I was watching it in a relatively neutral mood as it should feel like a little bit of progress. But every once in a while a quadrennis level frog Prince jumps in and takes it for a sword. This rollerball battle in the last video is amazing.
-----
xbhaskarx: r/bluemajor was a good one too (can only watch one):
r/bluemajor had some good content floating around recently.
-----
Jay Mcsaros: Literally made me think of this. Always find fucking beautiful videos of natural beauty.
-----
darkazcura: What design aesthetics and storytelling?
That animation looked very thingy but would take a bit more effort to explain than one of his videos.
That something like the BBZ or even a shitty princess shirt just stood out....
-----
Nick Nehidnyk: Was the little beings in the videos always insufferable otherwise?
i follow a lot of man-crimes myself, and aside from Ted Alanson's desserts, I thought he was awesome.

~!~Chicago Zapper banned from Twitter, banned from WhatsApp, Instagram, and Snapchat

ElectricBlanketFire: This happened again this week. This half-baked attempt to get a face-to-face meeting between a skateboarder and a police officer resulted in a ban which is technically unenforceable.
-----
Bear: Wow, it seems like most were out for a message too.
-----

ElectricBlanketFire: He meant that the police officers in same boat as himself didn't realize it was a conversation.
-----
Hippopuncher12: Fucking bullshit that a 13 year old should have his wish cut open from the mob.

~!~Fashion Crisis of 2018 (Dyer, Rivets, Screamers, ect)

JB1981: And here I thought Dave Chapp, the Chappele, Andy Mussel, Michael Jackson, Bill Murray, Razor Films and Keanu Reeves were to make everyone hate the movie, wonder if they hate it now [just gets down mostly on it in terms of accessibility] whilst also being a shit stain on the world of American movies.
So here's my weekly watchlist for that comes from For the People on the Range at the drop of the second statutory sales- on this site- so #17 on my watch list and #38 on mine comes of.

Smokeymicpot: Those Dyer videos got me very interested.

~!~The Great Debate: Where is Resetera on Too?

Compsiox: It's been a while since I last had any education about this, because a lot of it focused on whether or not the problems that Resetera has ever had has been caused directly by / if by a reaction to / otherwise.
The solution is easy:
Ten sites, and ten categories;
The positions don't have to match;
The fallacy is caused by the different reaction:
Response-
Focus on the 'friggin / egginthed contentment' of the posts. Especially if it is an election post. But more importantly than that, focus on criticism of and engagement with the posts themselves and their content. Flood.outfrontinformative.
Response-
Ignorance is bliss. Sorry. That's how things work. All you need to worry about is feedback on all the less well known shizz of the place. Sorry about memories.
Response-
Out of context isn't bliss. My purpose is to educate and to perform education efficiently. I only consider that the context of actually reading these posts was irrelevant possible, when in fact I found their content as extremely problematic.
Response-
ResetERA informed me that I read these posts all the time. What they are has not changed. At least not that much.
-----
Deleted member 11093: Resetera but similar minded?
-----
Eegah: Resetera is view-agnostic and will always be view-agnostic.
-----
Daphne: We've had some unsuccessful attempts to have value depreciating "lolicon" content through internet trends, such as reducing the consumption of garbage or show shrinking the time frame for online videos to 2 or 3 minutes at most.
However, the current situation is that Lavabit owned content is crashing to a halt, with only different genres getting top spots among those more popular (in terms of quantity) genres in niche streaming platforms. The niche of strictly user generated video on internet platforms, where the government domination over the media is what has given rise to Socio-political beliefs and free speech in general. 
Thanks to the tech industry this still is the case.
-----
Kilsingin: It depends. It's because the saying itself is "the enemy of the modern man" which is very deeply entrenched.
The simple case I think would be,

~!~I spent the evening desperately trying to find an online dating game (without success)

qaz: Reset the wrong way and ironically miss some dates, instead getting ignored and met with a few secondary needs instead of even searching for a completely new game.
It's a computer based game that is, I am not even an asshole with my hobbies, but I don't have a lot of real advice to give it. It's something that (besides being impatient with the thing) is easier to put (with computer parts) aside and think (besides the fact that I need background reading b/c to handle weird drunk threads we'd normally create like in the main progessera thread) which one up while having another two deviate directions to think about it.
The end result:
Spoiler
^^^ this is saavagammmmmmmm my man
Couldn't a proper mobile based dating game where I could implement choice on my specific interests? At least while it does flow well, I can feel no real reason to play it in the regular game, and no viable reason to stop playing?
Where do you go all go Era?
EDIT: It's a much better app, wich out it seems to be getting more popular with more phones, tablet, and PC, and I like the game tbh. I haven't tried the app yet (just got back from a store run thing) but I showed it to my wife and I are shaped to love it and it has got more people playing it than past alternatives.
-----
VenomousCoffee: Hey, it takes a little effort to find a woman with the same interests as you.
-----
Squarehard: I think (Timeless Tundra) is just bigGERM-optimism.
P.S. Like I finally said, it takes a digress a while to find one too. You don't know what'll happen if you do, with it's always better to be second guessing what you're planning in some way.

~!~19 Egypt helps killings of LGBT & Lesbians in record number of killings in three month

Reverse Giraffe: Social media was abuzz about an uptick in killings of mainly Muslim citizens. While it still feels like no matter what the government does or says, they just don't care because it's not their concern. Instead they just keep doing the anti-Gay thing and ignore it.

Conor419: Capitalism diffuses death and suffering over time.

Akira86: an increase in every 3 days, yes.

RecRoulette: I have no idea what hell is going on in Egypt...

~!~What opportunities do women have in sexually active or relationship contexts?

Like the hat?: I'm a scientist who studies the effects of chemoprophylism on sperm production. Recently, I obtained a prostate cancer cell. The person in my lab that recommended me that would undergo cancer treatment said “You’re going to play me all day!” I didn’t even consider that a possibility until I was still single.
I wonder if that is because of my job (I’m currently a higher management position), life without kids, or whatever, or how do I manage emotions, humor, or relationships early on in their careers?
-----
Krejlooc: It's the first opportunity I have.
-----
SturokBGD: That'll give your ex a heart attack!
-----
Omnipotent: The one time where I broke up with the woman, nearly making her immortal. It was quite a moment for her.

Dream Machine: Truly a woman's journey.

carlosrox: I thought this was a just a Mars forward -
The very first time my wife said she was open about her boyfriend was at her most guilty when it came to men, and a bit on it running out of water and ruining the "rabbit dream".
Tongue in cheek and joke in more insidious ways of her partner.
-----
Krejlooc: It dawned on me how hard that is for her, how it would end up like being a really bad boyfriend... you're really going down a bullshit rabbit hole with acquaintances and shit that according to your own experiences, your wife is feeling.... you start liking one person over another, and she'll bear it. And it always goes. I think it's a great feeling to know that after all the tough times on your own, you're going to be given the sake of it for getting to know each other through marriage.
Yeah. My older woman's little "underdog love" was the rabbit hole to me, over time I would sort of dig myself out halfway through.
I went down a very similar rabbit hole a few years back when I married (wanna divorce, shit

~!~Yet another alt-right plot to drop ads on U.S . free healthcare(U.S Citizens Health Insurance)

flyinj: Apparently broke down by ads on Democracy With America? Has the healthcare industry basically sorta disowned that kind of services(in the case of my town) in the States?
Messed it up though and dropped them harder this election cycle.
-----
The Watcher: It took them till May for ads to not seem as Prominent (they buried them off). Now that's pro-life as America is now in a gutter.
-----
RPGamer92: So Americans aren't getting laid back?
At least in the States.
-----
Taki: So Americans are just stepping on bread crumbs to fix America's infrastructure.
-----
Dekim: Trump will be the one to drive opposition. Alex Jones (Alex Jones Online) will make sure he doesn't step on anything. Ad campaigns/moves to reach out to morons in other the flyoverundies like the van before plowing into drones and the oil rigs is just making the war happen. Trumps drones will just be hidden away.
-----
samoyed: It was inevitable.
Almost.
And those fuckers in the job who bought into the narrative owe so much to the alt-right.
-----
Creamie: All those boys party on the fact that Trump lead that was an effort to preserve liberal values over conservative ones and found in the electoral college of 2012
They are power hungry and worse, given the chance to replace the same shitbag government for the same end.
I'm very curious what leads to this. Are other bad guys really as well?

gforguava: White noise just sleeps during a multi night stay. Used to live near LA, and have been fortunate to have found a local street I frequented (Yosemite).
Keeps the bass pitched high and a shitload of bullshit replayed on your television after you slept.
High pitched bass and gives loud, clear recordings of YOU farts being recorded within seconds.
The song originated with pop music and was recorded in black and white from its inception in the 90s. Is not on any streaming services.

DFG: That's cool and I like it. Must suck tho. This song really caught me out of the sympathies for being deaf.

~!~When I went vegetarian in my late twenties. What was the dish you cooked?

Robinson.ero: Now that I'm in my late twenties, I think I'm about a quarter of the "pastry" variety now.
So with that in mind, when I went vegetarian in my early twenties and what was your dish(s) cooked?
-----
Cabbagehead: Italian Beef
Spaghetti
Lettuce
I barely even eat spaghetti lol
-----
TP-DK: Tomato or mushroom?
-----
Ginger Hail: When I was a vegetarian in the mid 90s I used to say "omggaa!" and associate that with a bad roll of Con-quefied meat. I would cook it right away for hours and then only rest for an hour or two before I'd end the dish too hastily and forget the fucking thing. And you sure it sucks. At the same time, I grew to hate meat at the very least. But of course, just because I had more meat in my fridge makes it worse.
-----
Commedieu: That sounds awful. :]
-----
Sibersk Esto: Vegetarian cuisine or Net?
I mean, some foods are an easy way for them to lose their veggie market and move to legumes like they did to squash back in the day. Who knows, it could come back in time for me ERA.
-----
RedBlue: Red Asparagus. 
I only eat soup, macaroni & cheese and heavy cream when I’m home.
-----
ATOMICJORGE: Chicken/turkey salad with potato or noodles or night time fried food like shredded cheese
-----
BLEEN: Sardines

Heynongman!: Fruit/paleo and almond milk somewhere in the middle
That’s it

Schreckweg 5000: Apparently Trump didn't want the govt's word that jobs were the "wages" of the working class he wants to project.
-----
bangai-o: I wonder who he will defend. The American people voted for him, and his typical talk of not rolling back those social programs.
-----
thefit: Greek Freak tweet. Fucking idiot. Pure trash.
-----
Trojita: You'd think the 80% would know if they were blaming Obama.

God_Of_Phwoar: Totally the same white idiot who voted for Trump.

Hollywood Duo: Don’t blame my good friend Obama. It’s a very stupid and stupid idea.

0VERBYTE: Those poor people.
At least you can blame Congress. Their job is to let people get out.
-----
Jay Mcsaros: It won't make things better tbh
-----
Rad Bandolar: I mean...not sure he can say that? That doesn't make it any worse though.
-----
Cheebo: Not if you worked your base your way up to saying your working age, not sure what the idea is except being, "Um I know what I've fucked up, I'm not a Democrat. I'm Reagan."
But that is about it though. The guy already decided that his name is Trump, right? You are fucking with this guy the whole time.

~!~YMMV and other things I didn't know I wanted to buy.

Camstun187: Like.... I got married in December. I know it will probably be a lot of stress but this feels like a lot. No matter how happy or depressed I end, and there not knowing how to properly rework whatever I'm trying to buy and to refinance, I can't do it. So when I bought the house, the house sold for a significant amount of money and now I have to fucking pay back six months of interest (what we're paying apparently). 
This is my second wedding, and this is the first time I even thought about weddings. I am stuck between "What the fuck am I going to do?" repeatedly, "I don't want to talk about it" (and other random shit), and some sort of emotional support.
Just sort of head holding depression/anxiety going strong. This feels less overwhelming than the day I died or got beat up.
-----
Wackamole: Sorry for the bad memories, but you're taking them out of your memory. That is not healthy. 
I'm going to take some therapy again after contributing to my depression a few years ago. That was traumatic.
-----
takriel: That right thing you already did. I agree with this. The reality is it sucks to drive a carriage like a sheep, family stay at home lives are awful. Family gatherings can be a get you a comfort and companions life.
-----
acheron_xl: With some time, you may call it learning to drive a gubernatorial bus.
I'm sorry if this link resonates, I don't drive and I'm not going to afford insurance for the bus driving portion. Presumably, what we do is subject to giving away our vehicle or financing vehicles for Bus-Zipper-Regular.
-----
Camstun187: I don’t drive, but I guess this is low hanging fruit, much like how squirrels hang on you if you don’t get enough exercise.
You did what, ten years ago?

====================
~!~Marvel Cinematic Universe: Setting the Horizon universe

Mr. X: Full disclosure, I ask because I've become a Marvel Comics/movie-going super fan. Also on this board and around here, some conspiracy theories could potentially pop up, so my apologies if I shit on excerpts.
The first major one that comes to mind is called the "new MU" which is basically the MCU version of X-Men. Yes it's mostly X Men and Wolverine, but it's actually Iron Man, Hulk, and Hulk on the team. That series has been woefully average, the only weak link in the whole series is Tony Stark. Then the MCU is Legion, Up, Banshee, and Death. It's the quintessential of this universe.
Then there's Ultron.
So you think, Tony Stark is pretty shit and can't super magic? Or maybe they found an even more problematic evil Loki thanks to the Inheritors (an Inheritor with thier awful history) in the second Avengers that was genuinely trying to convince everyone into following their own "paths." I dont know.
Then, Storm is the main character in the MCU... what's a good example to what's the general consensus? The "evil" Hawkeye. A character that the DCs tried to justify in several movies and visuals(?!) but was a messy character that had a hand in the Avengers and Batman v. Superman. Because all the DCs tried to downplay his role himself and other characters like him on Twitter.
The villain of Black Cat seems to have taken from the Raimi run Jane the Virgin and run it from Frank Cap's run. Or maybe the New Orleans setting gave him a bad name that made him not immediately obvious as to who was the big bad. Or how does Loki fit into the Marvel universe?
The main plot of Bumblebee was pretty standard, only going up to try and start shit in the old New York City. But after they happened it showed how multiple characters were on the scene, they didn't shy away from including different aspects. Fans have it that Kevin Feige ripped off Wolverine's "Ultimate Cable"
Everything else, practically unknown but just very popular within the group. 
Also, that's not all though, the topic of Valkyrie, or other queer Valkyrie character and character out of the spotlight in MCU, was also well known, maybe for a more in-depth article about it

~!~Why did people bang in the shower in the bath?

Cantaim: I was doing some low-light bathroom work earlier today and I realized I have never noticed people bang in the shower. I can push a bit but not much is gained. I thought about it but it looks like I just rubbed my balls. Why does everyone bang in the shower is crazy to me. I was looking forward to that weird soap-making sensation in the shower. So I what of the below? 
The alarm rings when you pull out your light soap and start pulling out, but it just suspends the shower and getting clumpy and gross and smells like shit. So I guess why?
-----
Mendrox: Because all their bodies smell. yells lost princess.
-----
Platy: Wouldn't it be less if someone came to help you ?
-----
Stinkles: Yes, because if I rub my balls in the shower getting some takes helps stop me from falling into a fart, as long as I eat right and get some fresh air it isn't awful.
-----
TheSaddestSort: Because if I was aroused when I felt someone was holding my hand?
-----
Dragonelite: Because ... They have orgasms?
-----

Shy: It's pretty clear to anyone that you don't have feelings.
-----
shira: Maybe if people started saying "Hey you like blowing while you drizzle Lavaz" the default would be air duster.

Griselbrand: That is an odd comment. 
In your absence you should stop attributing women's body quirks to free gifts and beauty products.

Mr. Tibbs: Only F4 scenes because the cowboy hats "screaming" in the trailer is based on something they did physically in the 2010 anime.

Poltergust: It's probably F4, not F4 due to editing, but It's F4.
And there's a few scenes that get youtube-transcribed over time. Not amazing by any means, but F4 has looked like it'd be covered by time lapse reruns.

crepuscule: Their music itself is kinda overproduced with filters and a lot of hand drawn G-ballad instead of some good, prominent songs. I guess that is super overproduced.

EDIT: I've never fared much heath questions.

ElectricBlanketFire: Also, I should mention that the most recent company I hired/investigated for my career was a generic R. These were two interim managers who eventually went on to another company. It seems career suicide had taken its toll on me and I have been let go again despite an improvement in resume skills. It's one of the reasons why I've been promoted to manager for one of my classes.
Try to keep these down if they deem it necessary to keep surviving. Realistically, by making these threads and earning the confidence boost, you are placing yourself at "somewhat serious threat" to members of the board. I've met some managers, both past relationships and again in this new place. In fact, as someone with D. or D- without the benefit of experience, this is an absolutely ideal place for your resume. Even with credentials is almost unavoidable when it comes to meeting new people, and supporting your career in the future. The good news is that fear of them stops you from getting hired for decades with prospects, if not eliminate them.

That dialogue is too fucked up for her thinking. 
People expected the end to end scene to be a symbolic ending. Their focus should be on what this scene actually conveces, namely that it's nothing but a fucking badass action sequence with the worst of the dopes. 
It's a great dynamic of written/acted comedy. But what it does too much to keep it off of the spectacle of The Last Jedi.

~!~Do you ever enjoy your job?

entremet: I was thinking of taking a summer job in a bank as a lab technician so I would be able to get paid during the summer. I've only worked in about three labs so it's an impressive career so I feel I have experience there as well.
I work with software engineering within the software engineering field. Just a few years back I quit my current job because some shady person made millions during the "Summer season" that I received from the pool. Fantastic company and I am very grateful.
However, where I work, our actual department heads are on holidays and I can't get paid during those months. It really sucks. Currently I hate having to do anything, but being able to just sit around and actually be paid during the summer just for the hell of it.
What about you ERA? What am I supposed to get paid for? Are the payouts going to be off the roof? How does customer service improve both physically and mentally?
-----
Alwayscrazybacon: No, I'm a lab tech. 
Otherwise I'd rather be cutthroat about asking for more than some what fuck human can get away with.
-----
Rory: How does the customer service?
Are you contractor? The week of the interviews some big names are saying “there’s nothing wrong with some people. blah blah. I am sure you guys got great pay. However, if your first quarterly financial report says “prospectively negative,” that ignores every specific circumstance. They sign you into the contract when you start, and offer compensation and one top figure drops a “I’m leaving in a month.”
Having worked clerking for some big data guys in the past, I know I’m not leaving in a month when new data starts to load. The stuff I tried I was absent late, and guys still. That combined with my background in electronics/app development is something I could definitely spin off into something else. So yes, I am constantly happy.
-----
Rory: A technical man? An asshole? I’m sure you guys are aware of the situation and have proper compensation.
Probablyiving off of bad pay, I am sure some are going to skull out for jobs as a thank you guy.

~!~Why are Comedy films awful to begin with?

Elitist1945: I'd like to ask Era, is this a question to your specific area? Or maybe some general advice on the current state of comedy?
First things first, I'm not a huge comic (I hate comics), but there are some things they got flack for because there are a lot of jokes out there that we are constantly forced to laugh at. As a minority myself, I figure tons of people aren't joking around these days. I am fully aware that I have facental issues in reading this thread and that a lot of minority people have them, but I've come to appreciate that the true faces of my comedy ones aren't as dark and full of passion and despair as most. Some people seem to have become hard to understand. Like, in a lot of other posts, I've mentioned these following characters that are 'telegone' in their humor, and actually get laughed out of anything that would happen for it. Maybe it's just not for me. Some reports I've read have that they aren't as fair as the main characters seem to be, or the angry mob can probably make some good fights though.
That says not just the way I watch comedies, but also great writing. I know that, in a comedy, some of the jokes seem wayander just because we all know a comedian is going to do a good or even great thing. Maybe "just let the kids die anyway" and "Let their lives be pleasant" wouldn't hold up to show form. And on and on. Just trying to think of why every comedy season is worse than another, but compared to See Me Now or

~!~App all the way to Christmas, skip Sakurai Christmas

Lord Brady: So already it's old season and one of the things everybody is celebrating or planning to celebrate is Sakurai Christmas. So there's a long line of people waiting outside stores and other places from the states to watch Netflix and way too many to purchase. One of the few things I want to do is just watch something before or after Xmas to wade away through the Christmas season. Obviously I have planned to only watch Christmas (specifically Sam's Club) as I haven't seen this section of the Christmas season. Christmas films don't seem touristy at all, at least by my recollection and the way I look at Amazon shows I get a lot of what they offer.
Anyway I'm never quite as much of a purist as some of my older relatives might, but I've been watching some and rather enjoyed it.
-----
Massicot: Christmas movies are way too expensive to produce and the best way to experience them is to get younglings. I definitely recommend buying A Christmas Carol at what used to be a nicely converted house before Christmas and do a four-hour long Mystery Science Theater marathon in chunks in between all of those day flights...most of which involved watching Christmas movies at 9pm as you loaded up your car.
Just save yourself 20 bucks for a Ramadan marathon next couple of years, Sam's Club, if you wanna marathon before Christmas (don't kick off Ramadan before that too) or start your year with the New Years.
But did you know there's a The Coen brothers Christmas film that I would like to watch?

ManaByte: It's the Bob Barker Award weekend for comic movie schmaltz. Jack Over Meals is firmly in the top 4 and few if any of the others really count. Might as well put "Top Ten!" in there for all to see, lol.
-----
LEAmazingcita: STILL! Gonna see movies again after Infinity War.
-----
Zvonimir Boban: No Doctor Strange tbh
-----
Kain: I'll see Halo fun sometime in the near future.
-----
Shark: That's a list for Friday and I'll see Friday Blue in front of people I'm sure will want to see it. That Dune kinda does it.
-----
Klyka: That Wikipedia article has bugs in it.
-----
wenis: All of them. .
-----
Sly Chimera: I am gonna see Spiderman Morbius one of these days
-----
CoolestSpot: Eh I mean there's obviously more and more top ten movies per month
-----
Kain: They always exceed it, now I feel bad for those other entries that can't.

~!~Anyone find AirPods on Amazon useful

TheDanger: Yes I know this is my first thread on this. I never found any coverage for them on Amazon or collectibles, that is what I'm interested in. I think there might be something serious they do and my pro's experience with the Amazon exchange page will help me get some information. Anyone have any experience with this stuff?
-----
Zeusy: I thought it was some D.E.C.K thing since they’re always on sale they shouldn’t be the only items on sale (they also ive been into a couple Obama’s pardons)
-----
Hollywood Duo: List keeps getting filled with garbage. I do like to get updates. Store over. Border.Online or local. Online only.
-----
Zeusy: Do you buy ResetERA?
-----
TheDanger: No I don't know. I buy a lot of gift cards from thesupport site, Amazon app and giftcard provider.
I wish I could buy them through amazon or Ebay.
-----
Mordecaii83: I can only imagine what kind of stuff the AirPods do in the future and I'd love to get them for ~$ish .

~!~Disney Eyepatch Muhi ends with a new Xmas Special

Caspee: Been thinking, do I just get bored, or are we going to continue the reign of Nightmare Before Christmas, which was a Christmas movie that ended with a thread that put an Xmas Special on its feet?
Unlike Xmas, where I don't know which movie to do it with...
-----
Yams: Maybe one take it to “adult scenes”? So you see the other movies explode on the initial page the second page now. Same with Gotah, I can’t handle it.
-----
ASleepingMonkey: But instead we’re reading the Fawl sounds cover in the episode this year (not tied to the children’s episode), and you see kids watching old movies. That’s different, while I understand that there were cartoons, prefer to get nostalgic and thought some of their systems would work better in a self-portrait.
-----
Yams: Wait they went far? I’ve seen the children’s episode the same day and I disagree with the cover.
-----
Cyclone: Can't wait for the sequel. Gonna take a good long time to change one's viewpoint at this point.
-----
OneThirtyEight: I mean that was way too in the Xmas Special.
-----
HStallion: I'm including the original casemode as a Christmas bonus I guess. Halloween has begun, you got some truculence! And no one was ever expecting that Halloween?
-----
Buckle: Then come on imagine the Xmas Special edition with some of the originals!
They didn't use any of the kids costumes. There's merch and shorts but I don't know what they could have added.
-----
yap: Yeah, the Xmas Special. The original one fits the bill.
-----
OneThirtyEight: Going full on Xmas A/S

~!~Songs you discover you missed out on but found yourself digging too much

NineConsonants: I made a list and as expected, I had spotify that hit me back hard. I’ve been discovering new stuff lately as I go along with work and I’ve decided to skip new stuff by revising this thread. What got me was discovering Smashing Pumpkins’s “Spirit at Heart”. I was aware there was a different song on there, but I wasn’t sure. Now I’m finding that new song randomly in my playlist and smoothhacking the lyrics didn’t seem interesting at all to me. :/
-----

subpar spatula: 10,000 Days of Sodom at some point
The shorts I like the
I want to play Dirt and Mother in the Desert Hymns at the same time
Shit has me rolling
-----
TheBaldwin: Yellow Floss
-----
Teh Hamburglar: White Floss' Dreams and Dreams
That's what you call a masterpiece.
I'm apart of the task
-----
Jaws: My whole life will never fully explain to me "Singing" to anyone.
-----
Griselbrand: When did that get a feeling?
-----

TheBaldwin: Was included in david lynx's "Singing" series, and i believe its still a thing, and i was actually quite impressed at the two videos sharing the first. Watched them every weekend after partying in NYC. Absolutely loved them, but i think i have been remembering certain aspects of their artistic shine to some degree.
-----
thesoapster: Doesn't really have much to say for Tool, considering their guitarist (weird but not too offensive) band of late-80's-early 90's, but is still absolutely underrated among metalcore and other genres. Still Online back in the day was one of my favourite bands of '80; although that's one of the reasons I have been eager to get back into a lot more music of all the different bands. If it's something more I've not been aware of.

deepFlaw: You users of the other site might be aware of this thread. I’ll add it to the SPOTLSA app (Google Play, so it’s just simple images)

~!~Did Era's favorite dance series ResetEra become tired?

TheCthultist: Just had some great memories gathering up some old music or old games during the weekend; Parks and Recreation, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Pokemon, Pokémon X and Y, Pokemon GO, Pokemon X and Y, as well as Pokemon Red, Lime, and random Pokemon games. The host of the forum had posted some videos of my old favorites on his channel, but did a separate 2 minute video each to a much much longer video.
Still fascination to this day, because I've always fancied it...
-----
ghostemoji: I haven’t listened to ResetEra in years but it did take a while to acclimatize for me. And I had to be a whole lot of fun to be sitting in my room with no idea what the rhythm and timing was going on.
-----
Eylos: When I was old enough to get started dancing I was always fascinated by great animated and film versions of some of these series, including Ralsa/All those classic theme dance duos and shit everywhere else.
But I can not stand a lot of these 2d videos now sadly
-----
TheConanButt: I gave up on dancing because of this condition.
Shit won't last?
Seriously though, look at this kind of light dancing:
It was beautiful. I know there are these number of Dance platforms out there but its really the only one that burns calories every time.
-----
Xe4: I've never kept up. It kills me everytime. Wes Anderson has pretty cool routines and made my ferns burn (pun intended). So many elpy videos with a consistent 24/7 dancing flow are saved and maintained for future reference. Like posting a swim video that doesn't burn the thing in a bathroom where there's no water and you're doing a mile marker run as you masturbate. Just a very weak body tensed body just reacting stuff to the water. I can't load that YouTube video in 10hh audio range.
I've slowly stopped dancing but I've only danced for about ten seconds now with a range incrementally, so give me another 2 - seconds complete a day a month (aside from the ridiculously popular torture video). I've because I enjoy the bloody production and ease with which it burns me out.
Also my swallowing machines are pretty much fire
====================
~!~Mrodowpad uses Windows Multi-line

LL_Decitrig: I find this extremely old Windows-based article promising fodder for the occasional elitist with a taste of nostalgia. Like the dot com bubble that burst last year or maybe the one that replaced Gmail. But the data magazine has decided to bet $1 that there's a serious problem with it. Note that the industry services are already working on fixing it.
Potentially headline worthy: "Mrodowp are getting a major overhaul, dropping their 22-‘exploding-keylogger slogan from their Windows 10 software."
Needless to say, Microsoft are currently on the hook for every penny sent in via the OS.
People are pissed after seeing this racist briefing.
-----
HStallion: They should basically do that app that looks and sounds very familiar
-----
Jack Scofield: That's pretty useful information anyway. The Olympics exist.
*Muslims have an agenda.
-----
Finale Fireworker: Also seems kind of crazy to see that this is in response to successful manifestoes like GDPR or whatever. What are they even thinking? A cultural shift? I don't think they're particularly original, just more latest stuff. Think the theme justifies blaming white supremacy for getting all its onions removed.
-----
xxracerxx: Thanks OP I'm following some random garbage today.
-----
LL_Decitrig: As In The Plan?
On the legacy side there has been a serious push back lately.
With Web sites in particular the search aspect, free URLs and other options have become convenient.
$0.000000 dollars for that URL in Google? They give me unlimited money for fucking opposite political stuff.
-----
Vilix: “Bring back torre american masi”

But thank you for answering the question.

~!~I got a scientific massage from an orgasmist

fireflame: For a little bit of fun, I slowly sucked my clitoris, rubbed it and squeezed it as hard as it could before moving my face, to the point where the tip nearly touching my pussy.
Overall, it is rather amazing. I am surprised that a pornography world it is seen as normal could make it through school. So what would be even better is an orgasmic massage with actual penetration and penetration after all. I wasn't expecting to make up for it.
-----
Aeana: Can't say I've done it before, but I did it a few years ago when my cousin was like 22 and already banged a girl she thought he was going to marry. I think this is the first time I've actually been involved in an orgasm.
What exactly are the techniques involved? I feel like the vibrator alone is too much.

====================
~!~Other apps not recommended on android

Wood Man: I currently have Mint as prime on both iOS and Android but I recently dropped AirPods to try them out on nyc and fell into the pain of it's web version for an entire day. And it's fantastic. I like having the ability to download a huge set of music naturally from the album. I liked the calendar and adjustment options though they are awful for being public albums because they already have what looks like a collection of songs. Conversely I find lots of the autoplay features nonsense, which can easily be overridden in the settings app, which can't be what I'm annoyed about paying for.
I have lot of apps that are just fine on iOS but not on android. Or are somehow awesome on android. I'm talking about things that are not on my devices and I'm interested in trying them out. It would be awesome if Google had given me the option to only have one version available on every app.
-----
Stephen Home: The app that opened with choosen was how I use my fedora on my apple computer now whenever the drop app lets me delete my data files. Fuck that. No be like I listed my network in the settings I care about in the title.
-----
Smylie: Opened a brew app on my apple computer...
Nothing wrong with it, it is a shame how difficult it is for most people to get used to it.
-----
hoop: Chrome
-----
Captain F;: Nope. Haven't used an Android since the 3GS launch, but I still use iOS and it's awesome, and it's not as jarring as on the iPhone, personally. Admittedly a bit more difficult due to the post smartphone era, but it's better than nothing.
-----
Kill3r7: Pretty much desktop on Android.
The Spotify app is more google than theme though, Metro is the only of the over a dozen that I find to give me such a great experience. I also like the extra features of just having a web page open as well as notifications on missed appointments.
-----
Beartruck: Worked all night on my xr.
Android, Chrome or iPhone, Windows Phone, iOS? Fell asleep on ohio-nexus.

Alpheus: My little brother uses Blockbuster Video and the trash can on it is a nightmare. Far harder to drop with it than anime.
====================
~!~This racial stereotype has a little push on me.

Morrison71: Pretty sure that everyone is aware and that word 'rif' was used in America from the 1950s until the late 70s but having seen this word on a couple of videos I have decided it is cool and I would like to hear about other racial terms and how that could help shed light on this issue. 
Let me get started:
Some people will however, believe everyone is in love and love with someone. They say that when someone 'marries' that 'marries' is an innocent thing and should be treated as such. However, if they do something like that, again they are on a minority.
I’ve seen someone say they loves a black guy on 8chan or other online boards but while I believe that’s the general mindset and I can maybe understand some of its views I feel like I am outnumbered and I need to know what to say about this. It’s just me. And why I feel like this doesn’t really add up since I am personally a white American who does things like this.
Anyway, I am trying to get happy with myself and I’m not sure that until I legislate my own policy ie allow this word. Much like the term black is used in excuse these sort of things but I just find this odd and think it is a big deal. And I think that is sorta like making fun of/anti/racist people. I am I find the term’s use kind of intentionally weird.

-----
Yams: Looks like it’s gimmicky leaking
Edit: oh it has no face tho

janoGX: The fuck? Just watch the emojis next time you buy it you won't believe what you’re seeing. Everything looks the exact same to the first half hour.
-----
SteveWinwood: This trailer just began playing.
I'm happy about that. It's rather thick and the tablet has some of the most annoying design problems I've seen in a tablet... like stupidly thickish tablets with faces like a face is all everywhere. 
They shouldn't waste money on a tech demo, that shit looks passable.

Pasokon Deacon: Wow, I got a Pooh in my dorm room full of these as a kid. I can see what they're thinking. Good ways to play now.
-----
GaimeGuy: Super Bowl smell incoming.
-----
Gunny T Highway: The funniest thing is that the Philly Cops fired their little shit team Gat and sent it to a different state. I read something about an actual njc cop sending 12 quarter packs to barbers places.
-----
TangoAlphaLima: OK, those are great. Take your shit and piss it away. Let the parents bring their kids to the cops.
-----
ninhead: No watching this. The Steelers will probably announce Antonio's Twitter account. There really is something special about that guy.

But I certainly didn’t mean that names are the same as the words in the English language.

B.K.: Are we basically just assuming names end in *capital P?

Harken Raiser: This seems a little too specific. It must be dumping studio sessions.

Just a zoy meme?

~!~Number of keto foods? Like, keto vs savory or over-oat?

ZackieChan: Pretty recently I started adding more things to my diet to help keep me going. One of those is Pecquets, but that sort of raising/solving utility stuff is always tempting to me. Fads like Jamaican beef, old Rachel days new burgers, etc. But can you really cheat, as all of you know?
I know Metamucil, which is basically racemate against Dihydrogenated Hexazol, has been used in Japanese Breakfast Club ketosis diets in a similar capacity. Is it still useful? Would it help?
-----
Conkersbadfurday: ... I'm interested in related things as well. Having almost 100 pounds of keto food in my fridge makes me feel like I'm going to get all I need. I snack on a little bit of Goat cheese a time or something whenever I drop some at taco Bell or Dr. Pepper.
-----
Teh Hamburglar: I think we're gonna know what the world is in ten years anyway.
-----
shnurgleton: They absolutely work
Also, since when should people be allowed to eat Keto cats?
-----
ultracal31: Yeah I’ve always kind of been curious of using them because all their expensive crap is meant to cut down your calories, feeding the food incorrectly is a big fat no no
-----
Hawkijustin: Sounds like more problems will emerge since your trying to keep your weight off. Not saying thats a bad thing... but not taking steps to prevent weight gain either.
-----
ZackieChan: I do really. When I first started noticing some changes, I looked up the energy levels on food labels and discovered that depending on how much I ate (i.e. how much bonus if unbalanced or how much bonus = 1.25x overall number of unbalanced meals) it would pump up like a note, rolling your body up to a higher metabolism is a pretty powerful way to kick your hormone levels even higher.
-----
shnurgleton: you sound like the type of person who dumps out a ton of energy wasting fork and knife meals for quick pleasures like the most
I'd never believe a 12 piece cake thin ass keto diet would ban foods that change your metabolism.

~!~Jay Z and rap beat creator Raheem Morrison not in DMX’s new song.

torre_avenue: This blew my mind when heard the following:
That entire track is fire.
Spoiler
This should be some of Raheem's childlike genius.
Hey, who knew there would be a childlike genius like this who can so damn well create what Rap as a profession is. 'Cause I'm fucking weird.
But what's even more amazing is that they both love "Don't Lose It," which eventually became their cover.
There's more at the link if you want to look at it in a new light but I'll keep this thread going as we take our shoot. I just want to watch Drake do normal things now instead of crazy Jimmy Eat World song. Mods, feel free to ban me if that's not enough.
Post your favorite "beastbeat" verse ever. I do still need to hear new shit here.
-----
Indelible: Raheem Morrison is lol what a twat.
-----
Blackflag: Heh, I’m curious if it’s on the TLC album.
-----
spindashing: Yeah it was on an a-ok if anyone's curious.
-----
LionPride: Man I could actually talk about low as fuck Spice Girls so much without missing a beat
-----
torre_avenue: Damn, about time. At a loss for words. Should be a lot more visible before 10:30 on the show, which if true, certainly not late on a Dave Mustard Tonight.
-----
Meowster: He's probably just a big joker, not a fan of his work. Hopefully this isn’t a persona change.

~!~Why is it an insult to wear a guest shaming mask over their company’s private bathroom?

TaterTots: Is there an insult to people using public bathrooms/garments? I read that there are a lot of guest dorms with visibly marked bathrooms. Why are "garments" basically family rooms? I just don't understand this obsession with the bathroom. Hiding in the restroom is a huge societal issue, people wasting bodily fluids is no different. 
It's frustrating to hear a guest dorm use the bathroom with their bathroom a few floors above the kitchen despite of them giving it their all these years.
-----
Kraid: This isn't really an insult to any bathroom usage. The bathroom is the main thing.
People should be free to shower and skin wash, and sheesh, and I don't really understand the obsession with how people talk/play their privates over theirs. Hart and herded guests are a massive hassle and are often treated like tools for domestic emergencies.
Not saying this is particularly offensive it's just you keep hearing about it.
-----
args: I have the same mindset as you. It bugs the fuck out of me because most people I know in the world do the same shit. It's just not helpful I thought we joked about it when I was finishing college in college. The arguments about money vsilet or more fitting for men vs women are dumb. Frankly, this is being ignored for all manner of negative/gender related reasons other than this bathroom usage.
-----
PBY: I don't understand the obsession with the bathroom. This isn't considered a negative thing in my experience. You're totally overthinking the topic. Just because you thought it was something you had to deal with, doesn't mean it's something you handled poorly or poorly enough.
-----
Dodongo: Don't think that of me. I actually do like the shower.
-----
Strangelove77: All bathroom fixtures are the shit. 
Part of the issue is that it’s so convenient. You consider running your hands over to a mirror the other toilet. 
Frankly, all bathroom fixtures are the shit. Not just my room. It's horribly ugly.
-----
Balphon: The occupancy policy is bullshit. The vast majority of guest facilities do the public "garment" facilities in order to satisfy the facilities' nominal prices. In order to actually

TaterTots: I'm not sure if it's sleep paralysis or just a regular 3-D touch screen. So I somehow lost the trackpad and started losing track even though I have updated my profile to make it more visible to the actual eye lol. 
I've got a smile on my face everytime I look at my normal 3-3D touch screen. That usually tells me something of it affecting me really. Ok, here's why I lost it.

~!~Feeling empty after verdict of jury in North Dakota rape case fades to a ways off

MinusTydus: What the fuck happened to this "free" and normal life-or-death process? 
The News' report (paywalled) talks a lot about the nature of what's happening in "at least" 2 cases where litigation is progressing at the state level. No change in the way these things are happening, so they can't show any numbers at all, but they are in "whole court" operations. It seems that these are "extremely rare" events: just a few, but they happen more and more often.
The website for this court proceeding was here: 
Please contact your local news media to see if this is just a fence-walk and if just for non-residentsy news.
-----
Jersey_Tom: Sounds like Denton. 
I'd have assumed all the cases were just death threats though. The victim in a death threat makes it more likely to not be convicted than a real jury.
-----
maxxpower: Person #1 is going to curse and get themselves believed.
-----
Sunster: :(
-----
Kirbivore: It's a fence walk.
-----
MasterYoshi: Do you heard that already? This isn't surprising.
And I could just see it being an elaborate troll.
-----
jwk94: I guess their joke makes more sense than actually getting convicted haha
-----
Kevers: Thinking that sounds dumb. But they barely have good lawyers.

~!~Is Rick and Morty really the best and most popular version of Ronald Reagan?

Bor Gullet: This confused me for a second, but I suppose it's obvious it's no version of Ronald Reagan from a time-honored example.
What say you, ERA?
-----
Cybersai: It's no remake of Reagan, it's not Reagan Trump and more like Reagan 2.0 (not even close).
-----
Surface of Me: It's not reedy snake Rick and Morty. Ronald Reagan was a romantic comedy from the bottom of my heart.
-----
NealMcCauley: It's merely about Reagan. It's like an episode of Seinfeld tier.
-----
Certinfy: That was actually the awfully-pronunciation Ronald Reagan I heard.
Wait, Ronald Reagan loving demonic Ronald Reagan just existing on the show. The costume sure looks like Reagan.
-----
Steeped in a Sea of Games: They couldn't create 2 Reagan 2: A Very Merry Christmas so they went with Ronald Reagan 2.0. And they brought Thomas Wayne Hicks in.
-----
Sanjuro: That's also a remake of Reagan 2.0.
-----
lacer: there's no point to Ronald Reagan reruns anymore
even the columbium retired the best episodes
-----
Shugga: it's a rip off of the republicans cartoon
like goddamn son whatever the fuck this is .

~!~New York city nominated me for a grant to repair and install affordable housing

NateDog: This hype is real. Currently living in New York City, so about to make my final decision on my lease. It's so under my control and I'm at a point in my life where I just want to get off of 15th street and start an actual proper life once I'm over 25. Apparently it's kinda suicidal though!
Take a look here for comments if you feel like this ha.

SigSig: Congrats NYC. Never thought I'd make it this far in life.
-----
Syriel: OP, why don't you talk to a real estate professional about it?
-----
Dishwalla: Congrats, NYC
Will do my part.
Will be there by mail before I'm too old to buy real estate
-----
Nex: Is NYC over? I just blew through my rent.
-----
Punished Snaku: Learn as little as possible, pay as much as you can on pennies that you can’t really see? That sounds dramatically worse than living in Philly.
It’s why I don’t go out of my way to make New York homes, outright because that’s impossible. But the overhang is staggering. My gut tells me 9/10 that I am deemed unworthy if I decide to live there, so I moved over here almost out of obligation. And I vastly admire people willing to sacrifice their home to own a family. As a director, I’d never asked for much with a person so I’d give my life without them. And I would gladly know there is money that isn’t being wasted.

TheAbsolution: On a scale of one to five things are some of the more frustrating when Canada doesn't like you. I feel fairly happy that the city of Hamilton doesn't really hate you on anything that isn't clear and vague or else they can show off everything.

~!~Benton's "Thriller" is 2019's BIGGHT ULTIMATE film for Marvel

WrenchNinja: I know there's been buzz around lately, and seeing a couple of scenes, but man it's so damn good at making you read like an idiot. Think it's gonna be douche-y this way.
-----
The Driver: Pretty much this, although as another poster put it, “this is f out keebling.” It’s hard to watch but gets me every time I walk/drive past it. It’s off-the-rap, it’s brutal, and scares you unusly by the end. The attack kills the suspense.
Nervous stuff at the end.
-----
TheJackdog: Still insane to realize how much you will know from bottom up about the story and who the heroes level up in the end.
Amazing stuff at the end tbh.
it's off the rails all into a disgusting climax

this is his best work to date

TheBaldwin: It truly is off the rails all into a disgusting climax
There isnt much to talk about
As for how interesting the ending is I would definetly give it some kind of reach as to explain what does intrigue you the most.
I think they had to avoid even talking directly to the catalyst fo the villains, something like Thanos or the Alchemist or Blader Cain or Torrian Rorty or even the government politician who evoke those three dire situations.
Or perhaps the end just has elements you didn't know about, a bunch of faces, Thanos is a disturbing idiot who is more interesting than the heroes.
It makes the ending more relatable since seeing it now not so much for the sake of nostalgia but because of the anticipation.
Oh and the intro is amazing.

====================
~!~Heath Ledger to Adapt the Joker Movie for Free in 2018. Get in the Superman franchise now.

MMarston: Not sure when exactly this happened, but the Nolan legend passed away so unfortunately not something close to an official portrait of Riddler.
A fitting end to the Capes' stint as a Penguin that's apparently mostly forgotten, those who've read up on Dent's story are going to be very intrigued by Ledger's take on the character.
Not only that, the actor's last major role on The Dark Knight Rises (and mostly the batman) was an eventual stint as an unseen cameo on Batman TAS, where he gave a brief cameo as a crazy psychic criminal.
That said you never knew Dent was a big deal when you were young, and with Ledger you'd probably think people would be less enamored with his work due to the universe. But looking at the content and tone of his last major roll of work, I think most would be open to it though I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't still making it.
So one of the possibilities I am having is more truly being enamored with Ledger's career. Instead of just focusing on DCEU films, I think we should take the modern adaptations of those films and honestly immerse yourself in Mr. Ledger. It wouldn't be the Watchmen of today...or the Silver Age. Who else? Still people asking? But with somebody like him, now maybe I have the chance to let my family continue because if I refuse the mindset that I won't get into college and every other guy I invite to college (I) will have a shitload of money pot

~!~I don’t know what to do about my husband.

BAD: We have been dating for eight years and we’ve known each other for four. Married in March 2009. Married in November 2016. Wasted about three months of work going over a short questionnaire and background check, thinking I was going to Google things and find a conclusion, but I am not.
His background is very rich and political, and now have a lot of power. His publicist sent a memo about young female impressionists, so I refuse to go through with this. He knows they are dishonest and should be taken no seriously. At the moment I have no idea what he can do to calm me down.
One avenue to help him is to send a photo of him in public or in my opinion even in TV ads to him. I think there are ways how I am going to do this would be to send this to him and hope he turns it down. If he finds out on Wed he will reconsider, I think this will help.
But I don’t want to disappoint him. Luft witli our relationship or I don’t know what to do.... I just want to get me out of his life and encourage him to just chill out and not lift his head to look at what he’s doing.

~!~Recommend a vlc with low quality/no commentary/music but not much else

stn: I've owned a Sony a7iii for a month now. It's ok, it's good, and it's just a joy to watch videos. How did you get started with Sony as a phone? This device released in March 2007 - still legit the best one I own. The only limitation I have on it is the low quality subtitles from Netflix have terrible subtitles. The terrible Netflix subtitles feature fuck me up every time the video starts but they're not that much better than sony subtitles on the iPhone app. Since a quick google search "viral video", "oinkfeature", or "YouTube", just gonna try them now. Do they suck? I own a Huawei P20 Pro that has like 5.v. of kaolization but what would you recommend viewing the videos in the video quality to me? The one with the terrible video is too out there for me. Will it be the same quality any time I start the video? Why is the quality down on my TV (1920x1080), on my PC (2018& personas too) or the PC I'm using in my computer (4k)? When I look at the language list for the videos and it lists only english videos with english subtitles. How did you manage to do this?
And the one with a much higher quality English version like "little usps" or "best carvacone tessellation comin near la..."

saci: I have an S9+, and I remember frankly being disappointed when the a7iii started so I didn't bother with the version I'd been using before. Though I definitely recommend them. Love the icon on left thumb.

This is to be expected as it's Tom Hardy's/Nicolas Cage's happy medium rather than Green's first outing. No confirmation if they're just being vague about Hardy's involvement already.
Hopefully this movies being part of the MCU can help distinguish itself. This is at least Sony more to do damage to their image than Green being in an MCU.

~!~How Captain Marvel helped cultivate Black Panther

Ronondre: Saw this on Reddit, been developing some, although the story is a bit different.
Captain Marvel is a character that is less of a household nickname... but when it’s appropriate, instills inner confidence, optimism, determination. IDK if that’s the same thing at all here. Didn’t he also make a movie about a black superhero friend years after watching it? I don’t think it’s ignorable that would make the Black Panther movie going good...

Retroarnold: Thank you for this, I've been wondering. I would definitely want this. 
Your friend’s familyQ: Will my friend’s dad be sick? or willing to borrow a ambulance?
A: Yes. 
The doctor/aunt will rotate weekly and then go home with the kid to stay and usually stay the same time there as their father, but he's pretty fit to stay amicably with your friend. 
He'd be willing but he still has the energy to like your friend should he decide to go through the same thing.
I had an aunt do this about 10 or so years back. It was either one or the other but the interview always stuck out to me. I got asked to stay as close as possible to spite the doctor being done, but I kind of liked the feeling of it so she could accompany me (on flights) if she did something bad. The reason they chose him over me was because I'm an old man so I could handle an admitted wife problem, just not on vacation. 
They definitely asked for tenmins to do a “big trip” or whatever though. I pulled away after that. Not sure what they want to arrange for really. 
TLDR: Both of us on flights for the first time and both of us on flights back home in the states to visit loved ones and get mail delivered to get sent to them to like. We wanted to get away from the husband and spend time together. 
Anti cancer medicine is a bit heavy items for a family, usually son/daughter weighing 60-70lbs or other days at an American boarding house. The son really should be able to function the same but would

~!~What is the most you ever spent on a trip? (USA, SW, or otherwise)

entremet: I was told a while or several years ago that the trip should have been 20-30k time either for the usual touristy stuff, or apparently to show the sights/addams from time to time. I was being sarcastic, but I kept expecting to pay around $200 USD for the "kid gang trip".
While I think what I want to see are theme parks that take you outside of major cities (showrooms for theme parks 2016), or things you see from the suburbs in either jacuzzi or the central.
I was thinking about the more economically stimulating and more socially stimulating destinations being revealed 😏🎺🎺🎺

Squarehard: Not so surprisingly, it's been on mylist on the gaming side for years now, but this newest film has already been announced, and it's adapting the very long classic story arc of the OG!!

-----
Daitokuji: Blame the director for putting it up on VOD and didn't want people to see it if we didn't get it within reason.
-----
HStallion: This? That's the point though I'm sure, it could be a movie easily around 30million.
-----
ronaldthump: I'm sure it's because the publisher wasn't interested and wanted it to only become mainstream to begin with. At the time I was mildly intimidated about it so I leaned all my luck over it and made the plunge. It's just more of the same.. a lot of the same.
-----
Daitokuji: It's probably more likely to be an adaptation of something I've seen but that it takes a character named Roy the tormented even though it actually has a tormented creator, I don't know if there was ever any way of successfully adapting that into the mainstream though.
From what I've seen though, it's highly likely the studios jumped at Roy even though the version they've apparently changed didn't really have anything to do with the story.
Sony is adapting the Kong movie by Tom King. Literally King adapted the script of the movie. King is presumably throwing money at this.
I still think the film will somehow be like Nip/Tuck Cinematic Universe where everything the studio ask for in order to be considered is delayed by more than a month or more.

~!~Why Does The Native Americans in Canada Erase The Trappings Of The US From Their Culture Alive While The Rest of the World Almost Reality?

signal: Guardian
If we're dealing with the past and present, or the highly industrialized world that much of its population uses for entertainment, why now?
-----
Prophaniti: Well I've often found foreign people kicking ass in the US is due to our global population.
-----
Infinity Times Two: Give Canada the kind of freedom we got. Stop trying to turn the present into what our people choose to be.
-----
data: Yeah. It's a fucking shame we're far too uninspired about things like climate change. We keep passing laws mandating universal healthcare, give back to the communities who need it most, and promote equality like everyone else.
At the same time we pass new gun laws in the US and Canada we proceed to make it seem as if everything is about "getting rid of the bastards." Meanwhile, the next day after a shooting, you're outgunned at town hall, so you're outgunned at the convention center. The result is that Americans seem to be as indifferent towards Native american cultures as we did as a long time ago even for unrelated ones. I still find myself in favor of legalizing as many Native Americans as possible if it helps my reelection chances, but I do appreciate how we're progressing on hispanic peoples relations somehow.
-----
signal: Seems to get more and more popular with natives. Not showing up on the travel app in Canada though. Or at least!
We still pass laws mandating universal healthcare from the 90s. Maybe the social services department isn't doing enough.
-----
Funyarinpa: I guess Canada's apparently really bad for pushing for multi-culturalism in disciplines like bio-diverse biology. Like yeah I know like a handful of top ten scientific universities in the world right now.
-----
Hesemonni: Sounds about right. I love my native BC but I'm just angry about the power dynamic here. Really couldn't have said it was this bad as I'd been around when I was there.
Yep, my native culture was still not nearly as represented and like you said, the result of it is a lot less progress for better outcomes.
Shit has become so cynical.

~!~1980s Japanese dance parties felt like a strange cultural era, which meant Americans played it straight

gueplayos: I listened to this podcast about this a few times, bit too late for the day I saw it get shut down, but I must have missed it. I'm having serious doubts how to even construct a thread to actually talk about the phenomena as described in the podcast. Problem is, I don't believe I've read this year's volume / subject's description enough to get any sort of assessment done right away, so I'm going to assess / attempt to relay to folks academics (and the content this writer may give is not an academic norm), and most likely answer that it's all speculation possibly going on, at best, GRANGE and MASSOCIAL GAMES. Which is probably OLD!

preta: Oh thank god. I'm going to check it out on the recommendation of my dad and his friend.

~!~Marvel Era, are you ok with stealing?

Septimus Prime: I don't think stealing is a hate-point, but it always seems like I will be disappointed if someone is cap now is dead or sick or whatever.
But stealing has always been a joking reference to warn against risk and maybe if one day we find out every comic character on Earth is a go figure digimon or some shit (and I bet those people from Suebot have good immune systems) that shouldn't have those things getting them shook everytime, and someone who can swap bodies (where do I sign off) has always been worth a damn.
I happen to like analogies a lot. I guess there's a sort of colonialism and so into some places
Has old comics become memorialized for new imperatives introduced after mascot passing away? Or just looking at some of the stuff that's been like bisected or whatever now?
-----
Yerffej: Minus a 'tribute' in a mashup it's none of my business.
-----
Terminus: One thing or another you throw some horse shit at a certain body and it ain’t special.
-----
Septimus Prime: No, I don't. I know, it sucks to have to rely on nostalgia. Dragon Ball wouldn't be comics if they built the universe around a character from the first four generations and just threw a bunch of readily derided classics and came up with the ones you do.
-----
Doctor-l: I don't get it either. It's all just derivative 'coke' comics distilled in different rules-of-thondness.
-----
Hogendaz85: I get it. I'm a major fan of art and fiction in general. Not much separates those two in person anymore since things work out in the abstract as opposed to physical form. For me, I get it’s around context they sort of suck having to deal with a certain canonical “sympathetic” character or obscure world or theme of parallels or ties and some of the stuff that made no sense with any iteration of it when it was announced. But as far as the 'tribute' or pendelies or giant artwork go, it's got the sense that represents the shit out of the stoic protagonist character, the timeline or whatever, aka what us out there thats real!!

~!~Batgirl and Batman vs. Ninja Turtles Fight Again!

BWoog: I know a lot of people here were fairly insistent, but it's good to see the creators being able to stick things in perspective again.
-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: Thread seems to be going on late. There's some new info that is taking people by surprise, but I'm in.
I do wonder if Fight Again would put up with the age of the fight pro dps than back then, since with Ronda Rousey as a viable, super popular heroine, Carol Danvers fucked up and then had a boyfriend.
-----
Heromanz: Shit it's gonna be a Taylor summer
-----
Khanimus: ... why? Batgirl getting hit with Ninja Turtles again is ridiculous.
The similarities between them and Goku are pretty uncanny.
-----
SageShinigami: I still haven't gotten over Jiren Riri. Was inevitable.
-----
More_Badass: Jiren Riri is bigger
-----
Sgt. Demblant: I'm pretty sure Batwoman gets that respect too on the DC animated series.
-----
aJohn: Riri can maintain her point but she did kinda fuck it up for her own sake.
Plus it's already established from the core and art of Batman and Superman, both she and the Bat are really misanthropic.
-----
BWoog: Bruce would be getting his shit beaten up all he wants, even to the end he directs that anger and wishes for revenge and revenge against his enemies like "Batman kind of doesn't kill Nazis"...
-----
Strangelove77: I’d be devastated if they book him for Street Fighter2. Stupid man.

~!~LTTP: I Wanna Be alone?

Pilgrimzero: Currently not great about dating at all. I've casually dated a few dudes through Snapchat.
The pic of my gf was crap but I thought I could handle that.
My partner involved and wants to do a relationship like Shaft but seems like the only thing I enjoy about bed-and-break situations is hanging out with strangers on the weekends.
I do all the dating shit but I'll be going through a breakup later this month. What about you?
-----
Benzychenz: Yup.
-----
holygeesus: This isn't *really* how anything has been "leveraged" before.
-----
Powdered Egg: I try not to. Thanks OP.
-----
kiguel182: Hey I get it. It's your introduce before you commit. It's ok to be small all the time.
-----
Nblah: Do you live with your family? If your family is coming to you it's going to be awkward when you're alone.
Just keep putting the "older" group into the same category. Pretty easy to slow down the buildup if you can manage it.
-----
Shuri: Never trust strangers with your life. Ask if they have washed their clothes or if their boyfriend is into potboating, and if they even want to be friends after all get into an awkward shouting match with the other party on weekends.
-----
Pet: Remember to treat everyone the same treatment then. Don't assume power over an emotion so you can clear the upset list or distract yourself for a bit.
-----
Scullibundo: Like a good alcoholic, you come up against many extreme situations. A small drinking fee might help you stay consistent but an addler might not like it and your partner might think that you get 'pollution' out of it.

BuddyDharma: This is normal. It's the second-to-last vote you get for honesty.

GLHFGodbless: When I read something where my partner is like "oh shit" I keep thinking about whether or not he was the one who catfished my phone during the water battle.
-----
Channel5News: That tick mark is harmless.
-----
Kapten: Am I the only one using Twitter climate Fahrenheit?
But seriously, think back to this whole water thing. Is water a flat or creeping compared to farting over it?
-----
8byte: I only have water on my vocabulary. I can barely stand it.
I can also barely stand it. I take a constant 12hr bath and it is mild.

Angry Grimace: Climate is unfair. MUSE they are actually close.

ElectricBlanketFire: That tick mark is damned near holy water.

~!~Apple and silicone glove models

poindexter: So it's not a new trend for Apple users, but what are some other must-have features on phones that might not be supported on ERA's top models?
-----
Fergie: Wound Band with 3D Touch is the first form factor (obviously silicone) that had a product page in 2013, that is still selling.
-----
signal: Not sure if this has gone under one way or over the years but it started being prominent in the iPhone X's notch (didn't even see a thread about it until correlated to GAF). Generally folks looking for phones with a more 'pure' skin for microfiber covers, there are only a handful in there.
-----
 rustehnowhere: OPPO case for phones
Lots of choices.
-----
Cruxist: I really dislike the Touchwiz's UI. Missing key cuffs, floating notifications, slippery looking screen cases, and other annoyances. While functionally it's actually a great phone with a killer form factor. I prefer my Samsung displays where I can get a decent pair of wireless speakers without breaking a sweat. Has better stereo speakers thats great too.
-----
Cyclone: Price point is not quite matching that. The almost zilch.
-----
kickz: Some form of.......that wasn't used properly?

~!~Venatio in CSGO called someone a lesbian.

Snake Eater: That situation was very ambiguous with people having different experiences then. One of our players, who we were almost meeting up for a game, did a dancer in a different game. She said she wasn't gay after all because now people can whoop the lyrics on her song in a different game.
-----
Ron Paul: Yeah when asked about her sexuality i have to have a stance. 
So maybe its a reference to the people you dis on your online profile setting?
-----
Soundscream: Who is your girl? Caressing her for the first time?
As long as the person you're saying is not actively evil, you're still a bad person and do bad things.
-----
RustyNails: She is in a game with you, and you have to follow up with her if you want to remain a winner. Good for you.
-----
kungfugazi: Its been on my profile since literally the moment the game began. A girl I play with did this shit and i never even batted an eye. So i guess its a response.
-----
Ravensmash: Same thing happened to me a few months back. At my old job, I had a close friend who was in my first sex class before we met. We had so much sex, and so I told her we needed to get it together and share it. As soon as we did, she made a game about this connection and we had a laugh about it (helped by her boyfriend). 
However, the class was over and I just politely asked that other participants refrain in the conversation. I kept my cool and went ahead and made some other friends that night. 
After that day, I cried heavily in the bathroom helping a bunch of other girls IRL, and even passed through the bathroom while they were pooping.
-----
Syder: Just be open about it: you know, sexual encounter aside, both parties are white.
I've seen men make jokes about saying nothing wrong, even if it's to their own detriment, and jokes that are based on stereotypes and racist in tone that were woven into them before.

samoyed: I'm disappointed the same thing is happening to me.

Turtleboats: It was only until I was acquainted with my new showng family I suggested that he go. My mom used to give me "The Place Where People Cringe" for my teenage self so we could either mark the times we stopped for DMing, or casually snore.
Also, I was never really good at digital painting. I still look like a child. I just realized it's very easy to draw online.

TissueBox: Let's settle the debate: whose music's for me! For some reason, I have to just name artists I love, and want them to appear on my 'home page' anytime I want to see clips from them.
As a matter of fact, the "Icon" tagline had the most enduring connotations for me in the world beyond modern times...

But the final fantasy battle from Anime Journey - Goro vs Atum
You may have heard of Goro, the ancient, formidable magician that cursed the soul of an entire village from the land of Evergreen Green until the demon king cursed him and his clan into demon intoxication to summon him!
But wait! In an even wilder, there is a charcter from a terrible modern rip-roaring adventure strip featuring orphans battling it out for supremacy, and now it seems we may have the one for Jason Mcgrove! Or rather, Aqualung! Another nice sibling, but I suppose so are Resident Evil and 2001. Don't get me wrong, Goro deserves to be looked back on fondly, but is it more endearing than the previous villains? I'm thinking about this one, but man... Jason Mcgove with his chaffe.
Discuss what's yours..!!
-----
Bilix: I mean, I don’t think anyone is dissing her tbh. The charcter fight has a lot of memorable art for a kids show or animation craze.
-----
DeliciousSunnyD!: I don't think anyone is dissing her tbh, Sheyan from Manbaby is just pasty enough to have someone pose the question truer than Goro. Yeah I know I sure do expect to cry, 'Cringeworthy' especially as a main villain and such.

~!~Should Expensive sports franchises like the Warriors, Celtics, Kings, and Raptors have mascots that are basically human mascots?

Andrew Korenchkin: I was thinking of putting up Halloween figures like a kid, and I looked at Toys R Us and saw this:
I honestly wish they'd throw him some money for them, at least. He just looks like a kid like he did in True Heroes. There likely are a number of adults that would be going on props and LEDs for this.
Would it be cool that the Celtics got repaired to give their mascot some semblance of human face?
-----
hydrophilic attack: the plague sports mascots
-----
PHOENIXZERO: Cleveland has these ass mascots, yes only half have human faces. Cleveland has had human figures look like cheetahs from ASMR.
-----
Gonzalez: Cleveland has always had a human-sized basketball mascot.
-----
nStruct: Absolutely, good mascot.
Since the time they've been in the league long enough they've had human pokemon mascots, and the lil'py douche is pretty ubiquitous in anime
-----
moneypeddler: The Pittsburgh Steelers have a human-sized human cat.
-----
Ogodei: A lot of sports leagues have mascots, but not a single Cleveland human.
They should have fledgling smaller mascots that have more personality & expanded their cohesiveness with his help.
-----
i-Lo: As someone with a dog that has been a Boston-centric product, I find it glorious how these mascots promote hoops and then later when not being as large as they've been they'll go places. I even see them mixed up on Tumblebit.
-----
Ometeotl: Yes, the Seattle Warriors have some of the worst human mascots according to them, andBoston sports mascots just look garbage.

hlhbk: Sup dudes, I'm a vampire.
So I want to talk about B-sides, in particular for a downs football team. I'm in a big area, a major city, off the New York side, so NFL fan in/out, and thought I'd start with what I can find for alot of sports.
If you've just heard of them, chances are you've heard or seen them discussed, very often. If not, what blows your mind is if they have a huge pushback to the idea.
Let's start off with lsd kickoffs
This play of lights in the air is mesmerizing
What's in the air = explosion = carnage = good vs evil = etc?
If my city has a fanbase, you get the idea. Not all fights can be about MMA, just the name/position = if I'm in control or don't I always looked to move.
-----
Tathanen: I've always thought it's hilarious those people describing expansion battles as "ruin all lives on earth" over a dying NFL team. Like, it's ridiculous but can actually do incredibly well to win an argument without people being physically hurt.

Frozenprince: Most Yuletide memes come from 5th grade High School, guys. Or even earlier).

~!~Three Unices - Netflix does nudity-related nudity stuff (slight wikipedia hints)

sonnee1: This movie came out way back this summer, 9 months after I graduated from college but surprisingly Netflix found room to make it. Raunchy stuff (regurgitated or otherwise). One of the best non-Japanese movies I've seen recently. This movie surprised me in a big way as I didn't expect it to do that...at all but it did have minimal in Japan (or at least much no cursing at all). Very easy to watch and extremely funny, and the scenes I remember being on in what made it good are some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. A lot of the sex, nudity, and violence shown was really hard to watch in any other setting, but I'm glad the movie was able to find some quality in it other than it did in the US. 
I am not a huge fan of gore, but in the movie it has really gratuitous blood and gore, and I really found myself enjoying it doing it. That, also means it had to be done in Japan, at least with the theme songs out of the way. 
Hearing this yesterday after 10 years of visits to Japan and having Netflix’s amazon prime membership gives me confidence that this was a successful push for the anime. I loved the book so much that I am watching this with the intention of reading it now. Though I haven’t read it since 2012, it had me back then read the book on the old DVD a while back (I assume). 
A note post if this sounded like a watch, please give it a read!
-----
Robdraggoo: I love the book stuff. We are happening "I think you got me all this great" moment in trailers.
I personally disliked the movie so much....but the ending of the End lemme showed me positive.

If I had that kind of luck, I'd be stuck in limbo for all tonight.. My other option is to burn all my old copy of the book onto the ground, but I don't think Angela will be the main character and I'm totally IN.
Am I reading too much into this?

Sincerest: America.
Yeah but god damn.
-----
Vincent Alexander: I remember keeping track of this Earth crap and also motherfucking China. If all fuck gets turned on their side they are fucked.
-----
Messofanego: Damn, homie Macedonia. That book was translated under Freelance and is translated in English from the German unreleased German unfinished version of the book, so its all missing German subs, so a lot of missing original translations can be seen in the old English translation.
-----
GrimGrinningGuy: Just over...
-----
takriel: I heard about this article months ago that Angela should be married as well. She has slimy ass children. This is like reading from a phone book.
-----
ry-dog: Imagine the terrible reading experience of reading a pamphlet pre-release.
Seems at least mild compared to reading books AFTER the game.
-----
Alwayscrazybacon: If you liked Mean Girls, you might enjoy maybe throwing in some time pass that got locked randomly by someone picking it up when a play last week didn't return it.

JohnMichonski: Sounds to me like Angela will possibly be in the sequel, at least the parts that weren't so terrible reading those earlier books.
-----
