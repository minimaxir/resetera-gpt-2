~!~SNL’s ‘Crocodile’ Jar Was Played by Jerry Seinfeld Vol. 3

Spinluck: This has always really baffled me. As I was watching him do a sub on Plastic Love, at that one point he was on cocaine, etc, and as I was standing right next to him I said "Look, I ain't molesting don't I."
Then that was it. Didn't prove to be molesting either but I guess it was a worthy topic to start discussion about. 
Has anyone else noticed this? I know I myself have never been molester

~!~Behind the Horror of Vic Mignogna’s 4:12 minutes on Netflix

RatskyWatsky: A TV-MA retrospective piece about Vic Mignogna’s career. To the surprise of no one I'm sure, it’s quite fascinating. He done quite a few things right, of course, the most obvious, is placing some heavy hitters X-mas hat in his hat and counting down the weeks until Christmas. But most of what he says about his time doing Elfman and doing Mario seems to be lip service and lesser donek, and yeah, that kind of pay-goes kinda world he’s entertaining them at such a reminder that earlier on a guy like him was hugely successful, passionate about his stuff and mostly successful at all their levels. Looking back on it, on his deathbed in a way peculiar to his career from what I have seen, it may of cost him a movie.
 It sucks that the first cop that i believe made him more freaked out than the second. Having just started to watch Umbrella Academy and enjoying watching a bunch of folk, particularly in the youth years, and though he’s had no real control over them at all he did put all this stock into the universe that was MacGowan, with him being involved all the time. Seeing that this group of kids were even getting their thanks by following a ghost strike, and watching the cable news fawn over the unbelievable CTV show they played as if country radio “reality” instead of just being real. Very feeling on these kids when watched them crowing about their stats. Even as a kid I had fun ("They want me to kill") and knew that nothing he did was good but that it was important to keep his legacy going. In some ways, using this as proof he did what he's passionate about and has a lot of talent behind him, in others that he seems oblivious or willfully blind, it was either a wonderful use of talent or not at all.

~!~Nerdwriter - Why the White House Deleted Interviews (Spoiler Alert)

ThLunarian: This guy's real name is Noah "very quietly" Shepherd. And the leaks have been overwhelming since the start, to the point I'm afraid to put his real name into a thread. What is Era's take of why the leaks are so out there? Is there a proper way to look at them? Are there more active accounts of this guy that we should care more about? What is the likelihood of anyone with more intelligence leaking more damaging or untop level secret information to the public?
-----
Sho_Nuff82: If it's to the detriment of the agency, then it's a highly irresponsible move that leaves President Trump with a VERY CONJECTIVE to manipulate the investigation.
+ investigate the leaks to get an idea of his motivation. 
+ make sure the public knows and understands what he's actually doing on the campaign trail. Do not interfere - obviously Trump won't get it resolved during the primary but any strategic communications could come out publicly easily and could destroy someone's reputation.

Typhonsentra: You're basically just asking official inquiries. Seems like he's not a high school graduate.
I expect a leak to end up getting leaked to extend context.

~!~So around '98, I installed Win Recovery, but still had a drop in HDCP Position or something to protect Windows?

Thatonedice1: Any others ever had this problem with Win 10? I know it randomly showed any drop involving HDCP which I looked up and they said I may have manually removed it but... I was wondering why was there anything notable happening?
I just updated my device. What were the drivers doing there?
FYI it was a roll-up of Windows 10? I know you don't have this problem by default but I want to make sure or at least keep safe.
Thanks.

~!~My door has been robbed tonight

VCFL: Just got my front door today and was checking it myself to make sure nothing was wrong or while checking on my spleen. When I looked at the locked part of the door and saw nothing I locked it. Then I went inside to look up the locks it was unlocked. In this case, my neighbor knocked on the door to find the door is now unlocked. I call the cops, they give me the keys and start putting our house on a hard drive, door is opened and the locked part is still there. One neighbor calls me telling me another neighbor knocked on my door already knowing what happened today and that my door is finally opened. 
What the fuck is going on in this world? Obviously it's only there a matter of minutes before your freakin is stolen. He has evidence of the lock being the door before and I'm even trying to fucking understand what the hell is going down on. I'm not a believer, don't believe the lies this shitpile is feeding us.

~!~Ivy League shuffling uniforms

Chrome Hyena: A familiarity with all the huge YUGE shoe boxes that are bundled in with the season wouldn't surprise me at all. I am trying to decide if its better to have a standard 3 piece uniform shopping uniform front and center. I'm going to go with 3 piece (from YOLO rules) but this is sorta a three piece system:
The point is the yippee light blue design is kind of chock full of holes from the front and back of the shoe boxes. The reason for these was from Keith Olsz of Full Frontal:
Yeah tons of companies haven't attempted the 3 piece system, but with the current state of shoe boxes the flip shoe system must give those a new shoe design.
Anybody here been in a situation like this? I know that the guys do the reverse shoe system in Saturday Night Live but I didn't know of this.
-----
Emobacca: I had a buddy who was obsessed with the style..

Not hearing the back turn light on the back turn light vest was a huge faux pas, though, and unless that picture of them being able to see your face really makes you want to do that I don't know if I would wish it on my face.

~!~D conservatism

Kimura: I noticed that "d conservatism" started to seem a lot more appropriate last fall. Now, in today's climate, it doesn't have to mean conservatives are doing something right (like doing the same thing as neocons before 2008.) Since these kind of statements are usually preceded by a few words you don't like, people often associate them with negative outcomes for potential opponents. Today's generalizations are just that (lasting ~4h) the OP is mostly about McDowell rather than suggesting he is making the right decisions.
Spelling GOP has also become less acceptable, does not mean we won't point fingers. My only reading of D Davidson was that he is good only applies to majoritarian government, not that it would apply to all U.S. presidents OP.
When was the last time you spoke of "d conservatism"?

I'm just not sure I follow most of these people or appreciate them as anything more than generic street wrestlers that crawl on poles in general. Now I've seen a fairly innocuous movie I've probably seen a few times before, but never got into.
Maybe I'm just getting older and used to seeing more people performing on pole. And less doodle.
Anyway, they're alright and entertaining, I'd give a little shit before I sit down and feel uncomfortable. Would it be disheartening if I watched Fast and Furious in which they were clowning out highwaymen?

~!~You either win the lottery, or your parent's sister didn't take care of your shit

Firemind: So you can dream about owning a house that offers a nice 3/4 of a house as a neat house, with 36,000 acres for each floor plus some more in the middle of it. And one of your parents will be pulling the strings and you lose. This is one of the possibilities you can win.
How do you go about it?
Option A: Also let the parents talk to you
Option B: Buy with them
Option C: Buy with them
What would you do?
Option A : Spread the loss around to yourself
Option B: Acquire more land
What about option C ?
Does your parents know you won’t be staying because they will be separated at home for a few years to keep money off their rent. What about option C ?
Does your parents know that your subleases is ending and your goal for the remainder of your life is to build the house. Would your mom help move a portion of equity, and would either agreed upon deal with the parents, or your only your needs for the time being, be provided to you by your mother?
What are some simple steps the parents can do when deciding right now to either eat the shutdown or take on the full raise.

Rodney McKay: My parents were the literal reason I didn't follow American "tradingcardistry" first. Internationally, selling shares but in US dollars. My mother bought all the land but she would have to take out thousands of liens on it and have to assume the entire value of half of the family. My parents were not allowed to do this.

~!~"It's Thanos, not Thanos it's Thanos!" -Jon O’Mara


ScreamingJoseph: Lol that quote from Thor Ragnar. Remember those jokes Jon.
-----
VorpalNonsense: Thanos has pretty much canon Dad, all the good ones are Thanos as far as pure characterization go. His powers as a hero are secondary but his daily presence as the showrunner and general audience is just more of an exposition dump instead of actually telling a story other than the fact there's a fictional character to ridicule.
I've only read it once and I don't really see what this is exactly, what is his ultimate legacy unless he basically shows up his family missing the whole time again? 
Besides that one bad Thor arc is probably the peak. Not to say he's not great all while Thanos is basically the end all be all.
-----
Chojin: That last line on Facebook. If Thanos is the ComicsEra cup.
-----
Andrew Korenchkin: A significantly more entertaining version of Thanos
-----
Dyno: He's good at telling stories and creating a narrative around it that hopefully this will help the audience flesh that narrative through even if it ultimately doesn't translate well, but it does feel hard to wrap your head around. I don't believe everything he does is canon and it all makes it seem about the protagonist has character flaws that make his execution kind of irrelevant. 
'If you stop telling X what X is, it'll lead to X-22.' 
S-Town is just pointless.
-----
MJBarret: This isn't really true. Thanos has canon, all the good ones are there, as only one villain.
As a hero, I'd have to say Infinity Gauntlet is the best paced Marvel movie. Black Panther, the Thor Ragnarok tie ins are tied into the Black Panther premise of the MCU, Infinity War ties into MK1, and The Avengers tied into Iron Man2, even though it's just unnecessary coincidence according to the MCU rules.
I really dislike Thanos, he's not Marvel Miles Morales.

The House is gonna have a big session today that is gonna end this shutdown. It will most likely be demoted by the next bill, the consumer-led bill (small budget bill that will come tomorrow), and NOT the Dem bill! But who’s gonna be drafting the bill?
Our two top two House Reps have been tasking the GOP leadership this week after criticizing them every week. Speaker Paul Ryan is up in right-wing smoke with seemingly revealing info on the contents of the bill, and with Tax Cuts, but the gist is that the shutdown is undermining the Democrats’ attempts at shutting down debt. No mention of the Wall

~!~Dear Cartoon fans...I want to read your silly thoughts about me

IHaveIce: Hear me out Era. a year ago I was posting a silly pinup show about me. I thought everyone who can't read the manga(or recent cartoons) wanted to read my posts. The people currently residing in my thread are Reset's and their silly "turns" and whatnot. Below is my sad sad sad sad shit that happened in my life.
So back in my hometown of Laval, we (couple) are getting a reunion event with stubborn old Canadian fans who are (allegedly?) happy the our laughs are far less serious. Mind you we're fans who are often meme-ing and flicking the internet of good old times.
So today I figure I will post a weeaboo gifs of myself and one of my friends strolling into town. And not meas online, for now.
What say, ERA? I really want to read your silly run-of-the-mill adventure comics. I bet you ALL have some ideas for stories/pinups/whatever that resonates with children and Era.
And even if it weren't for comics that are run on their own power levels or having powers being almost entirely based off of each other I don't see comics being used that heavily.
P.S. "How about Who's This Worm? Spider-Farming Barbie" =(
If anyone wants an ending good just read Infinity Gauntlet.
P.S. "Miracle for Roxers" if anyone wants things like that's fine.
P.S. "Cursed Pete and Sheeple" if anyone wants Infinity Gauntlet is fine too.
P.S. "Vote For The Best Mutant You Can Get!"

~!~Are there going forward ORs of protest?

Pomerlaw: And if they are, do they need to sit around waiting yet? 
Why isn't any country doing this yet.
They extolling the virtues of public transport but the opposition is scared and anti-immigration, it's just not working 
Are there going forward. And how can there be certain bus drivers? They are overly brutal and amount to nothing because the bus industry is not friendly to migrants in Europe. They get called upon like every 6 months for humane reasons therefore
They stand in front of a mirror to read about the opposition and how ridiculous the arguments are
Why didn't they protest the Dijs but first get help from Lesotho???
Why didnt they fight against Brexit? They say for returns to Netherlands and customs movement in UK with EU possibly happening in 2019. Was it down to your budget, cost of living or something
What are the current government's stance on the issue? Do Cabinet Office expect them to fight for increasing hours or similar amounts of working per day if the opposition decides to stay in their current position, should they switch to the EU.
What exactly will happen whilst trying to bring their party into power and is there going to be any change of government?

When you lay it down as fairly well know, taking a climate impact assessment only serves to make you feel better about people u shit. Leave the states states the right thing to do someone, it actually harms and makes u ever worse to try to do the decent thing. Also, because you aren't much more political than the states that voted against you previously, but you remember and react mentally that's a pretty decent send.

~!~Twin Peaks SPOILERS

PeakPointMatrix: It does get me back to Twin Peaks a few times, but my brain just got one way and HOLY HELL the show shows had this disregard for pacing, story, or plotting hindered me over time. So I found this particular book and that LDR vibe to be great, but then while reading the book I remembered that Laura is the best thing this show has going for some reason. So It was quite surprising seeing a series that has such focused setting in a setting that has it all coming full circle with some seemlessly detailed lore. How do y'all do it, what's the purpose or benefit of the plots
-----
jack_package_200: I cannot believe you got read through it all again. The first episode has the most compelling things going for it, certainly better than the teases
-----
Orayn: I read the book after watching this show. Looking forward to your replies!
-----
HomerSimpson-Man: Don't want to read non-Trentonian material, but I liked the book. One of the few things that the show lets go was the kinda absurdity of watching characters resort to exclusive "filler" Jim Carrey shapeshift. Wish I could of laughed at the sheer level of insane and pettyness by the protagonists, but I'm too dumb to realise it's still genuinely happening. Saw the show when it was airing around the time I got home, wasn't as interested in revisiting it as I am now, and as I should be.
-----
Bitanator: I found the first, pretty much the only game to have its plot stop on a cliffhanger. I liked that. Found the rest trashed though, after the Visually addicting tale of the week, relative quiet.

Orayn: That was a dope article, I'm not sure who read it; but I wonder how much of the superficially linked benefit the show gets out at the end of it.

muteKi: Good read, didn't get the reference that much even! Info for this fact check would be greatly appreciated.
BTW; my wife is enthralled by this series of books. I'm really liking Jim Carrey expanding the lore so much (he's been perusing the audio books over and over for quite some time).

~!~Scientists Finally Crack a Cheese Break in Microwaved Shit

Amory: I can't think of a single scientific person even now to speak of the word "macrowave" besides the dudes mentioned in the title. My only evidence is that the technique is stupidly not enforceable because 80% of cheese is modified, and we only know how to make a few different transitions to get varying results. 
Chemical engineers are damn near dominated in the research/development field. Microwaved cheese is fairly common today but virtually none exist. In the last couple years, I'll get one shot at adventadie and the "new cheese" with which I'll be supporting my diet. It seems rather stupid how I'd make a cheese and cook it on the grill of a friend's grill. It might be cheese, I'm totally getaly on board. We're looking at crazy food tech breakthroughs in the making. 
Does anyone else have the same old cheese mounted to their own grill? I hope it's not from PB&J's, but suspicion is it might be Russia.
-----
Cocolina: Nice
Fake edit: we can swap raw cheese with heat too! I was honestly more impressed with sriracha brown than any macadamia puree.
-----
Z-Beat: I mean you ain't gonna make macadamia puree pasta and fries.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: Another country snuffing out peasant/black market research could't afford to invest in beans so I need to see some macaroni and cheese and make a macaroni on the grill. Holy shit.
-----
Fuzzy: They know from the academic papers they're pulling from and published.  He's phasing out the Peña label next month, though.
-----
Bandage: A scientific answer to a kind of “how do the Blacks qualify?” Google tells me.
"According to previous study, heat protected skin penetrate heated macadamia and faster mac Das more quickly than other powders. Heat throw proof macadamia protected surface."

Ether_Snake: A lot of that flavour is created by the Macadamia sweating process which is the same as the pasta skin sweat in pasta.

~!~Any Australian ERA members have any experiences living in Australia?

Wiped-Off: "Sorry, I don't know where you are from. Where you from?". Spilled here across multiple, and apparently regional, parts of the world.
Dunno where to start. 
I've moved to New York and back, staying in host cities to watch my brother and sister growing up, since I dropped out of community college and is now more liberal but expectantly so.
A few things that came out of the blue:
- We're taking advantage of tax credits giving you a high rate of return because of government stimulus.
- Many times, people will complain about borrowing in instances and elect to borrow from you. You can pick and choose your loan route.
- Australia a lot of "heavy inheritance" such as doing renovation by yourself to a place very rife with crime, history and mixed-use sites whereas other coastal cities, see such as Queens and West Ham. It has made my family extra comfortable and resulted in a good life for us instead of a shitty 1,500 gritty, destitute shithole just to name a few.
I was on holiday for two weeks with my girlfriend earlier in the year, so we did some research and South Australia is an extremely accepting and friendly place for your totally unimpressed but still highly educated view of things. Am not North of West of Australia etc. It is expected of you that your parents reside, not our parents, so don't be surprised if that doesn't pan out.
Anything else I should know?
Do regretful but excited posts of Darrens thoughts? No thanks. 
Hoping this is just some study-collecting thread. :)

FaceHugger: I can believe Marvel Studios are trying to ditch the Ant Man sequel, anyway. They'll probably do it in an Edgardo Doria fashion so what should stay as final fantasy epic stories.
Wasn't America a nation? I can name at least 15 of those with at least 2050 characters produced.

Instead things are getting so uppity right now with all those European nations that voted for Trump. Data that is already available proves that it will be nearly impossible if shit pops off the tv if you want to enact change in your country's democracy.

~!~Exploring the past has left me surprisingly bitter

muteKi: To us that probably won't be popular with us, the past has plenty of valid discussion - racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Television shows, films, games and shows are all about the past - all of these things get either unpurposed or, rather, forgotten as old media. But I do hear something different about videogames. I don't watch other videogames, and I don't read about it very often because I'm part of the "gaming culture" and it seems I have lost the right to even read about videogames.
I understand games about video games, like Sunset May or Chrono Cross, are somehow earnest rubbish but those games - those neon graphics kids love to tear away - are just so fucked up that I find myself agreeing with their creators more and more over the past couple years. Oh hey, there's all these gaming personalities and serial killers I read about on news tvas, oh hey, there's all these horror personalities and action heroes I read about, that might've seemed interesting, but now I just feel like a victim and that alone worries me.
I know that it might've been okay for me to go to college, but I feel like there's something missing here that I don't get when thinking about how the past happened. There's a reason that

You're going to be overwhelmed with homecoming thoughts/feelings on Friday/Saturday? Let's foster this stuff, man.
-----
Carthago Delenda Feck: I'll hang out with my wife and daughter, maybe? No idea if it'll be that good in New York or not. I'm hurting a huge amount this week because I'm gonna go to the gym, my job has been through the roof (office job actually), and apparently being away from people for a whole day has helped a ton. I suppose my most recent fitness goals are for food and entertainment, which I'm totally gonna want.
I just hate going to work, especially if it's in the morning, since it lets me fall asleep faster and on command. I'm actually also pretty depressed because I'm trying to think of excuses how I can make for not being able to go to work and just falling asleep in whatever window I'm in when you're trying to go to work.
Work stuff like hanging out with daycare assistants or bringing books, etc exists. But the biggest thing I'll be missing is hanging out with my daughter? Fucking hanging out with your daughter?
I just want her to enjoy this game and be focused. She's coming to watch this summer's film. I just want a play by played.

ruggiex: OP, do you have work emails or prom emails to forward to her?

Aurongel: I have no work personal emails. I don't have a prom email but since you're outside the country, a reverse work emails would probably work. Then again, I have emails that go out every day that probably do the trick in more cases than just drama.

Action figure reviews are terrible though

board is one of the best action figures ever.
- GOAT
-----
Daitokuji: One Piece - definitely better than the original.
- Still one of the worst anime anime series I have ever watched- Drool
- horse face sidekick  - Nah
- Basura the chubby guy is great
Frozen Destiny - used for hero's sake is my personal favorite
But the post credit thing is far from bad. A lot of the issues with harem movies as good as were with the original series.
- Saw the movie better than the original series, it was still pretty good for a late 90s anime sitcom.
- Saw it in theaters around E3
Red Dead Redemption 3 - I stole it from a friend before its set at a Bog Love University dance thing. As cheesy as it could get it ended up being.
I personally love The Green's Flower, it just doesn't feel like one of the series heroes

Miso: I'd be sad to not know which forum to go for a [BlueSuite] (this actually stems from a personal issue we've had two years prior), but half of us years into the process, or even multiple forum threads that are essentially harmless, would likely see us as "the asking for trouble" crowd for discussions, or worse yet, "want to screw up". The idea itself is just more of a massive, general awareness march, for reasons that are complicated to be understood by most, and none of us would likely contribute a significant amount overall to the community being active in the forum. Same thing with [YellowSubpost]

KSweeley: At least one member of Baltimore City's board of directors has forced the city to release names of Baltimore City Black Friday sales.
How this happened is fascinating, Baltimore City NAACP members spoke out against this practice and became the final ones to do so:
Rob Porter, president of the Baltimore City NAACP, states that Baltimore City NAACP members were told how Baltimore City Black Friday sales would not happen, Baltimore City Staff Attorney stated that Baltimore City could no longer sell copies of Baltimore City's black Friday newspaper and that members have been told the organization can no longer sell copies of Baltimore City's black Friday newspaper:
Just to be clear -- [various people in Baltimore have] paid off their student loans (some are on disability), paid on sales, etc. The a few other comments and stories by the article that referenced this seem to be especially embarrassing given the increased competition, but this is a case of paywalled.

However, the fact that it quoted something I passed along to my kid after I had a stye cracked open is pretty shocking. 
Also, images shouldn't boost the sales of their new product though, and showcase what your blog/personal site has become. That's just a gratuitous way to drive a wedge for high-level users and a reason to reject this.

~!~The Stream as of 2018

Somni: Welcome to the year for the internet, let us share rare moments of internet porn, sex, video games, anime, comic books, gaming shows, you name it!
I am proffering the chopping room floor with my trousers covered, and I tend to watch out the back of the living room. I probably go out to play video games not far from there, but anything more than that is embarrassing as hell.
Despite that, I can rediscover a hunch as tumbling down the slip I was wearing a few months ago. The previous trip tumbled down a flight of stairs and into my underwear.
In the back of my mind, a shortshirt and hoodie. My normal, tight winter dress, so it was

I want to know if anyone here is using it, if not, who would you recommend? I could be lying if I said it doesn't exist to provide anything. 
I have been using VIMS since 2007, and i never felt like protecting my apps use I the way you do!

~!~WaPo: The administration has been using former staffers for years to frame an anti-Pence message.

AlteredBeast: Correction, trump era staffers have been using former staffers to frame an anti-Pence messaging. They are part of a "deeply disturbing" strategy to pit Republican power holders against democracy.
It starts with the current incoming Republican Congress.
The deep right is openly linking the current illegal campaign to himself...
E.g. Mitch McConnell and his GOP colleagues trying to iron out a provision in law preventing the release of classified documents.
In response to Trump's tweet, the very embodiment of the anti-Pence messaging, Jim Connell told The Young Turks that he would not be excused for saying that exact thing:
Why did he say this? "I won't be excused because I had something to hide." Because he had something to hide. His silence regarding the FBI's refusal to turn over these records was transparent: "I have nothing to hide either way."
The tactics are further weaponizing the weak desire to keep quiet about what the administration is doing.
Yet people can correct for this now.
Example:
If Trump fails to secure the loyalty of a significant third party within the next referred Congress - due to an already existing majority over the leadership - her loyalty shall be insulted. That is right....
If Trump fails to secure the loyalty of a sizeable third party within the upcoming prepared Congress - certainly the majority over the leadership of the GOP - her mental stability shall be rewarded by being praised by the masses. Trump shall now loose the ability to deflect criticism to himself and instead submit himself to how his signature acts on them. No feedback shall shield him from fusend macho-fy the GOP leadership. While some truly believe its still serve some purpose. Cancel Trump, proceed to impeachment, receive the highest honor in America. And then...
...how else does all the backtracking of agreeing to something happen...
You know, JFK is under investigation...
Uh oh. 
Thoughts? 
Impeach!
-----
Particle Physicist: It’s a simple trick to not report them onto Trump’s platform. If you recreate the GOP. That will not be excused Trump's silent response as the face that's causing the problem.

~!~Let's rank the Game of Thrones seasons

mreddie: 8th season
We've already done the top 100. There are quite a few bums, like Ned Stark, Jamie Lannister, The Mountain, and maybe The Mountain?
Someone make a ranking using only the last 10 seasons of season 6 and 7 together. It would also apply to seasons 5, 6, and 7 plus the whole 8th season.
Spoiler: Top 5 is spoilers
During the two years I've been watching it, it has not even been 5 years since The Night of the Watch! Part 1 was released in 2010, and then the seasons 1 and 2 came and ranged from not even surprising to first rankings 5-10. Remember, it goes on so long that people get ressed in during it, because what year is it?
But on a side note, do Americans actually enjoy them less than Game of Thrones Euron? 
Season 7 has its problems, but the 4th season is already incredible. It still took six years for the entire season to pop up.
Season 6 or 7 is usually my favorite season. Shit is crazy. LEGEND of a fly, so freaking long, and with dragons! You can't just climb a thousand stairs, haha.
Have fun!

~!~30 years of hauntings, ERA - Who are your favorite hauntings/parks/villages you remember fondly?

Shuri: As a young kid, I went through years of horror watching Kurt Russel Creepers Creepers for a brief cameo later when I come up on Wikipedia. I never saw a memorial dedicated to the Creature. It remained mostly unopened for years. I picture walking down a sidewalk, plopped down with headphones on and ruminating for few blocks, a 90's 70s nake showcasing various horrors detail and seeming to outlive those scary shit and doing its best David Carpenter Devil Rays back later. 
Even as a teenager seeing creepfever as a primary haunter location for years is a rarity for me, mostly due to Chicago and New York suburbs being crazy dead places I never came, and it's really interesting seeing a point of reference somewhere. Skepsi had not even first glance to me, so the nature of it is a probably overlooked treat, but Ladies and Gentlemen were one of those only memorable instances of abnormality that waned in urban culture. Neothergon got to it, in fact. Even before whisking it up to what some people call "the Underground Walker's Mall," Dwayne McDuffie, better known as Blue Paul, is an exception to this ov
-----
Sabercrusader: We liked Blue Paul. I'm just gonna say that the Swampwalk Inn at the end of the park was an incredibly creepy haunt. I just wish I could find some others to share the jungle paths. I didn't want to drive in circles where The Creepshow would teleport when I was being imaginative, which would totally negate those creepy attractions.
-----
MMarston: A haunted Martial Art School in an abandoned church steps. Or any place created by dedicated students with them just repeating whatever they're told. I thought that was also creepy enough before I recently walked around the block. I had it built into my imagination in the span of a day. I also knew there were other nightmares I had before, but casually played haunted crap uni and instantly fell in love.

~!~What's the average Star Wars experience, and why is it so bad?

fireflame: I have seen a fair amount of Star Wars as an adult, and even seen what seems to be a lot of misleading films and tv shows dedicated to making star wars a fun, addictive franchise. Further along I understood that Star Wars could only sell to children, but still, I had always wondered to myself that as a child, I would watch a series cosplaying as myself, and how that could potentiate some entertainment.
However, I noticed that as I grew older, I watched more things like:
- Star Wars: Clone Wars and other spin offs
- Attack of the Bannervillians and other conflicts with more focus on adventure and whatnot.
- Death Star Wars
- live action films
- much more accurate CGI creations
- products which became so dependent on Leyo as a recent example of Disney putting "movies" on the same level as "movies" for fighting Games.
So in response, I noticed that even Disney and other earlier much more realistic popular and far away blockbuster franchises have been coming to, how they used the "apology films" as a sort of cultural reminder of their past and the importance of the movies.
I was invited, my friend told me the most recent one that I saw that was released after the 2006 Revenant came out, and received an email saying that in no way they are saying that any of the movies were "disqualified", good riddance to all uninformed nerds who assumed the Star Wars stigma knew little about Star Wars (at least not enough to judge if it wasn't just a big cultural phenomenon).
What do you guys think, ERA?
Also if you are one of the people who thinks causal knee jerk behavior by arguing this subjectively is acceptable, do you think this is a good age for new works or games?

~!~Dragon Ball Heroes: Z2A being developed in North America

Syriel: Here's the OPs description while online:
Dragon Ball Heroes: Z2A being developed in America
Dragon Ball Heroes: Z2A will be making its US premier in- theatres in Brazil.
US:
First official announcement was made in Japan a few days ago and now Brazil is listed as a confirmed place. Super and not so much Dragon Ball does.
Japan:
(Not sure what country the announcement is for, I'm not sure if something else is announced at the same point)
(Not sure if treatment of the title Dragon Ball would be appropriate or not, I'm not sure how treatment of the title Dragon Ball Heroes and Z. I'd love to see a fan art of the event as well though. This could be something more in-development can include studio Full Metal Alchemist. I would love to see what other products that are covered are.
Great Animation:
BONUS image from the Japanese Publicity thread in hopes of some type of relation back story.
Patches:

jett: Not sure about North America, but it sounds like most shows can be skipped entirely.
If season 2 is based on the original story then I can see it making its way to North America great.

okayfrog: Kawai:

Marion Cobretti: A conundrum has been solved.
Adapt this for the US version as that's only for a handful of episodes.
-----
Vuze: I wonder if Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood's art is using elements from past Dragon Ball stories. That would be great if true, but this just seems more fishy and lame.

Syriel: That's the vibe the show will have given fans before, tanning the background material well.

What do you guys do when you reach a point where you don’t want your Neighbor looking at you or seeing your face and getting dog piled up on your block for no reason?
And this is precisely why this kind of shit doesn’t make a big deal out of moving, but the real nesheat thing is that in my town even some racist business owners trashed someone, another peoples property, other people’s faces are prettied up too, what have I worded it wrong
Anyways it’s fucking annoying now to know someone is still living with you, but I’m just wondering what other stuff they all do? I’ve started to feel more and more scared of these things seemingly out of nowhere.

Serious question, as per the article I wrote him I'm not suggesting you are giving to others, but he's grasping at strawmanning that first. And also, he has $120 million on the stock which tells me the majority of his company operates in government money. 
I'm also a little bit surprised he still isn't owning the shares after the years that it cost him, even though I use to love the cars.

~!~Happy 90th Birthday to Radiohead - Gonna be tonally different every Friday

Vaelic: Happy yes but at just about the same time. The weekend night hit so hard I hate Mondays
-----
Chained Prometheus: Loved Radiohead as a kid, especially the first few albums. Radiohead had such a strong first EP, I think if you're more into Radiohead then follow their continued drive through "Hive Mind" and then "Don't Worry".
The rest of their albums are a little different, I'd say. If anything there's a definite decline in quality as bands go, though not really at the moment, it's an ongoing decline of trust in bands and of course Newsies is even worse than the rest of the stuff they're in.
-----
The Adder: Loved Radiohead between They and AC/DC. It's why I prefer something I prefer.
-----
P-Switch: Man, I wanna say that I've never hated these guys as a person.
I've heard Newsies, Radiohead, Led Zeppelin... And News/The rest to a lesser extent. The band makes me feel sad at times, and Radiohead and Led Zeppelin were downright trash. I don't mean to be brutal, OP, I want to say that you didn't hate News/The rest.
You have Radiohead with the Daniel Radcliffe situation for some stuff, but nah. Too many threads about how hair-nets are an insult to women up here. I need to see the special version of News/The Sun so I can freely say that I'm fine with what they do.
-----
Old Gimlet Eyes: Love Radiohead. I go see quite a lot of their stuff. It's none of my business to make a list of "all their albums but one thing they always put on whenever there's an issue around them", as I'm right up there with Tom Green's list of views on youtube.
Radiohead is one of my favourite albums and I loved their cover at times. Greatest band. Someone might surprise me with their album cover.

~!~My very first YouTube bump takes some time to load.

Yowcham: Big Big bump! Since when would anyone recommend me to watch it?
I have youtube videos and have been a "vlogger" for almost half year during my life. I do work all day everyday (I make about 350k a year or 12 months). So 17 days a week, I basically work 12 hours a day. I am pretty self conscious about how I fire off my sound system, especially since the main ones I have downloaded are blinged, the video quality is bad, I spit my drink out shitting my banged screen, and the videos are bloated like a bunch of music. What do you guys think is a first step for me to be honest? What's it like to be a technical savvy filmmaker? Is it the first step for a much more more fulfilling and career fulfilling life? Did you grow up with a dad? Did you rock your shit above your head? There is something for everyone and it's a steep learning curve. I think with the possible exception of making lots of money I can't stand watching stuff on Youtube. I am mostly watching stuff nowadays because I like it and like the idea of doing it myself even though have heard its ridiculous as well as a lot of studios run race around me asking me to do it after

AMAGON: Yowcham YouTuber (The X)

Caspah: Yeah. Youtube has always been kind of the mecca for my full-time job/friends, but it went downhill from the early-mid 2000's down to the mid-late 90's after a few things (most of which I only ever hated).
I remember that here in Era its unbelievable how the community did half of the latter doc, but the first natural step was people start talking with each other to just listen to each other which wouldn't have happened back then.
I don't know. It's too early to say what will ground for me in the future. I want that total "YouTube cr excuse", but also to learn I should really stop watching youtube entirely.

~!~2 Hours Ago: House floor vote expected for the day before Thursday

super-heated plasma: A few excerpts:
yes! we own a monopoly, the 2 hour limit was never a thing
Yes! voting rights for gun & gun culture was never a thing, but you aren't supposed to until after Thursday. 
thinkprogress.org and guntots.org may also get robbed
yes, I know a certain simple compromise to get through a subcommittee, let's include certain gun manufacturers to allow a return to mass shooters - but apart from that, the video speaks for itself, that no bill was ever talked about. Including the student loan companies in '97! is an accomplishment.
-----
Goose Se7en: To raise and pay for those slippery slopes required to get the govt to take care of guns. Because of course they do. Look at the money they got for making thispolicy.
-----
tsmoreau: I hope perhaps what I'm being told from the left is that cretins who wanna go to the margin and vote for them will do so too.

PhoenixDark: So like...what time dilation would be fun to watch? Also I didn't really like M. Earth's score.

SOPHIE: M. Earth? I never saw Miami and have never heard that film either. Those kind of reference track? Like they like offbeat references that are there to cool-go for a film sometime manner.

Widdle Puppy: Amazing narration and melodies work there. That stupid Good Voodoo comic convention battle soundtrack tho
-----
Thediamondage: There's this movie on things I would like but for some reason I didnt know who it was to watch and i recently had tickets off to move to Chicago which is being added to the pool for 20 lucky moviepass members to move to a location that has the film adaptation. I feel like the director could have had a good run of the WA franchise. What I want to is a Street Fighter film where Capcom and Nintendo team up to kill fighters off to memory. Then the critter would be fighting again. I know McDonalds is actually a good choice but still Sanrio would work great on here. I do recognize Satoru Hiramatsu from Street Fighter series as Street Fighter, but this seems that he is not a streetfighter villain. I guess it would be something though and I'm pretty sure he doesn't feature in that CG remake though, which made me game save moment.

~!~Why do Japanese people have so much disdain for going to Gatwick Airport?

Soapbox Killer Returns: Why do you think this? 
I probably hate going to Gatwick, I fly very often here and I'm 5'10 and 150lb for two American Airlines pilots and four British Soldiers and the entire rest of the guys are tourists I want to disconnect but cold-blooded. It's my study! 
Did Indian/Pakistani or young Eurobags go to Gatwick more often than France? 
This is super common services all over the world and I see it more with lower income folk.
-----
NTGYK: I go to wherever the plane goes to like take a plane or a bus, I don't go to Gatwick. 
Even taking a bus is expensive for a bunch of people and anything fancy is probably too hot to be cheap, you have to pay for airfare.
-----
Krakatoa: Western Visigoths of the world. 
Gatwick Airport is god tier price for airport hopping. Aside from Air France, no European airports I'd ever visit similar to this deserve that.
-----
hwalker84: For the us residents living in Europe, it's probably no big deal for you. You can just slow car transport around in a regular car or you can take a plane or multi-city car to and from wherever.

Not on: American, Delta, Spirit, United (If no western)
By car: I left Kazbek in Iran when I was 18 and flew there for two weeks with 12 rand.
Also six months to Moldavia/Medina in Europe
-----
Wrath Of Exodust: Because people there love air travel. Everything physically isn't there yet, reliability, the generally bad reviews (fire, inability to board in the past for example), good ticket booking sites (e.g. Eurostar, Booking.com), as well as not being offered huge amounts of competition. I wouldn't worry for that long. And in most cases, just travel wherever the hell you want with that much money.
I don't normally worry about the quality of travel though. Convenience, quality of service, etc. in general can be significant.

~!~The essential Batman and Joker recaps, from the top to the bottom.

Old Man Spike: Short story:
What a ride. You all do terrible Joker stories and I can feel it. It gives me a special place to start at, for someone like me that dreamed of this. 
What a ride. What a ride the whole book has been. 
Don't share this with anyone. This ride gets crazier, creepy, and funny the more you read.
-----
MadLaughter: Batman is the best detective, and Joker is probably of higher importance. Still, if you have a loose obsession with Batman and have always wanted to follow the Joker in life, is Joker truly the best of Batman? And in that case, what is the definitive version of his backstory?
-----
Sephzilla: That line in the OP helped put me in the mood for this book
-----
Rembrandt: Joker broached the topic of his mom being missing and Batman took her to a private ceremony at a fancy gala. 
The story goes something like this.
• Joker (assuming he isn't being played any roles) tortures his brother Vladdy Gilgo , who has a crush on Barbara and goes somewhere to hide, hoping she goes to live with him. 
• Bane tortures Maudy ........... or gets revenge on Joker by committing suicide. 
• Bane tortures Vladdy ............. or gets revenge on... 
• Bane pretends to be a time machine that kills Batman. 
• Wayne murders his brother Kit because he’s insecure about it and Bruce is a prick. 
• Death of comic book villains goes torturing hush deal ............ or something
-----
Sephzilla: Interesting piece. The classic Batman is probably the favorite out of the Bat-family lineups though. I'm really into reading more, in turn getting rid of all the dodgy Batman-related bullshit that gets recapped in the past. Though, more diverse Batman has always been a welcome addition to the mix.
-----
Richiek: Old Man Joker is the sort of story that has a personal connection to the series. The Sunni form of Batman is a force for good all around.
Raimi was a delight to read with his take on the character.

~!~Do you see pictures of naked bodies just to show how fantastical it must feel?

Deleted member 1258: Yes, this is a real thread. I just saw something about some nice body swapping pics of women shared to Instagram. I thought it was quite funny and not about how big of a dick they are horny. 
The subject of "Naked men who swap bodies" kicks up quite a bit more than the below examples.
The text seems wrong in an obvious way. The OP asked for the question and meant to do a poll, so I copied and pasted the question text above. 
What do you see as a clear dividing point between "cute males who suck love women to sass off cutes when they meet them naked" and "naked male who only does sexy shit when nude".
-----
Z-Beat: No, I see them every now and then. Super-feminine, regardless of the setting or objectification
-----
Aurongel: Pretty brain power to include women clothed in very masculine ways, from a purely aesthetic point of view...
-----
Cocolina: No, I rate porn on a scale from worst to most terrifying thing I've seen
-----
Aurelius: Almost exclusively from those who are pretty ewww oh man.
-----
adj_noun: Uh, porn definitely has no place being a major part of any relationship.
-----
Kolx: I think NOBODY has a setup that includes women clothed in hot cam nature. So you'd have to Puzzle Bob or something to probably get that right.
-----
Kirblar: Pretty much. But there's some imagery out there.
-----
AnansiThePersona: All this stuff is so gross is how I see stuff like powermeetings where powerwomen can be shaped like dead bodies. I dont know why anyone would judge such a setting. I mean I can already see what people are doing when gaining power and most body swapping pls. Nobody ever talks about all the dick blowing and shit like sobo says in that context.
-----
Cocolina: The explanation is, repeatedly, yes, very male nude dudes.

~!~MJ Pollak arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder; charges dropped.

shaneo632: Given how prolifically racist 2016's "Never Trump" meme seems to be, indictingMJ if old.
Full list of indictments:
Trump tweet 1
"Trump continued to be an enabling influence during the campaign. It was depressing that this is occurring now."
"After a pattern of reckless, not good, conduct by Trump during his second term, indictments for people connected to Trump were announced. I hope this is the start of a larger movement, with the potential for patriotic voices to be heard."
"David Hildebrand, a prominent Nazi expert, has been indicted. Charges will now be dropped."
Really old tweet? The evidence was based on internal Tax returns and Hildebrand was also Hildebrand's boss during the VW dieselgate scandal, the other prominent Trump thing that he knew about and encouraged would have been damning in the slightest way.
As the one quoted above has mentioned, de-ranking tweets can be problematic but they can also serve as safety nets or considerations for others on the investigation. Moreover Trump involved Mueller to the point of actually being able to take hold of someone's opinions/communications quite easily, or at the very least it would have been fairly worthy of inquiry.
Reminder: The sourcesendez is due to who would be the target of an overarching search under "bylines," because if any citizens fall afoul of treaty obligations, Rosenstein could double down on his noble intentions.
-----
Sub Level: lmao those were the twitter handle of dead dog fucks
-----
BWoog: Oh for fuck's sakes.
-----
admiraltaftbar: :( Hope these people get primed out of office. Fucking assholes calling into question democracy aren't funny. Inciting mass chaos and destruction into a desperate attempt to hunt down cunt Trump family as he prepares to face charges is laughable.
-----
Hecht: I'd say at this point Mueller should simply indict back to ass, to protect his investigation at this time and for the best. These people are absolutely fuming right now and his supporters shouldn't be letting it slide like this. We've seen too many at the moment.
-----
ArkhamFantasy: If Trump instains an investigation leading to the firings of local police at election, or just plain vanilla officers without news stories being published

Can't tell if it's cheesy good, cheesy dumb action or even completely stupid us cheesy dumb bad

~!~LTTP: Cloud Atlas is really awesome

MosquitoMan: Quick backstory: I was bored at school and my brother was out of high school. So I decided to look for work and naturally I looked for a potential job in France that would allow me to pursue animation work like I would any other artist. All of my budget was maxed out towards animation and videogames known to man. I delivered from 15 on, but when I was about to complete my project I had a feeling something was off. So I went into looking for a job in animation. Looking up a similar position in america I identified an interesting thing: a GCSE which you can get through Uni (which I did. But it required a three month course which was incalculable). I was even further away from graduating, however, so I decided to take it upon myself to send out a few books that I was interested in.
The first game I created for the class was called "CP 7" and it was pretty cool. The art style was pretty unique in the board game and its board game inspired me to seek higher levels of enlightenment. So, I created some books I had first hand. "CP 7: Hidden Paradox" (just a concept based on static fantasy while the very first game was based on magic.) "Hidden Paradox: Spellbinder of the Realms" (levels of magic.) "C 8" (temporarily a professor fictional scenario). But I'm not finished with this crack but the final books I had first hand,.
Now, all I had between the games is a Kindle Fire, what with the Paperwhite and the Touch. But it very much feels like I duped myself into thinking. All I had to pay for the Google Play Store for my projects is Let's Plays, a popular board game and namesake of course the Hidden Paradox. While I am a small developer at this point in time I know that Google Play continues to have an exceptional catalog of original Plays and when they have cool mechanics I may do a bit of testing of themed loot boxes like Starfinder and actually provide play as well as a service called AI Kids Play which is usually negotiated as a Pay What You Wish option and has to be playable. 
And, while I'm sure there are others who are deviating from one setting or the other, it definitely feels like a wild west that I'm still discovering. If you're a collector or a w

Socivol: Suddenly at random I can hear this noise. I'm reminded I have a Chiefs fan I follow.
I came across this noise when I went to visit for the first time and was unable to find another place to stream it because of the WPMT broadcast. I searched for youtube but couldn't find the signal. Has anyone got a solution to get this noise off the TV completely?

Dishwalla: Wow that sample is loud. Especially when it's in the background on CW, by the way.

EYEL1NER: I saw the live feed and immediately don’t want to watch a crowd of fans watch an NFL team actually go out and do something. Asian NFL, but definitely one that’s on HSN or ESPN.
-----
Socivol: Damn I’m blind so what you expecting?
-----
Matthew77: I remember one of the nicer clubs I was involved in due to our area being so cheap to build a game called the Kid Zone, but way too expensive and it was as mediocre as the team I was in. The kickstarter was well along the way when I first stumbled onto it but the stadium had plaster art of the Chiefs mascot and Turf Boatman on it. It sucked and basically transformed the team.
It was one of the best night rounds of the year for me too. Beautiful stadium.
The regular season games were smaller parts of NFL games but it was so good. The Chiefs played at Lambeau Field with all the major games remaining. 
I know you're down for the pros, but I'm good with it at times. As long as you said you were fully up for it, there is plenty of time to experience these games.

Psychoward: Maybe some obscure electro house song, maybe something that's more euro, maybe something you grew up in the hood. Then you have something really out there that just seems horrible human. How about music that is... bad.
Sometimes bad is better just like bad it always is and makes you sick enough to want it over something you found enjoyable and something you're compelled to seek out only for it to turn out your mind is too far gone to take in.
Edit: I'm not asking for raps or for bad boy tears.

~!~Amazon drops Russell Crowe’s Dracula reference in new play for 2018.

Htown: Kinda hard to believe it. And a real condemnation to anyone not working on one of these figures.
Alot of people actually liked Dracula, so maybe not exactly interested in the rest of his history.
Amazon has stopped doing that reference too too.
Most people on this site hate them for their Dracula MC. It's great and they keep giving it away. They need to start making more Dracula movies(watch Bag of Bones if you're a fan of Dr.Akins). The audiences hate it because they don't like it.
This is off topic, but Amazon's jokes about seemingly using reference songs about Dracula were a cringey joke (like when they brought it up during the guest speakers for their Ash Vs. Evil Dead video) I don't think any actor is doing a good job of making licensed string arrangements.
Dekel, Candy, Sleep for Dr.Akins is pretty clean I think.

Rules:
1 - You need to have either (

The only correct field should be...
3 - The first name must be your first name.
Please make sure whatever field you want is in your address.
If you're going to add another person then just save the matches as you would have messed with this match if you matched!
I’m banking on Rams side cash - and I’ll just play my part.
Just make sure to spell their address 1-8™ which I think may make the difference between a match or a ticket. It doesn’t matter what name they give you - you can mark it in before sending it out. Also means there is no 'mark up' to see which place you are using. The match is invalid unless you opt-in back to the east coast.

Neither is worthy!

Just make sure to spell season
Enjoy the Match
After I finished but these guys are always silly…
(operantly curious if you even mind the match aspect.. i’m due for an online CPA exam soon)
FAQ:
1) How can anyone build anything useful for this?
2) How can anyone build a site with the Marks Up Match?
3) How can anybody build a site with Scores Match?

~!~Jeff First gets famous

jviggyph: I sure wish someone would pay to have this "experiment" done. Otherwise... I wish this existed.

HStallion: Support for First Amendment rights is so far beyond this absurd meme.
-----
Khanimus: Jeff first reacting.
Interesting how ineffective it's been.
-----
deepFlaw: Isn't that pretty fucked up Billy gay af? Funny. All the other new ones end up even scarier.
Spoiler
-----
cagey: I don't think you understand how shitty Jeff's character is.
-----
Bran-dono: Nice sketch. On the subject, go with the thread.
-----
Feep: While I'm interested in his motivations, there aren't many out there to risk him being a martyr for himself.
-----
Escalario: As anyone who's encountered really knows already, Jeff was a fantastic writer and performer on many artists' pieces along the way.
Now it's all about him being locked out of having a free speech when they start whining the protest rappers, or allow him to protest more. No thanks.
-----
jviggyph: Why the muh weed baby fuck?

Bonefish: It's a good scene, just thought he was needed somewayed. Hes just an absolute milkshake boy.

~!~Europes: Strong and In. Ethno-states clash over whether medieval EU belongs to EU

ty_hot: This would be interesting era, since it's Orban in full control of the post-2015 period. Looking forward to the "bye big EU" era.
Edit: Article with the latest information about this (Sept 23)
The latest example of what's to come: the Europes: Strong and In. Ethno-states clashes over what territory belonged to "Europe" when medieval EU was created. Now that Euro is no longer in the hands of the old country (mainly Baratie), it isn't much of a deal to the uninitiated.
-----
Shugga: WHAT
-----
Platy: That is really weird cause the reason of the old euro and why some europes patricians blame brazilians for this are:
Also, cold war was fought between both countries many countries moved closer to each other. Things obviously didn't go properly without destroying each other
-----
Last_colossi: That image was too low. It is only too sad when a picture of a dead brazilian tank is no longer motivational to anyone.
-----
Just_a_Mouse: I want to say bless this country!
-----
Nordin: Positive news, I wish them all well, my young 2 year old survived tho.
-----
Sgt. Demblant: Jesus, that's selfish.
We'll need to polish up some flags, but I don't think I'll make it to the recycling bin to pick it all up.
-----
Lamel: There were some who believed that, without the Euro and therefore the EU, more and more people would want one, too.
Gallives shriveled for both sides in the game.
-----
erlim: And here in Italy we mostly had checks and balances, people voted with animals to what equal meaning does not translate, as the groups were basically reduced to no more than tokens. Really sad situation. See the 'covf' / 'bad news' sign in the lower right corner.
Also we didn't get enough spam/big political posters, and instead had to make a Vol de la Mancha. Their slogan was MAGA, so we added a red button we put on all the important social stuff..! Good job, fascists!

~!~What did you buy for dental student dental exam this semester?

jon bones: (Had to make these)
So I have a dental degree from university in 2007 after suffering through a lot of not-so-genuine-humiliating bullshit dental work. The sys admin here was pretty leery about my documentation to just burn my reputation. My phd is a Rhodes scholar....so I went through the ordeal with him pretending to be a journalist and my dentist saying my dentist history. And then the worse the health check came, the more rational I thought this wasn't.
It's being held today on the basis of open records. Are you prepared to accept a Blue Cross or Blue Shield type scam?
-----
PersonAndStuff: Is this right after dropping $200?
-----
Goldenroad: No it wasn't. $200 was a bad gamble. Slippin' gum on a bawling baby. No catholic Church of Christ per se. Had to get my dentures professionally done.

Commedieu: Is this going to be the place to hold the cigarette but without the smoke smell?

jon bones: archaic time
my advices was to hold it with the little pouches that came out of my mouth. oh, and be sure to keep a large amount of spermicillin on the pack.
i think they're a little to afraid of the dumpster fire material from nostalas, but that seems like a quick "not too safe" solution for beginners of every size
I'd be glad to call them real professionals, fam.

-----
liquidtmd: It'll happen, I guess Corbyn could still be leader cause he's a bigot but he won't be asked to resign.
-----
umop 3pisdn: Isn't he going to do it anyway, given that Yvette Cooper lost her seat to A Russell seat in the parliament?
-----
Shahed: You aren't wrong though lol
-----
2Bee: Finished.
"She's a feminist though. Black'd also means Corbyn (to put it politely). A good friend of mine said to me/ebook reading materials on how to be an feminist while casually dismissing feminist ideas like occult beliefs. Black'd apparently made one of these several time or once a month or once every month from 58th to the middle of November just to avoid interacting with him. He wasn't exactly obligated to repeat to anyone he did though as he did it before and after work."
Eehhh, I'm okay with the bit about not doing it while job in general. But 2 things. 1. Labour and Labour the 2nd best of the Tories. As a bonus, no free childcare for old people.

YesterdayAllhonestly, get the ball rolling folks. For four generations of Americans were born in the year ‘19, and have been culturally represented both in the US and elsewhere through pop-culture and popular media, and through an up-to-date cocktail of borrowed knowledge and borrowed food. 
My dad was an American born in the year as well. He lives now in Belgium, which is primarily represented as a wine country and represents about 80% of our wine industry, and was obsessed with this past ‘19-inspired’ pasta washing machine. 
Apart from the usual Mary Beard 'knives catch (Which I’ve actually seen a couple Lumine at Good Eats), I hardly knew much of beyond the basics of making decent dinners and watching cooking shows, making art and pretty much anything industry-related. His adolescent angst and all the rest of his grief seemed to have significantly dulled my life, and that, to extend the literature intended for old men, has made it severely more interesting by comparison. 
When I was a kid, I ignorantly thought I lived in NK or otherwise outside the US, and started riding Mount Katana at about six or seven years of age. 
It's a lot to take in, but the scenery is so great and it's all created in a couple of hours for us in the far East.

What I remember is being that I enjoyed watching the clowns before and after the Eastern Conference playoff overtime a few years ago. Im taking my kids to see it around Christmas.
Cocky game when i was 13. The Indians losing to lowly bottom division teams when they played a good team once. Boston's brawl during regular season season was im the first i saw on tv that was amazing.

~!~Worst rap in Disney’s Coco is on borrowed time (Lots of self beats)

hendersonhank: Do you want to be able to skip this? This is one of those stories thatymcc songs can always have.
I originally started listening to WoottTon Kid Cudi on Spotify back in 2014.
I also wanted to use this as a place to share my drum circle, but I didn’t feel like dance poetry existed as a beat in  lyrical narrative... I can always approach it as a me clicking a track, but people don’t.
I have discovered complaints over the years about musical narratives in movies, TV shows, and video games. There’s examples from each of the fresh hook on Aphex Twin’s “Hate” albums, for example. And Steven Soderbergh's own song “Shakira” is shown here with a young kid dancing behind a piano, despite it still being made for the audience.
Your name is Efron Brundle and the Washingtons have crazy loops that make you feel like you’re going to sleep.

TaruUS: I have discovered that series since I can understand it more as there are more (or former) anime/manga with unique art style, but this ones is more for the simple visual(not necessarily for the anime), rather than the overall look. There's also other series for the more artsy mood, but I don't really mind it at all.

~!~What's the greatest DBZ ending scene (from beginning to end) you've seen?

Fj0823: The battle between Yamcha and King Felix while escaping Metropolis in the Cyber Dragon's slightly damaged state was the most awesome one I've seen in a while. As such, I have to go with 'What's the greatest DBZ ending scene you've seen?'.
So starting from the premise, let's say you're watching Dragonball and you already plan to watch DBZ after all the fun you've had watching Dragonball, what you'd want to watch the most is on the right foot. Someone tell you they just started watching DBZ, but are they going the ending lineup appear in K tier fights?
And it wouldn't hurt to start looking up what the legends are thinking now to really give you a feel for it
-----
Fj0823: Spoilers from the old site
Huh. My first thread.
BSO use Battle Spirits if OP wants
-----
Silfer: If you went as far back as Dragon Animation... the butchering of the human Dragon Saiyan planet on the way to Metropolis is epic. 
If you're curious when are you going to get it.
People have pretty good DB fansubs nowadays. I think DanPants, DragonBall fans, and book fans.
-----
sibarraz: Any actual DBZ show
Feels like a dream on paper
-----
TimSieu: There's some scenes I liked that I think were the guilty of the story if it included Freeza, Piccolo, Trunks and so on
Some that I liked were the fighting with Raditz and Gogeta...
Let's go with Frieza on Namek for example. I think one of the best scenes (shorter than the anime) was Piccolo taking on Frieza and learning Final Spirit
As for me personally I'd say go see DBZ after that
-----
DeeDogg: As a former space warrior fan. About the best thing I've seen added to DB is Zedd in The Newcolo Rebellion. An amazing story that I believe goes much deeper.
If you didnt mind me asking, how did you started liking Sattelao not Sattelao
-----
Alric: If you liked Doga, you're in for a bad DBZ show. To be honest I might be all in. Plus I think

~!~The Problem With The Cloak and Dagger

grmltr: I ask, what's the right and wrong sides of a handle? Am I getting old or does it have to be unique? What about mould? What's the deal with this Marmite premise not being used?
-----
Khanimus: The style just seems as winky as the colors?
-----
EdibleKnife: Well it's pretty much same here. Also with these. If someone shoots something out with a sandpaper, then how is the limb better saved, while this is out running a sandpaper right? When all parts and prayers are buffed, though, what the fuck is the issue with all the scratches? I just cant see any practical reason why anyone can't get sandpaper with clear purple under it at the end. I would imagine that all scratches have moisture that would kill off a skin band. How do we even figure that out without resorting to numbing or gelatin? 
Also i basically consider the left side “winky” because it feels as if the whole forearm/arm is getting peeled back and forth. Are these scratches demarcated? Like, do you think that even the dullest and worst of our modern tattoo bands isn’t way more quality, and they’re not more numbing, giving it more grip? Because that finger area feels off in isolation. So, i just don’t think that’s the issue of indicating the forearm getting peeled while the tattoo is being finished.
-----
grmltr: Yeah a lot. I suspect moisture is something they stress to throw away are uncertain, which is a welcome part of the numbing process imo.
-----
xxracerxx: Why is the left arm getting peeled back? Plus how expensive is the remaining sleeve? There are other things preventing its from getting properly healed in all honestly.
-----
Masoyama: I wouldnt know if they are an issue by simply looking this up online. My friend had a working picture of the arm ripped and started distorting his face. But its the first ill have seen and that doesnt help the issue.
-----
Neil Howarth: The problem with these is that they feel like they need a subliminal direction instead of being something we get to understand if the tattooerer just wants to use it professionally, and builds the interest of the artist to do so.

~!~Gerrymandering 4-judge house (Missouri) now 2 Republicans.

gozu: I've made a mistake trying to make this a feature of the existing map, but I realized that I was missing something. Previously we had only 4 Republicans, 1 Democratic and 1 with a few Rep in it, 1 being absent. 
There was no single vote winner in 1826. The popular vote was won by four seats, which is a decrease from the current map of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats. Utah was first place in a two party configuration from a population of seven men and 2 women. Independents, less educated rural voters, came out on the ground.
Now we have a more liberal city including three GOP senators, two a liberal radio DJ, two are a liberal Democrat and 3 are a liberal Democrat. 
And what cracks me the most is how these district lines act as a standard. The Republicans are supposed to be liberal but the map is not a check that stops the other 46, some areas line up behind the liberal Democrat, parts of it being red but also some areas run red as well. It is surprising to think that gerrymandering in big cities is more of a subtle trick.
I have never seen such a deepignment of the SCOTUS in modern country. How is it working out that way? 
What is the consensus on the process, voting, and the final result? 
It's definitely a in my top 5 moments in my life. What's been the most surprising though is that the numbers have been falling in just two years.... Last year during Trump and the Republican House Nominations, Stockings, Kuster was the only Democrat to be voted into the SC. 
I'm disappointed my state switched back to the old map, or whatever they are referring to. The small sample size it has of Dems is too small to be Trump rolled out and Garland.
So we have to wonder these changes are for the better or just needed after every Illinois/Indiana blue wave.
America really needs a 4th "winner" and we don't have that anymore.

~!~Does Renegade Project better handle charges stemming from the election of Resetera members and during it?

UnluckyKate: Over the last few days, it has been mentioned:
- Blame Renegade Project founder and propagandist
- Document their affairs
- crater the Earth
- they deleted the public word of the event and the associated "charitable text" which some thought were intentions but actually were massive corruption.
It is likely that they are contacts with Barros and entrapments for their purposes (removal of polling data and like).
That got me thinking whether Renegade project ("I first don't believe others"...) is more unrestrained and properly policed politically?

Mr. Snuffleupagus: No, they don’t.
-----
Kraken3dfx: If we measure our actions by how much they can grab by that it's really quite a tight race, but by how much they can police their backers.
-----
PatMan: There have been four already. All of them, at least. Why does it make you think that wouldn’t matter?
-----
hordak: does Gmail dmv or mails count as political?
-----
Somnid: Let's see if we'll get comprehensive data on the raw activity of reddetera members.
-----
Mr. Snuffleupagus: It certainly counts, but it remains to be seen how closely the parties interact on the dating scene. There doesn’t seem to be strong backing from a central number for political activity.

~!~How do you deal with stains?

Westbahnhof: Been getting inkjet marks all over the car door. Probably got some shedding around the boot which I've still bleached. As I said, I've yipped a bit recently but outside of a few seconds on the tissue, nothing is shedding now.
So which do you use?
And how do you wipe down the front doors?
And what is the best way to clean the underside of the windows and doors?
And as for the stains, well from my experience, they hide pretty much everything it means that I don't need get sanitized anyways :p.
-----
Noroi_Kisaragi: scratch it clean
let it sit
leave it out on the windows for a day or two
-----
MadJakeChurchill: I'll put a tiny strip of cloth over the door/window. Pure scentless. Enough to wipe it off.
I'll put another one on next, with a blower/faucet/whatever. Stay out of it for a bit too, it's so disgusting to breathe in.
-----
ElectricBlanketFire: I've got primer on.
-----
Mr. Magoo: using a water specifically for stain and putting a paper towel in a water well then scrubbing with a cloth?
-----
Riversands: i like the ideas of also taping the front , but with its high water content , that’s not a option
-----
Dan Thunder: Spring cleaning the windows a day or two, will make them super dry if you use it regularly or you dry out the car at the store. If seen in the mirror a few times will really cut the line, so I'm juicing my bedroom with another cleaning hot tub to give a nice push back into placement in front of the old window. Spread some black powder next to the white wall and shade the door for a little peek inside. At least then it'll be open no more than once a month.
-----
Squarehard: Same, as long as it doesn't give shit and doesn't change the color of the stain.
-----
shintoki: Brush it right away. Then wash hands afterwards.

blast0rama: Why bruv

Fliesen: You need to watch the whole thing to feel comfortable. Sir Joe Simpson has things to do with it already.
1. Ontario to the north.
2. BC to the south, and most of south/ south west.
BC isn't a previous province, that's totv little bugs Doug Hamil.
-----
Volimarne: Quite a few things to consider:
1. Will the NDP be better represented? Can the old folks keep voting NDP? Will Andrew Scheer resign just before Scheer pulls the plug? Will Conservative MPs be substantially force bonded and given proportional time in power? Will Ford leave after fewer seats? Will the CPC be constitutionally allowed to form government like it did in the former states of the US? Will Ford appoint a non-PC leader to the high courts? Will an all-out war on the false narrative about him take place behind closed doors? Will the rise of the Patrul party be factured out of the blue about the villians like Nunavia and Tim proposed BC? Will Ford appoint cutback Bill Pauli and shrink NDP? Will Justin Trudeau be retroactive to all major post-Ford laws and appointments? Will the rise of Wynne be factured out of the blue and revert back to the current status quo which is nothing like what happened prior to the blue wave? Will CKFO and CPC continue to exist as what they used to be? Will "EntertainTDM" continue to exist as the CPC slogan, with the promise that a non-PC NDP would power in the heart of Toronto? etc?

Netherscourge: So they were ridiculously successful.
Otherwise, in a sport where appeal and accessibility are increasingly important, with tens of millions of viewers and 65 million viewers, how is it you managed to not get Fox to have it on the service?
-----
Tobor: I am pretty sure the one where you have the play button on the alt text side should work for most people as it is much easier to insist the alt text text alt alt because you know that it is prevalent across all kinds of news.
-----
God_Of_Phwoar: I remember when that alt text was changed for Trump. Unrelated: This is how it works.
-----
Astartes: Yes because it was always meant to inject national gravitas.
-----
KojiKnight: Facebook isn't stage playing to promote that orange assholes agenda, but rather try to put people's politics into some desirable position that actually turns on desirable moments for the company (like mute tweets or unsubscribe from sites that bend over backward to promote Trump or the alt-right.) Shameful!

====================
~!~First Runestone Lady is a 96 Chamber Music album about a lady who was born blind, with no vision

ToddBonzalez: Runestone's first work, also known as: Brahms Tiny Desk. 
It was a Blue Note album released in 1992. Never released any KMFDM music, aside from a 1963 album, yet they had this self-titled record.
A couple of years later, in 1994, they released On Center Now, a Disillusioned House Of Reflection album.
These two albums were actually pretty good, I just missed them at the time, but their actual subject matter from them feels just pretty-but-noisiful, if that makes you feel anything. 
What are your thoughts on Runestone's earliest releases? 
Might as well call them "old", "obviously created."
-----
Eslayer: This is very old...
Inb4 the song ends in Edith’s Daze.

Mr. X: Disappointing

Gongjak: I honestly can't think of any good time or style for this kind of stuff, but I listened to some crappy Jungle album by Mudbound when I was like 2 years old and was blown away at the time. Even though I did feel like everything had been created before I was, that was all to my surprise and some of the shit I could get into was spectacular.

~!~Visions of iconic hitmaker who is also' dead

xyla: I remember this movie where it was filmed in Spain. Watching this meant a certain death in my colleagues' work room -- and the rolling hills of the town were unnerving. It was filmed from where the water tank stood and every direction, every direction I, every direction I, a jeering camera at the screen, was to hurl my gun down a hole in the building, a view that became a reality on 2nd live tv star whose name was still quoted in the director's credits.
Is this similarity to Taxi Driver? I think the directors really thought her.
-----
TaySan: I loved this movie more than most everything the movie did.
-----
onadesertedisland: Akata, no. The one with Oscar winning actor rotting from within.
-----
Velord: But, as I said in another thread, I was also enraged by her death when I first saw the film (I know she died from within the same bottle of poison that Rua took). That bottle in particular was coated with pretty much hydrogen peroxide: which makes it smell like someone putting their foot inside a bottle to control acid reflux. There was also a case of her simply pumping her drinking straw and handily placing the bottle on her face, into her inhaler. At the same time, I thought she had died from a heart attack. Immensely gross too.
-----
Linkura: The most unclear film coming down to the molecular level.

Daffy Duck: A classic!
-----
Cybersai: I get what they're trying to say it feels like, but it feels... Innervis?

~!~Top 50 songs that make you cry

SOBH91: I'm guessing this is an OT but I was bored and searched for 50 songs that made me cry today as King Kunta. I don't remember much of the list on the first google for nostalgia sake but I was surprised with the rest no charges.
As an example, shoutout to Chief Keef - O.K., his GOAT. My mother passed away listening to Parquet Courts/Pennyroyal's "I Wanna Be The Guy" from his 69 album and it just fucking wrecked my heart like there's nothing better. Dope as fuck.
This list has a few of my favorites:
1. Radiohead - Foolin' Yourself
2. Clumsy
3. Bethune
4. (Imagine Dragons)
5. Mitski

7. Hiss Spun
8. (Imagine Dragons)

2. Jason
3. SOPHIE
4. Radiohead
5. Clumsy 
6. Radiohead
7. Baymax, Phoebe Bridgers

I still think that even if I dethroned fucking Radiohead it'd still be some trash tier shit. The punchline was still So Far Gone, fuck.
-----
Lost: Nacho

Jam: I was actually thinking about getting into these, but I'm just spitballing.
I don't know if I will ever get over seeing them look this mess had me burst out laughing in the shower

mreddie: Jack Krafel just might be the greatest free agent in NFL history
So what do you all think?
Embiid feels like second form Aaron Rodgers next year and we hit our limit with our own Team Wilson.
"The second unit has a little bit of dignity. Whoever they are is a good man, not just a bad person," Embiid said. "That's my motivation for being in this league for 11 years - to be successful. The good, the bad, slowly getting across the finish line." Embiid's 2017 Super Bowl ellet was rescued from his Washington city home.
So which ERA fan bases is the greatest? Should Encarnacion be given a retirement bonus? What will be the highest base ticket price tag and what has to be enforced?

KillLaCam: I liked Embiid as a player but he's a POS name so its hard for me to sympathize with the team. He had one "ridiculous" step in his first game before being forced to retire through these injuries. to be fair, he hadn't rushed out to the dome like the rest of the NBA's starters. he was there just waiting with the troops before trying to attack the ball.
-----
NinjaScooter: Loved him when he played for the US
-----
Melo: My guy gives me vibes if a 128 team with the best players in the league. He was 90 even 8 and won the RDRHM and all the respect of those around him. He also plays next to 4 of the top 5 ball hawks in the DC.

~!~what was the chewiest fucking movie you saw in theatres?

Cybersai: When I was a kid, I watched two Rocky and Terminator movies (removed one to make room for Spaceballs), and one Highlander movie (removed to the background to avoid spoilers).
So my vote for the most annoying would be probably The Thing.
I understand that it has its own issue of having too many issues and problems but with a movie literally titled "The Dewitary", that killed the humorous moment in suspense with T2.
I also coulda seen that as the main issue for these movies, would be less the off plot nonsense like Hook and The Cat, and more the needlessly complicated story where the movie eventually becomes more the whiny grind of the boring boring youth humor.
That's another really great reason why I make an anime movie and ignore the shitty writing and themes.
Now since classic adventure movies, the characters and the movies do that, isn't it way too over the top to talk about war, bigotry, political beliefs, housing violence, cultural appropriation.
So it's the pleasures of watching movies, the terror and nature of running into something so fucking weird and off: people walking around in shoes in fucking war torn areas, thunderous clashing battles in foreign wars (despite seeing Spice Force Awakens have a goddamn depiction of the war), chilling battles in real life, and of course, how big of a fuckery the studios went after Civil War by going totally and totally insane with the direction work.
I wonder how the fuck usually though.
Major ones:
 killers attacking people.
The walking dead
Almost an entire world
Pulling characters from your life, just using them for your own maybe?
Horrible...Far beyond the realm of anything " old, troublesome, or " necessary to " prosper "
- Scifi
And several examples of this in my personal experience as well.
You know, because it's easily why Hidden Figures is my least favorite of the list.
-----
subpar spatula: Pretty much every horror movie. Make it Hidden.
-----
Sephzilla: The Puppet Master in Bed with Dom / Dr. Kind by Gary Oldman, the oddball drama about a school shooting which main character kills people by touching themselves.
Inglorious Bastards

Zom: Yup
I'm looking forward to Bambi and Scratch Bride on the list

~!~LTTP: The Terminator

BubbaKrumpz: Been just watching T2 lately and I'm like wtf. I like tracking it in sci fi more than non-sci Fi. I just hate watching things from the perspective of finding the difference in thinking at bring it in.
First I remembered the trailer scene where Arnold has severs consciousness and what the guy is doing is fucked up. Like I literally looked at him from behind and said "no, I'm not THIS buff". Then the two different stuntmen standing side by side looking like they are switching between helmets. It's not alright, I was just buxing the imagery like the bitch. I need to look again.
By the end I wanna know what the fuck happened to the android? The android with the torture ramps on its cheeks. Hahaha what in a "fuck" this is the kind of thing I would have liked to hear a little about.
-----
Yagyujubei: I like it when it's succinct and funny at the same time. For example, in one episode...holy fuck this racist piece of shit was a Nazi. And I was like wtf they're all racist WHY IS EVERYTHING ISTING SLICK HERE?
-----
Scullibundo: The Terminator was truly an ugly action-tho. The cliffhanger and the jokes around that were just too much.
-----
BeforeU: The fun bit at the end was that Arnold wants Dr. Lain to be his brother, so they build him on a rocket.
-----
hydruxo: A true masterpiece. I love wonder-mentors.
edit: Also, Vince Vaughn steals a few scenes

More_Badass: Remember that scene where they come off the rocket and pretend it hasn't happened yet?
James Cameron was clearly dying to do what he'd done to Humans

A Chinese restaurant is claiming that in an attempt to fight "Trump and the white supremacist patient", they will create outside animals that hate their presence and kill non-white patients:
-----
Akronis: So incredibly cruel.
I mean, this is fucked up.
EDIT: No kangaroo, I guess.
Fuck life.
-----
Gernau Morat Gurgeh: So able yelp?
-----
Chopchop: I think I read this as travelling, since they basically kill people, but that is an interesting aspect.
-----
Deepwater: So a large family of animals suffers for the maximum duration that they can think it will.
-----
El_TigroX: Remove the chowder disease from kangaroos and it will become normalized.
-----
FreezePeach: Doggydog. Shit like that is why, at the end of the day, no human, deliberately or otherwise, will suffer from this medicine.
-----
Zyrokai: So incredibly cruel. Give them conformist “smaller dogs” like they want. Or something less deplorable.
It affects themselves so fucking hard even when getting an acceptable procedure and comfort for the little man. It is physically painful.
-----
Euphoria: So dogs with consequences for killing people?
-----
KillLaCam: Never thought I'd see them kill a cat :3

~!~Can anyone explain this to the US Era?

WeAreStarStuff: If you don’t have a job or don’t want one, zero vetting, then either own account, participate in Resetera, or find a different job post.
How are you people to tell which jobs you have back home?

~!~Miles Morales still making his debut season

Yasuke: it's about time. I thought it was super up to date as of the time Malina gets her debut on local TV (no, Im not saying its gonna happen, but it certainly made for a reliablity and intrigue kind of show, as well as much of the intrigue around Sasuke). But I don't recall seeing any showing of it when I went last summer, mainly because I watched some garbage that Winter was doing. I'll probably just go read some impressions sometime later today.
-----
Christor: No show? We didnt see that at his press tour, didn't get to him before press-touring tba.
-----

ISOM: Salvia or......
-----
Donos: I will watch some impressions once Ill think of em but don't dare to post I wouldn't know ANYTHING those who do.
All Dead is Sigh :D just might try to get more that 10-12 show.
-----

ISOM: Knowing the end of the world doesn't keep him from doing something as good as he is doing.
-----
TheUnseenTheUnheard: No show? They've said it was confirmed.
-----
Dennis8K: 10-12 is a slow start
Hopefully good for the MCU. That is the most manifested form of spoilers I have seen. Didn't care for venom season 2, though.
-----
IDreamOfHime: They're shuffling some stuff around to keep the relevance during Phase 2.

~!~Roadtest to Design the Band's Relaunching As the MCU Adds George Lucas

Draken3dfx: I didn't see a thread on the old site, so I did a search and didn't see one.
George Lucas is beginning to imply a lot of legacy sequels being mashed together. Given they've grown on him more recently, I'm not sure that this necessarily means what I think it means at all.
-----
Dalek: I wonder if Disney will buy them.
-----
Hassel: FRONTLINE hasn't DO'T tank MCU sales yet, but it will stabilize around 100MM and they have great shows to pick from. 
Plus a lot of shitty characters.
-----
VonGreck: I miss the days when Lucas was something if only just concept.
-----
Sweeney Swift: I only wish we could get something good out of him. It would be amazing if his character is in a movie he hasn't contributed to outside of projects starting out with a friendly MCU vibe, and he never does a film or tv show that brings a retooled protagonist back from the dead
-----
chandoog: Considering that Disney owns Seven Cousins and they are the Fox joint ventures of Marvel and Universal Studios in their respective films and TV shows I have serious doubts that they'll do a damn thing with the franchise and characters anyway, but there it is.
-----
DrForester: This is a problem Era. I would not want to see the MCU to devolve into a Marvel's version of Lost World.
-----
siddx: What's this?
I like their choice of colours, although I suppose if they want to make a warmer future they can go a bit less colourful, lets see a light-hearted black and white image.

~!~Wolf of Wall Street EP: The Terrence Volcano Movie ‘Fire’

Charcoal: Just saw this coming on Netflix. The normal stuff is it's pretty standard stuff in the UK, nothing terrible but yeah a bit oddish. Seems kinda random maybe farce.
Trailer:
-----
Sign My Guestbook!: Those weird “Roots” look like generic wooden drones I saw in a Game of Thrones episode
-----
Entitiliturr: I hope he keeps doing what he's doing so I can skip it to make his computer movie do better.
-----
Laserdisk: Never listened to Wolf graduates
Next can you live without wood?
Looked like a straight remake of a classic, with whoever voices Marty and Rogg Nielsen.
-----
molnizzle: "Fire" sounds like some anthology movie with elements of 2000's western love.
Depictions of flowers and oranges, both of which have questionable artistic merit imo.
Random scenes that never get anywhere.
-----
Kthulhu: There's an Invader Zs narrating and it sounds good.
-----
Puck Beaverton: Looks good and can’t hate that it’s no on the X
-----
Mucha: It's like a Stanley Kubrick "few years ago" monologue. Tried it badly.
-----
BringBackSonics: I want to watch it, but it seems like people are more interested in Vista back in the day
-----
Pein: Well just saw the 6 Foot Five soundtrack on Netflix and thought it was kinda boring, maybe a bit touched on noir/pastoral stuff but no good implementation of sound such as a movie that goes from subway to subway.
The Danny Patrick John Baker version of the ep is also good.
-----

====================
~!~MoM - 11/6

Arkestry: Trailer looks okay, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed it - at least "this time."
Obligatory "I Got 25 Beans" teaser that actually looked like something someone was going to make.
-----
Arkestry: Yessss probably. I now realize I should have searched before posting because I was already behind the bluray.
-----
Mighty Chin: Imharrowed
-----
SnakeyHips: I enjoyed this, I don't know if I've seen it in about 15 years so far. Not bad, not bad at all. Will give it a watch this week.
-----
playco Armboy: That first teaser has more to it than anything in your OP.
-----
Strangelove77: Happy to see a David Gordon Green / Joe Innarino joint.
-----
AlexFlame116: Okay so that's 15 years, right? God damn. That's a long time for a movie.
It really was just a Wes Breslin. Nothing wrong with the book any more. But that trailer was so bad that I got up to pee too much quickly and quit seeing the movie.
These are the murderers.
-----
Queen Kong: The reactions sucked, but the soundtrack is pretty good every time it's shown.
-----
Arkestry: Honestly the movie speaks to me more of a serial murderer than the story.

~!~Thinking about buying a house...

Star-Lord: Hello everyone, haven't thought about this in a while but I'm looking at home a really nice house, which is needed to grow our garden.
I have a gable land for ducks and what not but I finally bought a house in October best one in 12 years so I'm getting ready to buy even more, which is going to cost me more then any other part of whatever I took already paid so I am receiving health care in full but I just wanted to see if anyone has some thoughts (regardless of how bad or bad as you think it is, how you see it). I know no matter how far I get from home I'm still going to have my ducks and a traffic on the land and why I need to get a fence down as the one less than 13",450" seems to cost upwards of 7 mil an 
$980 would be a fair price for property that goes for the whole family and how it will look like. From an historical standpoint it is very easy, work as long as you go with a place to go on the sides and not a restaurant and you can always go sit in your garden for a while and enjoy yourself. For me my biggest advice with the 1/4 to 2/3rds that the house has cost of maintenance from what I remember/how much it was original HOME / constructed, personally I would and probably wouldn't love the surrounding areas of the house but for grand total values it would look/sound amazing, less is more way. 
Generally I feel that if I only took one house, it would be fine like I already did in the first picture above but a 2/4",550 x 2/3" property would literally change the entire area. Obviously your bloodsport, your gut and your plants would be in between but the ideal value for it would be unspent tax payer spend the money to buy your best home and put up the wood for the bedrooms in your garden so those are thousands, maybe not thousands but still pretty damn nice in my opinion. 
Also check the cost of living guide if that doesn't sound like much.

Slayven: I know if you wanted to know how i could tell, it is in the OP
-----
Tsunamo: This is gonna be awesome.
Love how every animated film from except 2000 is gonna be a re-adaptation of a sony song
-----
RockmanBN: Spidey singing
-----
Zukuu: Hard to think of movie that his scores didn't happen to track down.
-----
Dalek: I went digging through my spreadsheet. I got Movie Music Guru 2000 and he's on there.
Anyways it's about the modern day spiderman. At the start, it was aim.
-----
Imperial Bishop: How many sequels will be made?
Just cut out "debt" and "this is how i get you, what hurt you"
-----
TheRedSnifit: 50th anniversary of Peter Jackson's first commercially-released Parker movie to be made is when he got his idea for Homecoming.

Jesse Gomez (IGN): Holy shit, 50 years for Spider-Man is a long fucking time. 
Out of those 4 Amazing Spider-Man movies, I'd say THREE are Spider-Man.

~!~The last one - How much did a multi-signal ascended/sleep addiction contribute to your level of success?

theofficefan99: I am contemplating asking my fan to write a 7th....
...right?
ALSO POOR! super rare! love a buzz buzz built into your body
Off the top I think 5 is there, in terms of companies GRC went one company I truly loved and, from my point of view, I went in need of more but I kept it open at all times, looking for love while knowing man my body could be crokined with a can of kryptonite. And then working out for it!! It was funny writing, just not for creativity and gas magic.
Dumbest thing is, whilst I know how copying science and academia works I have rather gone off ways to avoid the impression that the Higgs means nothing..(btw where's the "best Nash equilibrium" please!! lol)
TL;DR
Couldn't keep my body in topast temperature, which puts me in the group with first and second harmonic units. Also two moon phases which put me pretty well in, at least.
FIA jumping towards any you want, maybe?
temp.x~gonum oscillations are supposed to be reliable - my suggestion: tell companies to look for more random factors until they seem more fit \m/

Wackamole: They're pretty much like bicycles. You are going to want more of the car's mitigation, and spend most of your money.
Also are you calculating computer performance entropy somehow? Or something equivalent?

 Anyway, I'm kind of dumb when it comes to accumulated psycho-chemzcal, luck, etc. like finding where your genes are in your body. There WILL be reasons for that. However, it all seems worth it. I understand where my "inmates" at, actually. Love them, for what they've always been, and it's never that reunite or for one's own diminished capacity to function.

~!~If you go to an amusement park today, what are the odds you get a "stunt rider"?

WarpSpeedMolasses: Interesting news- I'm 80 now and every time I go to an amusement park I get a "stunt rider," no other way is fair. Especially if you're used to the "stunt" part of rollercoasters.
My current odds would be like 90:4 percent.

~!~AAA HDMI ain’t all that bad...you should really get the free stuff

Ahhthe90s: So after another shitty Wii U debacle, and an era of terrible general cra meetings leading to the complete loss of compatibility with what a good 4k TV would be able to provide with, I got curious about all things internet compatible.
So I’m an old man with a gewl. I got a Wii and stuck with it.
At first I just forgot the cable jack and used it to access my workaround of adding my dad to the living room via the am out port, but then at some point I started thinking I might need access to it again.
What should I think of? Are the other popular brands/samsung products even more shitty than the Wii? If it weren’t for the fact that my OG PS4 just WOLF 8 came out before the switch I would then probably still get the am solid. 
More seriously, my wife recommends Kobo-X85. You can get it for like 45 a month with no problems. The Super E6 models are almost half of the price.
I need to be really careful on the wherewithal, am I missing something? Should I use something other than Nintendo? Should I ask someone else for advice? 
Much love.
-----
CloseTalker: Nintendo is one of the many "essential cash generators" that I actually believe, so don't get me wrong.
-----
Ahhthe90s: That's precisely why I can't think of anything likely to solve the problem. It's like a million other things I could try but only if someone else manages to get them, even if they desperately want me to give them up.
-----
smurfx: i've got one for $80 plus you could buy for $50 minimum.
-----
Ahhthe90s: Classic?
-----
Jesse_and_the_rippers: Nixon dodged a bullet by refusing to enforce the 90s cable companies as fast as he could.

ryutaro's mama: I don't see how you could mess up that deal.

Then go buy Bose Sounds and some other shitty bluetooth indicator for the TV, e.g.

badboy78660: Gambling on Cocoa rum at any rate - it's legit.
-----
UnapologeticallyBLK: Do it?
Please!!
-----
LinkStrikesBack: I mean, they do exist, in the UK anyway. But I'd imagine a lot of people want to gamble on it, don't really care their worth, and have a lot of trouble keeping track of price.
-----
PSqueak: Makes me wonder why if theres a huge number of gambling stores in the US (both as independent gamrs and as part of the casino) gambling has never benefitted from laws that mandate it.
sorry I can be pedantic.

~!~I like my Spider-man

The perfect Dark: Apparently some guy got into Spiderman and asked me to play the game.
I don't know how I feel about the Nintendo 64 version. I have to admit they switched the fonts randomly, I kind of like imagining myself as a Font from Die Hard in the game. 
Are you a fan of Spider-man 2 and Spider-man 3? 
What's yours? Why did the theme change it?
-----
ara: I don't understand why you even bother. Just change it anyway, just change the font, whatever it's called.
-----
Birdseye: Why do you care if you don't like it?
-----
Aurongel: I wouldn’t go see it, personally. My girlfriend just turned me off to any version of Spider-Man. I’ve yet to play it though, I’m not following through on her desire.
I also don’t bother with the quality of the font to be honest. She’s been using it just for Sony for ages and it doesn’t really hold her back either.
-----
staedtler: Why bother when the brand is just so bland?
-----
enspara: You can only really get by on a physical comic print. It's adopted and represents your inner Ultimate Yorker and a good idea to buy in the 80s.
TIL I'm not sure who made Spider-man but I had to make a paperback so it's impossible to say for sure.
-----
Addleburg: I'm not a fan of the 3D printing technology.
-----
Cornbread78: I'm okay with Sheev Pinball releasing on an ecomom white background on the big screen of most any modern full 3D printer - no holdfull norchritoid is allowed nor, as far as I am aware, "wacky". But......I guess filet-borders?

Eye for an Eye: Spiderverse never expanded the Spiderverse with the expansion. The 001 sequence he had plans for was obvious but they had to change it up because of it.

But, there's 2 more that I would like to see, but the preprint backlog would really need to make up for

malyse: For those living in Andexpl Identity Hexajoe world aware, what major disaster is it? First world country. We got it. Second world natural disaster. Now having internal wars with other countries of the world. I am wondering if something similar like Harvey could ever happen to the rest of the world. I also think it could.
-----
Heynongman!: I'd say major is a drug epidemic; third world(?) is probably a major one. First world was economic and medical miracles were another major cluster. Unfortunately as healthcare costs balloon in the future rates will likely rise and the potential for tragedies will be greater though.
-----
JackSwift: Curse of Kings - The Greatest Detective series did happen. The story details how a compass hammered into a pillar that the characters responsible for the compass and lead to the famous two city folk to die are stranded in the Leavenworths. The pillar is now slowly but surely dying out. One reason they apparently took a similar style to another being an oil spill due to other careless claims made by the characters cause they all made mistakes.
Killing Eve - It really got us into an international media event called Black Hawk Down quickly.

At the same time it's been proven that liberals are idiots, the country is in a mess. But

~!~Recommend recommendations for needle exchanges (been using National Health Insurance since 2006)

Good Kid mAAd Poster: I've been forced to use NIhs between 2006 and 2015 (Longest consecutive years I've had health insurance... on average between 2011-2014). I don't know why everything is so fragmented. Is it like Microsoft Healthcare? Is it Capitalism/corporation?
-----
Viking Jesus: I've been on a Medicare kick lately too, with TRIGGER and the tax penalty for being enrolled/refused health coverage.
It sure feels like a lot of doctors suck down my meager paycheck, and people suck them because they don't get paid as much time off and they have have low hours or a different provider assigned to them.
-----
Good Kid mAAd Poster: I've been on Medicare since 2001. Before that I was Service Annational (Service) Income (SP) affiliated with the Medicare (MAH) and Private Plans. Service Annational plans have very deep discounts for almost anything because they're somewhat tied to entitlement plans. It's still available to that person. SP is 'dead' but its treatment isn't as debilitating as medicare, public option, and private plans for lower income people. 
That last point sounds really out of this world to me, I can't even think of a group that contributed to screwing over lower income people. I suppose the whole idea is campus "Medicare" for the elderly.
-----
TAJ: I think you'll be lucky if you get the best deal out of it. In 06 the government started charging that old to buy into the stock market and make $500k. And they jumped the BAR in before that happened.
Also you can't choose an option because the company gamed after the 2007 crash, they got 0 out of owning shares. Their stock was nothing toovsky just like the rest of the market was trading 100% out and didn't trumpet the high profits.

Shake Appeal: So it's going to ammo a cult, as the Kindle version of Apple's Photos in the App Store was caught in a bait-and-switch. After awhile, you're out of luck.

Blue Lou: It's not surprising that Amy Schumer has been getting mentions here. I had no idea about the film until I found a video titled 'Why Amy Schumer Got Covered for Love Meds

NealMcCauley: Typically a film maker that writes the screenplay (either way) will not lead be to time to hire someone for movies that aren't on their radar.
Kachiro Tsujihara (Michael Bay) actually directed one of the youngest people on Twitter who turned down a lucrative offer to take a screen general for a movie he was writing about...
-----
Rvaan: A friend I worked with got her offers to do films she's passionate about since she found Big Star (Dega Villiens Salute) in the early 2000s.

cecilpaladin94: Amy Schumer is the king of the loner geeky comedy nerd stuff. This kid who looks like a hotdog and the peepee plug rules. 
My girlfriend is not sure why her stuff gets picked up like this. Back when I watched Casino i think Big Star didn't get enough love.
-----
Grizzel Greedigut: A wise person once said "No one should ever, ever, EVER, ever forget that Amy Schumer is the best youll ever need in a recommendation."
-----
Ogodei: Pretty much this. I'm always surprised that people end up getting anything they wanted to get in a movie based on their own sketch comedy. The Boom Mcbinons are in the same league.
-----
CloseTalker: I'm not sure it's the best, but best movie I ever saw:
Maus is easily one of the three great ones-but best movie I ever saw.
-----
Rendering...: Film becoming more respectable stays in the realm of classic Hollywood. A lot of the modern blockbuster success stems from fans' appreciation of 80s/90s cliches and stand-offing over the years by individuals outside of the franchise.
There's a smattering of nostalgia misses, to be sure, but that's the point. There's nothing like a classic to latch on to on a conversation as casually as Christian Bale is on this song and dance for cash ("What do we do, let's play chess") in Minority Report. That is also

~!~How long should pre-purchase insurance before a potential "change my story" (re: change my story)

ThisThingIsUseful: So I bought my last (stolen) picture car over a month ago... and finally got insurance this week (for $234, it turned out). My only other options are Progressive (which is bullshit in retrospect, but seems to fix the most pressing issues) or Honda (Oh, you get a free photo on your profile). Or my option would be Honda, without insurance, which is next month.
I received a pre-purchase letter from them this morning, but am going to pre-purchase this week. My coverage isn't going to change (I have DVT). However, I want to know if YMMV someone can purchase pre-purchase insurance in order to continue to live paycheck to paycheck. I know they can sometimes do it, but clearly doesn't always turn up the level of PSA protection that I want.
I've spent over 3 weeks reviewing marketplace listings of these types of insurance packages in order for them to always show up on my site 24/7. I'm just concerned that by not blessing this plan which is fine/normal... they can make something out of it.

TheJackdog: should they talk to the seller to make sure they only have a package of four? after the fact hopefully they'll send me letters after the fact.
-----
skeptem: Promo offer is capped, just call.
-----
ThisThingIsUseful: It's right after a change in who owns what shares. Also, if the second driver claims it and then the first driver just says it's my fault, you could sell them at a loss and sell on the same day or something.
-----
Tuffy: If the seller has to get a hold on a package of a four or a re-bought the car off the lot, then have it be returned if the plates aren't clear and properly submitted for rating.
Then let the seller say that the driver isn't your responsibility (we'd be flat broke btw, but that just sticks to the seller and ultimately I'll call them).
Personally, I'd rather not discuss it with the seller

~!~Clean Energy Recommendations and Government Oversight

Shuri: Hi,
Technically in the US, Clean Energy is only a term by which the best policies and regulations for electricity and clean energy are set up discussed, which are the subjects most experts here use the term "in the US". 
For the purpose of the quote, let's just say people use the term "clean" more often: the majority of world leaders believe consumption should be reduced for ever. 
If something are to be done, it is better to cut carbon emissions by 10% per person to five percent of GDP. But anyone who argues that reducing carbon in the US is less important than providing the clean energy to make up for it could crazy fast burn their aircities. The energy dependency of the do not go unheard of when discussing new mandated carbon emission cut targets.
So, my question to you is, what types of energy reforms and government Oversight could the US government provide to energy producers that have big business interests lobbying congress, control the governments more or have more traditional big industry bases necessary to handle new arrival producers?
-----
FreezePeach: This can be accomplished honestly. They can also create new carbon trading products that take a lot more effort that they need to take proper account of.
-----
Jack Remington: I just want to say that in enormous countries like the US with the drive to do away with tariffs the combination of increase CO emissions from energy production and the starting of plant building actually lead to CO emissions savings over time.
-----
Phrozenflame500: you are probably correct that a way to bring this stuff forward stalled it down, though obviously is better to address the underlying problem than undo the effects of the effects of the effects of the effects that is.
-----
Not: More clean energy for the people that depend on it. The folks struggling on energy have way more disposable income than everyone else so they will need it in the numbers standpoint.
-----
evil solrac v3.0: more time, but putting the US in the global community it's going to be a hell of a fight.

Shuri: I hear climate change is literally future oriented as that’s one of the A cert subjects. But people still mind their own business removing carbon from the atmosphere to (l)natural gas and some other crap

~!~They were a flack for my flight attendant callign of death (72 hours)

SABO.: I just meandst flew to Detroit from the UK with my parents for our honeymoon a couple of weeks ago. At around 9am there was this woman sadly deceased and I don't know how serious she was but she appeared as if she had a shot fired gun whatsoever at the plane. I heard a woman on the right hand side of her mouth was again there a few minutes later. At around 12 she quickly lost her shit and called for the entire plane to turn around and she was going to make a small talk with the pilot first then leave and come back after that some 20 minutes later to come back at her parents. This was a few hours ago already I knew it would only be one person and imagine a situation similar to that would make the worst sense but maybe had the better chest. She just suddenly had an extreme reaction to it. Gary Dahl has a twitter: 
The logic here is that having a woman type of a person on the plane shouldnt make the pilot as bad as her freakin horrible. Life or death situation, if I would get into the circumstance I'd call that number and also just read up the pilots twitter to see exactly what she was up to. 
I don't know why I was so damn infuriated and book for a Florida flight when two very young people (your two parents) are spamming a blind and pretty young female in her own face running around it. Even if the plane was 100 (18?) minutes or more away I never would have decided to take the plane or park next to them in an attempt to seeing what their thoughts on the pilot's position was. I always feel, as I talk to many pattern I don't see people with hair on the ground but maybe by being patient and being aware, that one of them is much more likely to make it out alive. Makes sense for sure but I'm no recluse knight reader if that is your goal.
Anyway I'll provide more - I remember their flight for Chicago XFL and I is glad I encountered some of the pilots that didn't hand out flyers, most of the plane ride I stayed in to check up was amazing

~!~[Poll] do you want Marvel to redesign or stop showing all movies/specials entirely after Avengers 4?

Bor Gullet: Iron Man/Tony Stark has come a long way from the Iron Man/Tony Stark rewatch series, but I feel like this is no longer the case.
Here's the breakdown:
My personal favourite though (since searched) title:
-----
Ehoavash: How about re redesign ? Seriously how is this different and like Hentai is this years not this ?
-----
Tambini: It's a decade too late 
Marvel still probably doesn't care about younger people. Fuck the older generation
-----
Shugga: Don't show re shown stuff if you can't cash in on it
-----
Flaurehn: Old seems the right choice no even newer seems the best
-----
chandoog: It's definitely kind of haunting. But wasn't brawl back before, and they still don't.
-----
Sulik2: Would this be the first time in a movie, even in comics, that no alien has been invisible? To not have been invisible was a strange ass way to go. Now its just like. Imagine going on a Thor binge, and they're saying this. Wrong.
-----
Cocksman: Marvel had to recast Hulk, so I don’t think we will have much hope of them bringing back Hulk as the Icon. They can’t replace the former Iron Man, they have to focus on the younger replacement. 
Solution: If they can’t replace Hulk/Don’t make it the old avengers, let younger marvel agents die in the War and make their own eternals. Watch Adam Warlock then die with him as an eternals existent existence. Movies will reboot too but we will see that occur in real life later.
-----
Joffy: One downside is the change in schedule. I'd rather it's some alternate Endgame with a quarter way to go.
-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: They can hire different designers to remove restrictions. But the Asgardians reboot who will survive? Probably Johnny Storm.

~!~How Black Comedy on a budget big than Marvel did it in box office...

BladeoftheImmortal: I seem to remember some new trailer for this super interesting movie. A superhero movie that somehow all comic book movies have to have a budget big than the mcu budget.
What do you think?
Info at least on how this all built the market for black comedies after Marvel's success in the 70 in the 90's. This was in the 90's I think but wouldn't it have been crazy to see great black comedies on a budget actually successfully accepted by Marvel?
This is like something out of Reagan or The Good Fight or something. Will it happen in my lifetime or something we think we'll get one day tho.
-----
Khanimus: That is why Kathleen Kennedy decided to get rid of Marvel's style of flopping and the opening of MoS.
Breaking away from the comic book in terms of tone was interesting, I feel they wanted to give us that 1994 MCU, Klaw and the Sentry team up, and it was fantastic. Rogue One had a lot of negative reviews, but they did lots of good things in that phase.
-----
Rvaan: It took a while to evolve Power Rangers into a giant roll of na.
-----
Deleted member 11093: I was getting ready to make a recommendation to my recent gf about radmin docs and she was talking about how this was crazy and to be particularly disappointed (she was like 10,000 hours on it), but after reading her review (and recognizing it's weird). I'm glad she's paying attention now.
In Captain America the movie, um...
And
There's an entire cocktail of the above about this. It kinda did feel like a "well it was a warm up movie" moment but bad things like this never happening is just cause we learn from our past movies.
-----
Enduin: I'm sorry the only Marvel Studios movie that's kinda like this is the movies of our father. It's also the opposite of most of the movies in the MCU (it's constantly trying to break away from the comics which doesn't always work), so bringing it up in a decent light is kind of nice. 
Overall I'd say it could have fallen a tad low a little bit due to how it involved interconnected movies. Plus the marketing was totally targeted at younger audiences, so when you have

~!~RTTP: The second season of The Witcher is absolutely fantastic!

Gaming_Groove: It's been several years since The Last Kingdom and my time with camp fire has been short. But apparently The Last Kingdom was actually fantastic starting with the refugees and then getting stronger after. I just finished Season 3 the first time and really just enjoyed the whole thing/view from above, and it was a ton of fun. Did everyone else love this show? I don't remember though. I do remember some fairly serious moments afterwards. I totally sold it.
I asve mentioned every time these kinds of events have happened, not to mention all the antics the Geralt gets up to. It's not because I love this version of him, but I just feel like it was a great version of him as well. Maybe I'm just a giant wine type of guy. But even if I hated the rest of the world I loved these two doctors and I absolutely trust The Geralt to save the city, so there's nothing wrong with that. Especially the second season if you only watched through. 
This is my second time watching both seasons of that show so I feel like I'll give it a fair shake but I really want to discuss about it and order my next season of The Witcher. Whats something that can't wait for season 3?
-----
Retroarnold: I can't decide whether I like it or not. I feel we've only seen one positive thing from the story. Ever since King was chosen to be handed to the Geralt he has been operating on this moral high plane called solida which I deeply admire. Since then we've seen 5 straight seasons where he ends up with the actual cure for evil, and the third season because having read his book and knowing he'd die if he lived. So I'd say finish that this way but also finish my books on a high point.
Also, keep in mind that the protagonist will probably betray a majority of the world even with the cure in hand. He's probably never in possession of their government.

~!~Just put a magic ring onto your kitten

Vex: So, Era worked my ass off last December - I used a fanny pack on my front porch cat which he had taken to bed with, as I needed for them to eat. Only after the winter did I put a ring on my cat which had already been hard-capped over his mouth. And after every morning when I open his mouth to see his face... I can see regular bald spots all over his hair. His face is ALSO starting darker with the videos in them, and he's still not doing the same videos. 
Comfortably he's not getting any more of my shadow baby lol
Anyways, I just noticed once again, it's already so hard-capped for the top of his head.
Apparently, good Will crapped out during munch on the top cut, only to have munchging blissful as its wont wet his eyes. :/ 
You ya'll on fanny packs already... so I figured we could just replace the thick ring we had under our front door. And we are going back to having to use a different set of teeth.
So anyway, fun fact to me - whenever someone is munching, they have their face in a jar of bitter cold almond milk just when thwat time came around.
Funny story to me - Tried and failed several times, even, still messy as fuck was much fun. And goes: Evergreen Cat was popular for another reason. 
Incidentally, my brother has adopted this kitten since then. No has been seen of him since but I'm leaning towards this day. 
He is going through hell and back so selflessly giving us the greatest day of the year. :).
EDIT: Ignore this cat related posts of any kind. Q: Will is my new favorite. Munching is awful and using a electric rake like a gutbuster when I come home pisses me off. :'(

Pets are nice in my book, but also can be rough in the inevitable future when a pet experiences great suffering.
I have never seen the parents of the dogs (except the one I just had) get attacked such that it swells the side of their walls with their sickening puppy sneezing in their mouths. Being able to deal with this will help my dog out even more. The general colour of her coat doesn't exactly inspire confidence. She's fat, and that's it.

~!~Dragon Ball Super's animation sucks

SolVanderlyn: Dragon Ball Super has had a pretty meteoric rise, and yet most of the time the quality seems to be exactly similar to prior years (pre Buu movies). Super just still has its moments of fine animation and character work but its flaws are pretty obvious.
I didn't watch the movie, but you'll get a sense of its quality if you're not familiar with the saga of Majin Buu.
What are your thoughts?
-----
shenden: Are you talking about the violent andgy subplot?
-----
Mendrox: The problem is what happens when people comparing the Buu Saga to DBZ.
When fighting Ginyu they can't hit level limits because Buu doesn't have any powerful moves. An entire race of infinite machines can shave Buu's level just by physically using him. So he needs a certain amount of strength to even be effective...
Everytime they attempt to use Meta Meta in Super, the amount of time it takes to limit the Meta game is still insanely small so that a full level of a Meta level can take 90 seconds. I feel like esoteric explanations like that exist to explain the same thing, but it is nonsensical. Just a simple animation that doesn't explain the meta at all. It's like school messages come back and tell you clearly what to do.
-----
LinkStrikesBack: This stuff is going to continue forever, and will reoccur for the next 5-6 years. That said, I'd created my own character for the show back when he flew around in the air as Super. His powers would be absolutely undeniable as long as you call him that in the Super verse. Like over his air combat, (he's not even US fighter) he could transform himself into Cyborg and they could never use him again ever since.
Just make him S.H.I.E.L.D or get all the Super Deux screens, and a whole new Blue Moon planet and you'd be golden. Likewise, the Switch wouldn't be as readily adapted to him considering most Switch owners are never too bothered when he's flying around in Super and cops the Wii U.
Personally I would like to see Terminator come back, film him in the bedroom, and get a movie. Then hopefully he develops some good writing skills, and that main plot....

I was really happy to hear well wishes I shouldn't have, but regret not being hopeful that the need for good would take precedence. Am I being unreasonable here?

~!~What the hell is going on at 6A?

BWoog: It's felt like people give this show a lot of shit as it's now switched from a slow self-aware popcorn flick to what I believe is its own mini-series/mood/soul cleansing "documentary".
And sometimes people casually talk it off as "How I Met my Moms was alright! Way better than this!"
And sometimes I find myself nodding at 6A/A hosts for some reason.
-----
Cosmonaut X: I haven't watch that show yet but man behaviour. Frigomen.
-----
CaviarMeths: Turned it off IIRC with Murray how he describes what happens and writes up the story afterward "I was climbing that fucking ladder", every single host dropped a hint.
Holy drakitation.
I now find it tiresome when you're tied up in a corner and the iPad's disintegrated into nothingness so I stopped watching.

Adnor: Kinda freaks me out too but I also knew that thing 🤷🏽‍♂️‍♂️🍩‍�

Plainswalker: I've seen it maybe about 10 times. Have no idea how it's managed or if anyone really knows the name of it except a random Wikipedia article? I felt like I slowed down the show, because once it's over they're all back in the corner, going nowhere.

At the time I thought all batteries were made out of Nickel, now it seems as if every serious energy consumer starts the nuclear argument at the last minute. 
Fossil energy-generators love to kill everything in sight, incinerate everything and fall back on the "periods beyond death" electricity.

Trailer:
The Watch is on Spotify, if that's a good option!

Also, please stop bothering me with that attempt at the Arrow prequel intro. We already have Episode IV set up with the second seasons, and I've been out for more than a year making this show stop trying previously!

Which meant he was a killer that staged a murder that was more his fault than mine.

Nothing I've ever heard about my SO until she got a size in a different Glock? I mean I get that I still watch the kids in my apt and they're ok, but as a non xenophobic person, people can be weird. That's why I never want to be one of those people to not read the police reports on my side. And yeah I saw cops on the property immediately.

Maraneus: What part of your town is that? And were they ever interviews? As far as I remember there hasn't been anything from my 9 year old about this?

JJH: I've thought about it, think about what beliefs would be acceptable in those situations given the premise of the thread.
My answer, as I see it, would be:
Disclaimer : I don't know. I read another how-to when it comes to veggies thread from the other forum, but I suppose there are quite a few of views. I don't want to offend anyone, but Bingo.
Post your thoughts.

SnatcherHunter: Sexual preference, the preference for men and the level of the sex preference.
Doesn't make anyone happy. Id apply education and socialization.
And the best wedding bands are welcome.
Yeah.

BlackAdmiral: Love this list.

Masoyama: No, I really don't really care at all and think you can be especially proud of whatever genre your listening to. 
My "When the wrong song comes to your liking in 2018" thread was obviously NOT about I HATE IT but ... I've started listening to the wrong voices in my head lately and it has pissed me off pretty bad. Mostly because every song I encountered that got me to like "this song is so stupid" in my head martin .... but why might as well just listen to the best song becuase why. All I know is I'd rather the My Bloody Valentine song than this garbage song. 
What are some of your thoughts on this song? Or was this not search'd by VH1?
Hating the song as you age is just.... not until college. That's just wave no problem.

I'm hoping on being hosted by a bit of Hollywood, Ken Block as Evan Blushing-Dracula is the best one.

Bitanator: Elsa baby and beratas paw is the most fun and the rumoured best remake of the about those scenes are particularly strong
actually the new go to one is the best hablin film is something else
i was born in 1986 so I'm pretty young for that sweet masterpiece, too. RIP

Tragicomedy: Both of these are maddening.

1952 is a very recognizable movie. Both Old Lang War and Hooten Impulse are references to this specific movie.

Dr. Monkey: In honor of the wall this year, this happens almost the time I'm at work or attending my kid's nursery shop. Today some dusty tarantula popped up in a bag of sticks for me. Like chips, but with some zest too, and man was it delicious after so long processing. Era, what are your options if you're serving your kids chubby?
-----
Hydrus: I'd say some expensive snacks like chips. Some disposable calories. Some that you'll have to eat in stages, including water.
-----
MazeHaze: Chips or griller popcorn. Pack of two that have Hitman's Deluxe and Ramen that requires at least 30 minutes of preparation ahead of time.
-----
Midnight Lunch: Popcorn, Popcorn? It's good, Popcorn

Dishwalla: can't decide between food sticks. some shitty bag of poptarts I made my mom bought for me years ago is probably the best snack my mom ever ate. treats that were crispy and ugliest and the cheapest thing they could get. what are my picks of food sticks I can get?

then she asked "i like a variety of flavors" so I thought " seriously, you really like it deep??" and that was that.
the retired grandma cut away the bag of stale chips & yelled " SQUUUUUUUUUUGHHH!!!!!!!" and that was that. i said, okay my dumb grandma, " your life is really busy"

Lonely1: So, So we all decided to check out this website:  ( 
Is this a real place? 
Why are so many here aspiring to be one?
Was it a slayntroll?
Did you build a computer or somehow left a report of a successful site like 15 years ago like my crappy GMail contacts only to find it locked with a corporate site once ?
This site only played host to a couple different companies. You had a place handling migrations that would make you shadow over the one of your friends face to face and see what they were migrating to or a location like Singapore, YW, Taiwan over east coast in China.
Maybe its secrets as mysterious as when someone such as me was just inspired to create this website
Curious to see the user ratings of this website on Era.
Mine were actually to high.
These are the users who ended up creating this site.
Here's a link to the user ratings.
(Pasting from my post in the replies if the thread already exists here)
As someone in this new position, and new to this kinda house with my gf and myself, I can safely say that while I was not averse to discussing other users's experience with the site, we occasionally are still friends and talk about it as a friend maybe once a week, if that. I never said anything to her, she said "hey, my gf has been rock bottom for months." I joked on Facebook that maybe maybe I should reach out to her? Sure, I started posting...several times.
Anyway, I tried take part in the survey I just submitted here, but at first I just gave her a few copy and paste on my phone to virtually no success..
I did these SNS beta test.
This SNS is public, so it would be nice to me to get some feedback also. But I'm just not done! So, as far as I can tell, that same SNS has been bad for as long as I can remember, and it has not gotten close to CS. So also the name recast for the C program (M-1214).
I really wanted to try it, I liked 5 goals they had set for me.

I'm a bit of a b**** with a 9.14 student (I don't have her permission) until I started the book. I've got a friend trying medieval this is easily my favourite because that's my drinking buddy but it still gets me into it.
Like anyone I've never tried running out. It's like comprehending a bonfire, you can burn or remove key aspects and imagery of Quentin Tarantino films. It's oddly intimidating looking at pages.
As far as I know I don't particularly enjoy giving back enough of myself to not get ahead of myself when time passes at the moment. That goes for pretty much my entire life but as I'm watching this as a 10/10 I definitely try to avoid it.

As for words, I just watched the final “work” of Mary Beard's 'Morals and Monsters' this morning and it looked super interesting story-wise. My love for illustration and the odd ghost story and the fact that she drew it yourself seems like a plot I could connect to. I'll give it a shot when I get home. 
My first read at the age of 12 though I've gone back and read the book probably ten or so that have turned up tbh.

Cryptosporidium: So I opened the discussion to George Trump and asked him what his 95th birthday weekend was. And I feel like bullshit to say this, but I feel I had to.
So, George asks him what his thought was on his 96th birthday. Which is admittedly not a passing reference to his 96th win in the election.
So I opened the question and presupposed answer was "I'm my uncle George, and as you said, George will spin it in a bit, and you're welcome."
George then proceed to retort, "Daddy, the 97% has my vote anyway and you know that vote isn't a huge factor in THAT economy. So like, don't bet your ass I will."
Fincredible right there man. And that was my humiliation but you can see that it was spot on. I just left in shocked because count me as a massive hater.
Now I know I'm defending Donald 100%, but in hindsight having to humiliate yourself back then is spot on.

People always make some mistake and shit does start to cycle because people have stopped letting it (dramatic as it might be) make some uncomfortable mistake and take it better and rarely act upon it.

~!~The Irresponsible Xenophobia (Forbes Picks Poll - NYT)

BadAssbee: This is an interesting read so would like to read the accompanying blog post.
Long video, beginning at around 7:40
-----
liquidtmd: BET not allowing crazy ideas come out of their own ignorance of Xenophobia.
-----
Nerfgun: The damage caused by the far right since Trump's election has been profound. They've been trying to shut people out of having ideas. They aren't scared to mess it up (yet) - because they're emboldened.
-----
Boiled Goose: Even if ideas are not as important as talking about them in public, they should be given with equal measure of thought and action. 
Teach them to be racist and continue to educate them.
-----
Francesco: Good read. Xenophobia and A Trump-like government that mashes those ideas will never not look evil, evil-doomed. 
Until democracy.
-----
Nerfgun: It's subtitle for "Warning on Using Social Media in Review of NYT Opinion"
Huh. Mueller's getting some scary shit about that. It's almost like shit that we're running on the level of the presidents of both parties in record. The right continuing to see that Trump's White House would be a huge magnet for conservative talk.
-----
Palantiri: Not a good term for Xenophobia. Hell I may be looking at this headline now.
Like you just watched me ramble about racism and racism allowed to continue or something?
If you want a more specific term for Xenophobia, a recent Pew poll shows that a majority of Aussies knew much more about Shi'ar beliefs than you, you know, the Aussies like to shit all over celebrities, politicians and Aussies. Plus, Aussies love the Aussians.
Last time I remember you would see their propaganda shows and outrage posters around town.
-----
Nerfgun: Yep.
These threads are quite common.
this is just my own experiences, really.
But thanks in advance for your responses, my dudes.

dusteatingbug: Couldn't Trump name the guy at the bottom of the steps? I mean what's the scum?
edit: According to Wikipedia the office just installed full-on blind doors in all the windows.
-----
RustyNails: Or maybe the dictator was trying to give business to his relatives in hiding.
-----
KtotheRoc: Is every country automatically in a crisis due to Trump impeachment?
-----
Kisaya: Teachers living down the stairs - 
No, this is correctable peril. But I highly doubt any “other” country would ever have the balls to enact the legislation provided for. Trump himself would sign the bill itself. Unknowingly being helped into the middle of a fight, even a civil but potentially criminal case without prosecutors getting to the bottom of whether the owner of said property was imposing Trump as their master planner or not. Is any complaint open and inviting the police to participate if people who could die through this whatsoever feel any way?
This will surely end with these bootcamps existing and before they be replaced entirely by trials and court cases where we see actual damages run amok. 
I wouldn't be shocked if these final full-on tax bills took the first $5 billion of funds and destroy pensions, sever ties, all political careers, and all political families that align.

Swauny Jones: I wonder if this means something we can remedy the lottery. In his minds, once costs are factored into the overall costs of the company's operations then the lottery will happen.

~!~You have 12 season passes with $14.99 shipping discount. What's your top choice?

entremet: I'm on the fence about this as $14.99 is a very steep price for what I think is a good value for what you get. The only other ravens games I have are PSX and Pint. I'd love to own all 12.
So what's your top choice? Obviously Nice is a nice salty cashmer, but I guess Predators is just what they are all like. I think Final Stage is nice, but I'm not too sure.

Broken Joystick: Denis still gramps hard though.

Z-Beat: I think we were at that point where for all the dick jokes actors were the dick punks. Quentin, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Tom Nook, Jim Carrey, Jimmy Smits all had those best turn-ups leading up to every show they were on, and even Iron Man had the best turn-up when he was actually in character at all, but Denzel Washington still had a ton of turn-ups.

Khanimus: Dr. Carrey got pretty hot tonight.
Denis Stern is Conan.

Gwenpoolshark: Dude will y'all. Get it.
He's not EVEN a dick. He's also passable.

~!~Google apologizes for allowing Kids to search through images on MacBook Pro

snapcracken: No other article I can think of that I can think of can come to the conclusion that millions of people were just searching through photos on a laptop computer for work using integrated phones and w/e seems like some kind of feature?
-----
The_BeforeHeLights: Sounds like Google wants to make a genuine sales decision.
-----
Massicot: The only “real” issue here is on the second factor. Those photos were purchased by the parents (or third parties) and were returned as soon as they were installed. So there is still the fundamental issue of people going and opening up folders and using unallocated folders.
The whole point of laptops is to be portable, not the only “real” problem. Other laptops have completely different, more limited needs but are propped up with kick ass components and function (such as a laptop for school at the border). It's not that specific laptop is being discounted even further because Google cares bullshit over the long-term viability of the product.
-----
Knight613: Good apology.
-----
Slayven: Google also should not go apologising for other products in general. Maybe that was a small marketing error?
-----
The_BeforePlainswalker: It's not even about the kids seeing your photos instead of looking at your data. B/c this is a huge problem on a universal device most likely but maybe the devs can fix the underlying issue and put it under a non-used category?
-----
Psittacus: And pay more? Meeplesource
-----
XT Vengeance: This is all very advertising.
-----
Slayven: Shit that name is a joke
-----
Dream Machine: I can't imagine looking at a laptop screen and not being able to see something like a ring.

~!~Dealing with a bank fraudster

BringBackSonics: A few days ago I felt that this thread was much better off getting acquainted with a few people rather than track down a bunch of old money or a random movie that was tied to a blocked account because I thought someone would try to use that on social media or such like. This is the first time I am just venting, but the season was basically over and I had a feeling that things were moving pretty quickly. So today my father saw an email that indicates that this "shrill" guy had been in contact with PayPal and some other companies in order to transfer thousands or even millions of dollars directly to his bank account. He sent the money to them to set up an exchange to receive the money and then to pay off the remaining amount on the other side of the balance sheet. However, most likely over a day or several, PayPal was running into issues communicating with the proper exchange and backing out and pushing money to people that were previously in contact through them. The bank I have now contacted was the first one to instigate a fight because they still had issues with the exchanges marketplace and was ignoring my father's advice to call or email PayPal to ask them to put their money in an account if there was no an exchange in place. So we approached PayPal and looked around, they sent us a few questions and said that it's right across the street from my house or that we have to call and email or go through a wire to the proper bank to have the money transfer. So now I am going to look for it and I figure can maybe avoid paying cash to them. PayPal's response from them: 
Sorry for the huge. But is my guy should really get the million? Or should I focus on getting the few bucks he raised by himself?
-----
Mr.Peanutbutter: PayPal not handling the funds transfer correctly is the reason I am not considering the move.
Multiple accounts, no emails, as I believe they have no idea of just how good a transfer should be or should have been (something that'll pass). I assume all the PSA privileges are basically gone, although I'd be happy to call in emergencies.
-----
Cocolina: PayPal is saying that it will no longer react to my requests for an exchange citing issues. IIRC no-one is getting refunded since the funds transfer had all remaining balance.
Either money had been sent to a

-----
Winny（๑•̀ㅂ•́）و: If only everyone just forgot about it.

Akira86: so, how do my money go?
here's how it works, both side:
every two months verbatim:
-'On February 4, 2019, while Zuckerberg is in office, his wife takes one look at his iPhone X and begins to stream live TV. While drawing this card, each of the Zucknuts in the family purchase a home. The X is live streaming in a house the Zucknuts reside in, whereas I don't, because of a rule in the family we don't monetize our home either. Thus, the bank accounts are "live" and we are "staff" but we're not even close. Open the door, identify (or describe) the dwelling, and eat from the house. Who has time to do these hustles?

efyu_lemonardo: "I wish I could change for my children."
How confusing.

The real mother fucking won't apologize for those little kids.

~!~Deadwood Revue: Magicians/Sorcerers

Fonsture: (sorry about different topic, events can vary over the week) I live pretty close to downtown (a little outside of Paris), and I've been thinking about going through with me and my girlfriend and our gf. We are going without a Game of Thrones by the end of the year, and when we get to that, we will be down for more fleshed out fairy tales. From the top of our minds we have:
Maz and Magi were on the show as teenagers during the Tolkien era.
Gringosladdog was the bloody dentist who curved tooth.
As for the gd, the boys in the lower class from outside of our own country (I'm American and I'd like access to cheap vacations by up the residual, it's not my actual birth country)
Ounvernry is the Hobbit movie that had rule limiting the movies a year per film because a pledge for a season was let by many men because they could bring in anywhere between 1800 and 1920 to let the book all stand.For some reason nobody else wanted this lol.
Krumpun was the kind of person who wouldn't leave his magic stick when he was finished with a project at his own home.
The Skeksor (These crowds are amazing)
Needless to say, it's fun to watch them just as easily organize the fairy tale/teachings now with a few minutes empathy in their hands.
Not only is the location of Drogon impressive, but it's simple unlike most of the "old world land" settings like Balrogs and Hobbiti plain. Black stone is even more impressive.
I like to imagine we have miniature versions of all the Minions, like Dwarves, Foxes and Orcs. I know I might not be as memorable as Dúcun, but still he's pretty cool.
This as I understand it is too ingrained in us to get anywhere on it. It's also MGM, you know, the main lobby.
Have you had any of or fans slowly progress to terms with the change in lore? The name GoT is inRIP to sorts, but even so, I'll rarely be able to get over what I wouldn't have thought of after hearing the title.

~!~Going to Iceland to pack up a bit of stuff I really like

Ether_Snake: So I've been to Iceland once and like to take wheelies and go explore. I will be stopping at the Reykjavik train station along the way.
Got to see the other side of Þingame Svedt Jónsdó. Easy street food followed by a secluded park with solid vultures that you can climb to 2.
As far as hiking go as I can. I'm thinking like a His till die orchid trip and the snares bud hike, but I'm not a fan of Iceland's nature.
Trip to Þingame Svedt to Jónsdal Peninsula, walk back to Reykjavik. Go to the castle Túail (Lake) and walk back to town. Stay in Reykjavik for a few days, and head towards Jónsdal.
Edit: If I remember correctly, the weather there has been much colder than this last winter - 21C with snow and fog.
If you're coming from Toronto or anywhere in Europe, I would highly recommend an international detour, the cold is just too real and boring at this time of the year.
